> There is a widespread illusion that "as one ages, one's [[level]] automatically increases," but [[age]] is nothing more than "[[play time]]," and what is needed for [[raising the level of]] is "[[XP]]. If you leave it on until the morning, [[play time]] will increase on its own. There is not much information that can be read from age.

> It's easy to understand that you don't gain experience if you leave the slime alone, but it's more problematic when you keep on killing [[slimes]] and people think "I can kill slimes easily now, I'm strong" or "I'm doing well, I'm gaining experience, and I'm getting stronger".

>  If your job is to defeat slime, that should be enough.
>  The only question is, how long do we have the "slime slaying job"? If I can get away with it, I'll be happy with that.
>  People can never let their guard down, but they can never waste their lives over-preparing for an "enemy" that will never come.
>  If the "job of slaying slime" looks like it will be there for 100 years, don't worry if all you can do is slay slime. It's just a question of whether you can see it through successfully.

I don't think anyone who has never been out of the slime forest can judge if there is likely to be 100 years of "slime slaying business."

- As of 2024-09-17 I feel that "the job of slaying slime will be done by AI in the next 10 years".
