Discretization of real numbers

Haar wavelet.

The real number, `[0, 1]`, is regarded as the probability that 1 is chosen from {0, 1}. For example, a ray of light reflected on a surface with a reflectance of 0.8 is not traced by multiplying the brightness by 0.8, but by total reflection with a probability of 0.8, thereby reducing the amount of calculation for the remaining 0.2.

In the planetarium Megastar, the stars are displayed as a stochastic gradation to cover the misalignment caused by the boundary of the lens.

Represent intermediate colors by [[dithering]] in an environment with few colors.

Discretization of real numbers explains how to convert real numbers in `[0, 1]` to `{0, 1}`. Specifically, the real number is considered as the probability that 1 is chosen, which reduces the computational complexity. For example, a ray of light reflected on a surface with a reflectance of 0.8 has a 0.8 probability of being totally reflected, thereby reducing the amount of calculation for the remaining 0.2. In addition, in the planetarium Megastar, the stars are displayed as stochastic gradations to cover the misalignment caused at the boundaries of the lenses. Furthermore, we introduce a method to represent intermediate colors by dithering in an environment with a small number of colors.

The relevance of fragment X ("1297902929*What is a random variable?") to the note is in the connection between random variables and the discretization of real numbers. In the note, the discretization is done by considering the real number as the probability that 1 is chosen. Fragment X, on the other hand, discusses the fact that the random variable is a function of Ω → R and what makes it different from a probability distribution. These are related in terms of the connection between probability and real numbers and how they are handled.

Reading the notes and Fragment X, one can see that the relationship between probability and real numbers is important. In particular, it shows how treating real numbers as probabilities can reduce computational complexity and represent phenomena. This shows that understanding and exploiting the relationship between probability and real numbers can lead to more efficient calculations and more precise representations.

### Summary of notes
.
This section explains the discretization of real numbers. Specifically, real numbers are regarded as the probability of 1 being chosen, thereby reducing computational complexity. In addition, in the planetarium Megastar, the stars are displayed as stochastic gradients to cover the misalignment caused at the boundary of the lenses. Furthermore, we also show how dithering can be used to represent intermediate colors in an environment with a small number of colors.

### Relation to fragment X

The relevance of fragment X ("1297902929*What is a random variable?") to the note is in the connection between random variables and the discretization of real numbers. In the note, the discretization is done by considering the real number as the probability that 1 is chosen. Fragment X, on the other hand, discusses the fact that the random variable is a function of Ω → R and what makes it different from a probability distribution. These are related in terms of the connection between probability and real numbers and how they are handled.
