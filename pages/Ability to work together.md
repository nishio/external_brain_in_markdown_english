Ability to work together

The political philosopher Hannah Arendt said that power is essentially "the ability of people to agree and act together," and that it does not belong to individuals but exists only insofar as people are gathered together.
- This view suggests that true power and legitimacy derive from consensual acts in the public sphere (i.e., consent as a commons). Conversely, coercively imposing only the outcome does not constitute sustainable power; the process by which people "decided together" in the first place is the source of legitimacy.
- In a modern democratic society, trust in such a consensus process, or a sense of consensus, is a valuable commons, and the challenge is how to foster and maintain it.
