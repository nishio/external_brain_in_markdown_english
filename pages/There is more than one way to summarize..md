- From the discussion on [Fractal Summary

- There is more than one way to summarize.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Since [[summarizing is discarding information of low value]], [[how to summarize depends on the subjective values of the user]].
        - A partial [[delve into]] of the [[High Layer Summary]] in the [[Fractal Summary]] can be seen as a statement by the user of the value of the information.
        - [[Liquefaction not summary]]
        - To generalize.[[ある側面は保ったまま他の部分を変える]]ことで、[[さまざまなvariantを作り出す]]している」といえそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>

            - The [[axis leg]] is fixed and the other leg is moving.
            - What's good about doing that in information is that it [[generates content connected through the axes]].

I think this discussion offers a very thought-provoking perspective on summarizing and transforming information.
First, it is noted that summarization is not only a process of compressing information, but also of highlighting important information by discarding less valuable information. And since which information is important depends on the subjective values of the user, there is no single method of summarization.
The user's behavior of digging only partially through the high layer summary of the fractal summary can be viewed as a statement of the value of the information. This can be interpreted as the user selectively trying to gain a deeper understanding of the information that is important to them.
Furthermore, instead of a summary, the concept of "liquefaction" is proposed. This refers to the creation of different variations by keeping some aspects and changing others. By creating variations that take the form of summary level, language, and unjargoned state chat, flexible transformation of information is possible.
This process is analogous to the pivot in basketball. Just as the pivot foot is fixed and the other feet are moved, in the transformation of information, one part of the information is shifted around an axis and the other parts are changed to produce content that is connected through the pivot foot.
And it is pointed out that this structure of "shared axes" and "individually optimized other legs" also plays an important role in Asymmetric Reality. It is emphasized that the virtual time axis, spatial arrangement, and text structure are the axis legs, through which the content is connected.
This discussion suggests that liquefaction and pivoting transformation of information may play an important role in intellectual production using LLM; using LLM to flexibly transform information and optimize it for user values may enable more effective structuring and utilization of knowledge.
Also, from the perspective of Asymmetric Reality, we may be able to explore a new way of intellectual production by utilizing LLM to set up a "shared axis leg" from which various variations can be created.
The talk will share with the audience the new possibilities for intellectual production offered by LLM by touching on the relationship between [[Varieties of Summary]], [[Fractal Summary]], [[Liquefaction of Information]], [[Pivotal Transformation]], and [[Asymmetric Reality]]. These concepts suggest new paradigms in the structuring and utilization of knowledge and should stimulate the intellectual curiosity of the audience.
Please incorporate the content of this discussion into your presentations and provide us with deep insights into your vision of the future of intellectual production using LLM. We believe this would be an important step forward in presenting a new model of intellectual production.
