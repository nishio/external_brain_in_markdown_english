- Movement by Trigger
    - I can think of two ways.
        - Pull the trigger to grab and release to drop
        - Trigger click to move mode, click again to put it there.
    - I think the former is more natural.
        - Distance can be controlled by swiping up and down while grabbing.
            - UI used in [Virtual Virtual Reality
- Trigger will only take one piece, so swipe in front of it to suck out multiple pieces, then spit them out elsewhere #Suck it out
    - The problem of not being able to figure out what has been sucked out of the system.
        - Why not just display it around the controller?
- How to move to another location
    - Swipe left or right while grabbing to fly?
        - Users need to remember where anything swiped left or right will jump to.
    - breathe in and breathe out
        - Users need to know that they are being sucked out.
