title: "Subjective Assumptions"

> There is a pattern that serial entrepreneurs get into, "[[Neglecting small business opportunities]]", so I want to keep that in mind.

> I think there is another axis, which is the case that as one's network of contacts grows and friends of various entrepreneurs increase, one sometimes thinks, "I hope I don't have to do it myself in this area," and the necessary "[[Subjective Assumptions]]" are not generated in the early stages of business creation. I think there are sometimes cases where the "Subjective Assumptions" necessary in the early stages of business creation are not generated.

The idea that "Mr. X is better at this than me, so I don't have to do it myself" often appears, so I caution myself against it.
If you don't do it because you're not that interested, that's fine.
If you are interested but think "Mr. X is better at this" and let it disappear without taking any action.
It would just be "[[Looking for reasons not to]]".
- I want to find something that I can have [[passion]] for.
