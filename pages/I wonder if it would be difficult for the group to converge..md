I wonder if it would be difficult for the group to converge.
What's on my mind right now:.
- We can let the human population diverge.
- I wonder if it's difficult to do [[convergence]] in a group.
- [[Convergence is left to the individual.]]
    - When it comes to "[[AI helps build consensus]]," it seems important to support the "convergence phase.
    - Even if diverged efficiently by AI, if humans cannot converge, it will explode.
    - [[How can we support convergence?"]]
- Few people are able to proceed with meta-awareness of the convergence phase, rather than "just kind of doing it at random".
    - I'm not trained to do it.
    - In short, it is a skill to do a [[KJ method]] kind of thing...
