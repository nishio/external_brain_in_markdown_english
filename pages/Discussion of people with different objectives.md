title: "Discussion of people with different objectives"
---

Discussions between people who are not working together toward a [common goal
- That this is not the same as a "good" discussion in an organization working together toward a common goal.
- So is it "bad"?
        - [Not good or bad, but beneficial or unbeneficial.
            - [[Monarch Morality and Slave Morality]]
    - In the default state, where no organization is formed, it is a natural phenomenon.
            - [[A state of war of all against all]]
        - Organizations are created to try to create something more beneficial than that.
        - Organizations are created by attracting "people who are beneficial to the organization's objectives" and eliminating "people who are detrimental.
                - The same [[biological boundaries]] that were created by [membrane
            - Membrane separates the inside and outside of the cell.
        - The [[aligned]] vectors of people gathered in an organization produce something useful.
    - In the past, organizations tended to make a clear distinction between those on the inside and those on the outside, but I've come to realize that there are cases where it works without a clear distinction.
        - [[Open Source Development]]
                - [[Monastery and Bazaar]]
        - It's [[a private club]] if you differentiate between those inside and those outside and only allow certain people to enter.
                - Context of [Bazaar and Clubs
        - I don't think open source development is completely bazaar-like.
            - If there is no authority to decide whether to merge into the main branch or not, there will be chaos.
                - Linus is not making merge decisions democratically, etc.
    - Are [[permissionless]] yet profitable organizations possible through the various incentive and decision-making mechanisms under study around DAOs?
        - It is "possible" because there are successful examples. Claims of "impossible" are disproven.
        - On the other hand, there's no mechanism that has been discovered to bring about a high probability of success in newly created DAOs.
        - I think it is possible to manage the conventional 0/1 situation where "organizations are created by attracting those who are beneficial to the organization's goals and eliminating those who are detrimental" by some kind of token, while achieving the same or greater effect.
        - Aside from that, for the time being, it seems to be a highly accurate prediction to assume that the permission-less group will be [[crowding]].

People who grow up in a good environment perceive the "air in the [[private club]]" as the default.
- But it's an air that only exists in private clubs built by people who thought that air was good
        - [[The parable of the greenhouse-grown seedling]]
