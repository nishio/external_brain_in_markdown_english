- The discount rate for future value varies from person to person.
    - The figure says hyperbolic discounting, but hyperbolic discounting is different because we are talking about a (irrational) reduction in the discount rate itself [hyperbolic discounting - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8C%E6%9B%B2%E5%89%B2%E5%BC%95).
    - Stanford's [Marshmallow Experiment - Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AD%E5%AE](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AD%E5%AE) %9F%E9%A8%93]
- A person with a higher discount rate estimates a higher future value that is balanced by the current $10,000.
    - So we tend to choose "what we want now" from a variety of options.
- When the discount rate is somewhat lower, the average growth rate of people and stocks is greater
    - When it comes to that,
        - Better to invest for the long term in stocks than to get cash now.
        - Better to benefit others than to benefit yourself now (assuming a [[retro-return policy]])
- Selfish decisions to maximize one's own future profits result in the behavior of "giving to others rather than taking for oneself.
    - This is seemingly [[altruistic]] behavior.
    - But in reality, it is just a [[long-term investment]].
- Identification of either
    - If for some reason the other party's future [[growth rate]] is low
        - Altruism should be unaffected since it has nothing to do with future growth, etc.
        - Long-term investments are affected
