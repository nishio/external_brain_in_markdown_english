title: "What is through"
---

Context: [[Meaningful conversations can start with two people]].

T:
- What does [[through]] do in the first place?
N:
- To "go through" is to do nothing, which is the standard human state. However, with the advent of the Internet, the number of people with whom we can communicate has exploded, resulting in a different form of communication than in the past, Communities are being born.
T:
- About going through it, you mean you read it and do nothing, right?
N:
- yeah
- You don't have to read it.
- You can glance at it and skip over it, it doesn't demand that you read and understand it.
T:
- I feel it's important to focus on through
- I think that "through" means that after reading quickly, you "stop thinking about it" for some reason, such as you don't understand it, you are not interested in it, it's boring, or you don't understand the context.
- But the important thing is that it [[stays in the back of your mind]]. This is what I mean by "going through it," not that I didn't read it completely or anything.
- So we think there is quite a difference between those who went through A, B and C and those who never read ABC in the first place.
- There are times when I do not take Nishio-san's words seriously, and then later realize, "Did he mean that? I sometimes do that.
- I felt that way.
