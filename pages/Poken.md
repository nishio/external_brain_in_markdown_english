[Poken, which was a new era of business card exchanges: The challenges and future of profile exchanges](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2112/28/news103.html)
> Tiny gadget that allows "touch" to exchange profiles.
>  Poken is a small gadget the size of a keychain with a USB port and characters such as animals and aliens on both sides. As mentioned above, it is a profile exchange gadget that allows users to register various profiles, such as their name, e-mail address, SNS account, and blog URL, and exchange them with the Poken of the other party.

I explained [[VESS Card]] as "something like a Poken," but he didn't get the message.

    - >  In that sense, [[VESS Card]] is likely to generate a strong viral effect because the other side can touch it if their phone has an NFC reader.
