title: "Full-time employment = 48 years non-cancelable subs."

- [[permanent employment]] compared to subs.
> If you hire a college graduate, you have to hire him for 48 years.
>  Like [[subscriber]] who can't cancel for 48 years. No matter how cheap it is, you don't want to sign a contract. You never know where the updates will stop.
