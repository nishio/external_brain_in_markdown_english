title: "🤔 screen height and virtual keyboard issues"
---

from  [[I want to ✅Add to Home screen]]
- In standalone mode, the screen is longer in height.
- At this time, the relationship between the position of the virtual keyboard and the position of the input field is misaligned and stressful.
- It is not necessary to make it standalone, so it will not be a problem in the immediate future, but screen size will eventually change, so it will need to be addressed in the future.
