- When human A says X, he often uses it in a narrower sense than the dictionary definition of X
    - Strictly speaking, it has to be narrowed by adding various words, but it is vaguely spread out by human beings saving that effort.
- Often, person B, who hears it, interprets it differently from what A assumes.
    - It tends to happen when the context or the premise of the story isn't shared well enough.
- At this time, B interprets the word "Y" as "in short, Y" and uses the word "Y" without permission.
- For B, he may feel that "X=Y clearly from the context so far," but if Y does not overlap with his idea of X for A, then it is natural to interpret it as "B brought up the new Y as a different concept from X."
- B's use of the new word Y magnifies the problem.

What would be an appropriate link to put on this story?
    - [[Discussion Failure Patterns]]
        - [[discussion]]
    - [[human bug]] Not so much?
    - Until now, most "human bugs" have been OS-level bugs, but this is an app-level image.
    - But either way, is it a bug?
    - [[semantic range]]
    - [[Both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible.]]
    - [[Interpretive sway of proximity of meaning]]
