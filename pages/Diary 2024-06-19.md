- [[A world where social capital is king]]
- [[Find value in it while others think it's worthless.]]
- [[early adopter group]]

I mean, "take a position while others think it's worthless" is a good long-term strategy for an individual, but it's not so good when it's a race for recognition with a deadline.
- I can see how name-calling and other behaviors can be triggered as a quick name recognition strategy.

> [Anfang_Ende](https://x.com/Anfang_Ende/status/1802717495620690148) There are many issues that need to be addressed this month, and thanks to you, my brain has become so noisy that it makes me nauseous, and at the same time I feel this matter again.
>  >[nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1731497929188499491) "There is an exploratory space here" type thinking as opposed to "high risk low risk" type thinking. People who don't move are perceived as "people who don't explore" and are "outside the space" and "not particularly worthy of attention."

- This might be better cut out and become a stand alone page.

> [fpocket](https://x.com/fpocket/status/1801674056066011531) I think this is a good book for a better understanding of Plurality. I think it concentrates on concepts that are important for thinking about intelligence, science, language, democracy, capitalism, etc. As the author states, I think Kolmogorov complexity is essential in discussing human intelligence. The discussion of value systems is in some ways similar to the philosophy of Gyuto Emorya.
[[Mathematics as Metaphor]]
> [fpocket](https://x.com/fpocket/status/1802932828776411235) What the generating AI is generating is essentially words (basis) for compressing information, and the generation of words also seems to make possible the exchange of information that could not be exchanged before. I think that the generation of words enables the exchange of information that could not be exchanged before. I feel that things like mental images may also become directly exchangeable. This is the future that lies beyond broad listening.
> [fpocket](https://x.com/fpocket/status/1802935150399140082) One of the factors that Plurality sees as difficult is the lack of words that share a subjective worldview. The language produced by generative AI may create a new art form that can share a subjective worldview. I think that large-scale language models may transform the mode of information exchange that has relied on natural language.

[Communication updated via AI -- Interview with Yukino Baba, Associate Professor, Graduate School of the University of Tokyo (2)| Here's a hint for the next breakthrough IT Critique [https://it-hihyou.com/recommended/ai%](https://it-hihyou.com/recommended/ai%) E3%82%92%E4%BB%8B%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%97%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3 83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3/]
> Yes, there is bias inside AI, but with a few tweaks to the model, it is much easier to reduce bias than with humans.
The discussion experiment with high school students without and with AI was interesting: Without AI, the "confident" students who actively spoke out came to the conclusion that the "unconfident" were burdened by their viewpoints, but by collecting opinions in advance and classifying them with AI, the students were able to think more multilaterally by taking each viewpoint and metaizing their own perceptions. I was able to think from multiple perspectives.


> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1655917208495874049) I told the Prime Minister that one of the risks of generating AI is that it is easy to create deep fakes. I thought it would be easier to understand if there was a demonstration, so I used a voice-over called RVC and did an impersonation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1802942974307045831) The shift to closed communities such as Discord is accelerating because of the inability to have proper discussions on open social networking sites such as Twitter
>
>  I feel that open study groups, where you don't know who is going to be there (like just a bunch of people eating at a restaurant), are being shunned. I think they will become more and more closed in the future.
> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1802943302159008250) We are entering an era where trust and confidence and give and take are important, I think we are.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1803232164571652239) Moderating discussions on open social networking sites for the better is gradually becoming possible with the development of LLM technology, and is an important component in building the society of the future. I think it will be.


I am.
I saw someone use Claude and said, "You're a Claude guy?"
I also use ChatGPT...
What do you mean by "school"? It's like asking which school you prefer, the train or the bus, and of course you'll use whichever is more convenient for your purpose.

> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1802735572039209227) The lament of popular OSS developers: "We're **taken lightly** because we're free**, and we're blamed when we jump aside to meet unreasonable demands. I think we have no choice but to think of it as "free of charge**, therefore **lighted**. In addition, I think the "freely available" nature of the service also adds to the tendency to disregard it.
>
>  I think that respect is difficult to achieve without "bleeding ourselves" in the form of "money" (or some alternative) (I hear that paying money actually activates the part of the brain responsible for physical pain). Or we "get on the developer's side" ourselves.

> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1803148873105658219) Make what you need as much as you can make yourself. I don't force myself to make what I don't need, don't feel the need for, or can't make. I don't make things for others. Make for your own needs and aesthetics. If I make for myself, it is easier for me to get by without worrying if others disrespect me. I believe it comes down to this.
> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1803151763648004445) As a user, don't ask too much. When the maker's and user's own motives do not match, do not bite back too much, and give up if they refuse. Limit your involvement and expectations to the extent that you can be thankful for it, without building up dissatisfaction or resentment toward the maker. If you go any further, consider it as a time to become the creator yourself. I guess that's about it.
> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1803242133585010823) I think going beyond this (making things you don't use, seeking the realization of things that don't match the creator's motives no matter what) is the realm of "business" or "operations" or whatever. [[piro_or ]] If it is to be undertaken as a business, it is necessary to have an estimate of how much profit it can contribute to the bottom line. If you do it without a clear vision, you will not be able to continue and will go bankrupt. I think this is what it means.
>  (I think that's why it's easier to continue if it's something you do for your company, if it's for your own use, or for your company's philosophy, etc.)
> [piro_or](https://x.com/piro_or/status/1803379041594159361) This is a "if you want to keep it going for a long time, if you want the project to live long, don't push too hard" kind of thing. If you don't want the project to live long, I think it's possible to take all the requests and push too hard, gain popularity in a short period of time, and sell out.
