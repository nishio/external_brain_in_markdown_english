> The horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence that causes [[Problematic choices in the long run]] when the depth of the [[search]] algorithm is set to [[finite]], because it does not consider subsequent paths as if they were beyond the [[horizon (related to sea or lakes)]]. This is a problem in artificial intelligence.
