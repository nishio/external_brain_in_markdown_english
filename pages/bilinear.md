title: "bilinear"
---

defined by the vector space V on the coefficient body F [[bilinear format]] B: V × V → F is
- $B(u + v, w) = B(u, w) + B(v, w)$
- $B(u, v + w) = B(u, v) + B(u, w)$
- $B(\lambda u, v) = B(u, \lambda v) = \lambda B(u, v)$
Satisfy the following.

As a concrete example, consider the inner product $B(u, v) = u \cdot v$, which satisfies the above conditions.
