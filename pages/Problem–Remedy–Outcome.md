The PRO (Problem-Remedy-Outcome) model was proposed by [[Penny Tompkins]] and [[James Lawley]] in the context of [[clean language]] / [[symbolic modeling]]. coaching] proposed by [[Penny Tompkins]] and [[James Lawley]]. The main focus is "to keep the client's attention on the [[desired state]] (Outcome) and not be consumed by [[problem talk]] or immediate [[prescription (medical)]] (Remedy). ([Clean Language](https://cleanlanguage.com/coaching-for-pros/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What the model does (the gist of the formula)
- When the coach first asks, "And what would you like to have happen? (And what would you like to have happen?), the client's response usually falls into one of Problem/Remedy/Outcome. PRO is used as a navigation diagram to carefully reorient to Outcome. ([ResearchGate [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279541687_Symbolic_Modelling_Emergent_Change_though_Metaphor_and_Clean_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279541687_Symbolic_Modelling_Emergent_Change_though_Metaphor_and_Clean_) Language?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- The model itself is not a "technique" but a "framework" for modeling the client's subjective world and facilitating self-modeling, and the questions are supposed to be "clean" (without any interpretation or guidance from the coach). The questions are supposed to be "clean" (no interpretation or guidance by the coach). ([Clean Language](https://cleanlanguage.com/coaching-for-pros/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

How to use it in coaching (examples of good questions)
- Establish Outcome
    - If this session goes well, what exactly is happening?"
    - How can that be observed (by whom, when, which indicators)?"
    - *PRO recommends proceeding with Outcome priority. ([Clean Learning](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/blog/discuss/the-pro-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- No one can be fooled by the Problem
    - (When they start talking about the problem) "When you have it, what would you like it to be instead?"
    - What's the smallest sign that you're one step closer to that state?"
    - *The Clean Community also states that people are easily drawn to problems/prescriptions and need to be consciously trained to return to Outcome. ([Clean Learning](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/blog/discuss/problems-remedies-outcomes?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- If you jump to Remedy (prescription)
    - What will you be able to see/hear/measure when that approach works?"
    - What if we were to make it a minimal experiment?"
    - PRO serves as a stopper to "check Outcome before formulating". ([Clean Language](https://cleanlanguage.com/coaching-for-pros/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

15-minute mini session script (PRO compliant)
1. Outcome agreement (3 minutes): "What do you want to happen?" → verbalize to observation method. ([Clean Learning](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/blog/discuss/the-pro-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. problem is short (5 minutes): fact-finding -> immediate "So what's the alternative?" to Outcome. ([Clean Learning](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/blog/discuss/problems-remedies-outcomes?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Remedy is "experimental" design (5 minutes): minimum experimentation / success signs / point of review. ([Clean Language](https://cleanlanguage.com/coaching-for-pros/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
4. commit (2 minutes): when and what to review.

Differences between similar and dissimilar frameworks
- Although it can be used with general models such as GROW, PRO specializes in language driving support to return "story types (which tend to flow to Problem/Remedy)" back to Outcome. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9482416/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- It is characterized by the fact that it is the opposite of the general problem-solving procedure of "Problem -> Countermeasure -> Result," where the Outcome (intention) is fixed first and then brought down to the minimum necessary action.
