When I explained that a certain tool was useful, I was told, "If it is useful, why don't you introduce it to everyone?" I felt uncomfortable with this decision. Only those who need it should use it.

## Why "[[only]] those who need it"?
- Efficiency and economy: Introducing the tool to everyone is a waste of resources. Learning costs are wasted, especially for those who do not need the tool. Maximize the ROI (return on investment) by ensuring that only those who need it use it.
- Customization and adaptability: Tools are designed to solve specific problems. Therefore, they should be used specifically for the people with that problem. This approach allows tools to be customized and adapted more effectively.
- Learning and Growth: The use of the tools by those who need them encourages deeper understanding and knowledge acquisition. This leads to increased expertise and ultimately to more efficient use of the tools.

## ["need" cognitive ability
.
Perceptions of "need" vary widely among individuals and groups. It is based on knowledge, experience, cultural background, as well as personal values and priorities. Thus, perceptions of what is "necessary" are shaped by the following factors
- Knowledge and Information: The quantity and quality of information an individual has has a significant impact on what they perceive as a "need". People with access to the right information can more clearly understand their needs and choose the right tools.
- Experience: past experiences influence how people perceive their future needs. Through experience, people learn what worked or was needed.
- Cultural background and values: Culture and values also influence what is perceived as "necessary". Social norms and beliefs shape individual choices and priorities.
- Dialogue and Consultation: In-group dialogue and consultation form the perception of "need" at the group level. This allows the group to take action based on shared needs.

- Conclusion
The "only those who need it should use it" approach is a rational choice in terms of efficiency, economy, and customization. However, in order to implement this approach, it is essential that individuals and groups accurately identify their "needs" and are able to make appropriate decisions based on them. This requires a complex cognitive process that is shaped through information, experience, cultural context, and in-group dialogue and consultation.
