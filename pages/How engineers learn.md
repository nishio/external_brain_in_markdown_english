Article written as a special project for [[Gijutsu Hyoron Co.]] WEB+DB PRESS Vol. 80, released on 2014-04-24.
[available on the Technical Review website at](http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying).

The introductory article I wrote for Hatena Diary at the time [I wrote "How to Learn to be an Engineer.](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20140427/1398524475), reprinted at:.

Vol. 80 itself was released in April, so it was titled "Welcome Newcomers! and "How to Learn to be an Engineer" is also intended for readers who will be working or going to school in April. How to Learn to be an Engineer" is also intended for readers who will be working or going on to higher education in April. However, we are sure that the contents will be useful for other people as well.

What inspired me to write this article was a column in my best-selling book, "[[Technology Supporting Coding]]. I was asked to write a column because I had some extra space, and I wrote several columns about how to learn.

- p.23「 [[Output first to confirm understanding]] 」
- p.26「 [[Why I don't know what to learn]] 」
- p.79「 [[Concrete and abstract knowledge]] 」
- p.80「 [[crunch]] 」
- p.82「 [[nibble from where you need to]] 」
- p.134「 [[Grab a rough idea and gradually flesh it out.]] 」
- p.235「 [[begin one's sutra reading from end to end]] 」

This column has been very well received and praised by many people. For example, an Amazon reviewer wrote

> The columns that are not directly related to the purpose of this book were especially excellent for me.
> "What to do when your mind is overwhelmed by the vast amount of information" is the prescription, albeit a short one.
> This column alone was worth the price of the book (at least for me).

I am very happy to receive your evaluation, but actually, as the author, I am not satisfied with the results. In order to fill the margins of the column, I had to cram in a limited number of words, so I had to cut some parts out. In addition, because the columns were published in bits and pieces, some "connections" were inevitably sacrificed.

We were able to write 17 pages on this subject in this special issue of "How Engineers Learn". Here is the table of contents:

    - [How to learn efficiently --- [[Three Axes of Knowledge]] and [[Three Phases of Learning]]
    - [[How to take the first step]]  ---  [[Learn where you need to go.]] 、 [[Get the big picture]] 、 [[copy a sutra]]
    - [[How do we understand it in depth?]]  ---  [[Comparison]] 、 [[Learning from History]] 、 [[Learn by making]]
    - [[What you will learn]], [[What to make]] --- [[How to find the problem]] and [[How to achieve results]].

If you compare this to the columns in "The Art of Coding," you will see that the knowledge is networked together. The chapter "How to understand a language deeply" is less connected to the columns, but it is in harmony with the first chapter "[[To learn a language deeply and efficiently]]" in "The Art of Supporting Coding.

In other words, this special project, "How Engineers Learn," is "the art of learning that supports 'the art of coding. Although "How Engineers Learn" is written in such a way that it is safe to read by itself, it is even better when read together.

We hope you enjoy it. Thank you for your continued support.
