- Many people think that it is [[death]] to be [[cut]] from [[permanent transcendent X]], thinking that [[physical body]] is you, but if you think that X's side is you ([[union with the One]]), then you were simply connected to the body as a temporary sensor + actuator, and information was flowing in and out of the body. The disconnection is not death because you were simply connecting to the body as a temporary sensor + actuator and moving it around while exchanging information.
