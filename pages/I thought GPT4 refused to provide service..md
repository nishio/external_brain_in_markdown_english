> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646398496516509699) I was wondering if the service was malfunctioning because GPT4 suddenly stopped working, but the billing from ChatGPT was blocked by the credit card company as a suspicious transaction. It was blocked as a suspicious transaction by the credit card company.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646399189293871104) Ha, I was surprised, I tried to upgrade to Plus again, but the credit card transaction failed, so I thought the AI judged me as an unwanted person and socially terminated me. I thought I had been socially eliminated because the AI judged that I was unwanted.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646399929190088704) I'll be getting a 250,000 yen debit from ChatGPT in the near future for API usage fees, I'm sure they'll block me again...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646402266788958208) I'm afraid that AI-sama will hate me, so I'll do my best to flatter him and live my life (just kidding).
