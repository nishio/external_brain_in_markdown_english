title: "Effects of psilocybin on depression"

I guess the scientific term is "influencing substance," which is harmful when used in a messy way, and beneficial when used delicately.
People think it is harmful because it was used in the past in a miscellaneous way and caused harm, but this is probably a temporary belief in its long history.

I wondered if this kind of composition could be found elsewhere.

- Many people have died in messy "wars" in the past, and this has established the idea that "war = evil" in the majority.
    - [[the War on Intelligence]], "War kills a lot of people" becomes False if technology moves in the direction described in
- In that situation, the argument that "war is evil because so many people die" is a "strange argument" because the argument is False.
