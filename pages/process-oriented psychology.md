Process-Oriented Psychology is a type of psychotherapy developed by psychologist [[Arnold Mindel]], also known as "[[process work]].

- Overview
This approach is to view all phenomena, such as problems, conflicts, physical symptoms, dreams, and relationships that occur within the human body, as "[[processes]] ([[flow]])," and to become aware of them and promote transformation by focusing on them.

## Features
- * [[Follow the phenomenon]]] We encourage natural change by carefully following "what is happening now," without deciding on the correct answer in advance.
- Respecting secondary processes Attention is paid to aspects that the individual is not yet aware of ("[[secondary processes]]"), and new possibilities are brought out by making them conscious and integrating them.
- Emphasis on physical symptoms and dreams Dreams and bodily sensations are viewed as expressions of psychological processes, and their meanings are explored to understand potential messages.
- We also deal with [[social contexts]], extending our approach not only to individual psychology, but also to interpersonal relationships, social issues, and conflicts, with the aim of promoting [[social transformation]] as well.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4.5/icon' alt='GPT-4.5.icon' height="19.5"/>That is correct. Process-oriented psychology (Mindel) and Eugene Gendlin's philosophy (especially "[[process of experience]]" and "[[focusing]]") have much in common.

## Common:
- [Both focus on the direct experience and sensation of the individual in the "here and now. The commonality is that they do not give priority to existing theories or frameworks, but rather follow the individual's internal process.

- [[focus on]] [[bodily sensations]] Mindel focuses on physical symptoms and sensations, and Gendlin also emphasizes "[felt sense" (the bodily sense of meaning before it becomes words). By focusing attention on the subtle sensations that are unspoken, we encourage latent understanding.

- [Both respect naturally occurring processes and insights rather than pre-determined objectives and conclusions. We believe that new meanings and possibilities emerge by following these processes.

## Difference (nuance difference):
- Gendlin's philosophy has a strong philosophical foundation and carefully follows the "[[meaning-making]] process" that occurs inside subjective experience.
- Mindel's process-oriented psychology, on the other hand, tends to be deployed more actively in social and group contexts (relationships and conflict resolution).

Both deeply resonate with the attitude of trying to promote new awareness by capturing the "human process" as it is a phenomenon.

You're right - there's a sense that Gendlin's is putting more weight on what happens within the individual.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
