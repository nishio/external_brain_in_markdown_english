- The question "[[requirement]] or [[sufficient condition]]?" is [[False dichotomy]].
- If a phenomenon is caused by multiple causes ANDonly, each cause is a necessary condition
- When a phenomenon is caused by multiple causes OR, each condition is a sufficient condition
- But real phenomena do not only occur in either of those patterns.
- If it occurs in `(A and B) or (C and D)`.
    - `(A and B)` is a sufficient condition for the phenomenon
    - A is a necessary condition for the satisfaction of `(A and B)`.
    - Is A a necessary condition for the phenomenon? Is it a sufficient condition?" is [[False dichotomy]].
        - Neither.
