title: "This itself is a real example."
---

I started using this phrase as a stimulus for [[Eugene Gendlin's]] [[instance of itself]] ([[IOFI]]). However, I am not sure if I understand the IOFI principle properly, and for now I just like the sound of the phrase.

- It's close in direction, but I think the details are falling into place in this representation.

For example, my book "[[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]" was produced by the intellectual production of engineers.
In the explanation of the chapter on abstraction, the process of "[[gathering concrete facts and then finding common patterns]]" is attempted to be accomplished by actually gathering concrete facts and then finding common patterns.
