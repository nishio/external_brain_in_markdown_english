title: 'Customer said, "I don''t need X."'
---

- 1: [[client]] is in a different environment than the proposer assumed and does not really need X
    - The assumption that "everyone needs X" is harmful and we should learn well about the proposer's environment
    - If it doesn't seem necessary after a thorough understanding, there's no point in forcing it.
- 2: Proposer does not understand the value of X
    - This one seems to be more common.
    - It is harmful to jump to these other-blind interpretations, so we should dare to consider one first.
    - It's hard to find value in something you haven't experienced.
        - Create opportunities for experience through some form of coercion.
        - The value of being used by someone you admire
    - Especially in the case of Scrapbox, I have a feeling that you won't feel the value until about 6 months to a year after you start using it.
        - The fact that there is now a fee for confidential use within a company is a headwind against this "creating opportunities for experience through coercion" pathway.
        - Even if you have a long trial period of six months or a year, it's a pretty tough situation because the fact that "I might be out of here in a year" chills the desire to write.
