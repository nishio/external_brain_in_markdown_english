title: "Consider the synonyms."
---

When you're thinking about a fuzzy concept, thinking about a synonym for that concept clarifies the boundaries of the concept.

- Some people hear the term "selective married couples" and for some reason focus only on the "married couples" part.
    - You misunderstand the axis of the debate.
    - To such people, the axis is clarified by showing them the counterpart between "selective and compulsory conjugal surnames".

- The concept of "multiple jobs" is not quite clear to me.
    - Single job vs. multiple jobs, "main job vs. side job," "dual job vs. full-time job."

- Concept of "comfort zone
        - [[Comfort zone and panic zone]]
