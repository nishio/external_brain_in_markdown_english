I thought it was a nice picture, then I thought about it in light of my own experience and thought, "Maybe it's a little different." I thought, "Maybe it's a little different.

What's different.
- I don't think my boss expects me to reach non-zero quality in zero time spent.
- Seems to be a different interpretation of the principle of occurrence of "consult earlier."
    - I think you're making a "misdirected effort."
    - To describe this, it is necessary that the quality for the worker is different from the quality for the supervisor (evaluator).

- 1: The worker thinks he has reached a good quality Q after a certain working time
- 2: But the quality is not good enough at all according to the evaluator's quality evaluation criteria.
- 3: Wrong direction
    - The operator's idea of quality Q1 and the evaluator's idea of quality Q2 are different.
    - If I had consulted with you earlier, I could have given you feedback that you were going in the wrong direction...
    - If you spend a lot of time preparing and then tell me I'm going in the wrong direction, you're wasting your time.
- This is the "consult earlier" composition.

Combine this with [the sweetness of the estimate
![image](https://gyazo.com/dbc51c43229ea523fc44f2c53a372682/thumb/1000)
- 1: For example, a report that is due in 4 weeks and you are asked to bring it to t3 one week before the due date for review.
    - Similar compositions vary in length from a 4 business day job, to a graduate study in 8 months, and so on.
    - If you set a deadline of four weeks, you usually expect to do it in four weeks.
- 2: However, workers who are lax in their estimates sometimes think, "If t3 is for review, I can make it if I work hard from t2.
- 3Left: I didn't make as much progress as I thought I would when I actually tried it.
    - I'm thinking, "Oh man, I'm not making as much progress as I thought I would, but if I keep going at this pace, I'll just barely meet the deadline."
- 3Right: However, since the quality evaluation axes are different, the evaluator's point of view is "You didn't do it at all! from the evaluator's point of view.
    - What the hell have you been doing for three weeks!"
        - I had done nothing for the previous two weeks.
    - If you can't do it, talk to me sooner."
        - The workers did not consult with him because they did not think he was incapable of doing so.
            - We have not even started.
            - But it's also late as the workers are aware, so they try to cover up the fact that they "hadn't started".
            - From the evaluator's point of view, it doesn't matter whether it was initiated or not, either way it's out because the results are not there.
        - And if you don't understand the discrepancy in the quality evaluation axes, you don't share the evaluator's feeling that "it's not done at all, it's hard to reach sufficient quality by the deadline.
            - He thinks that if he keeps going, he will make it.
    - How to proceed after this
        - Strong management case for quality on the Q2 scale
            - Q2 quality at the time of the deadline tends to be done in cases where the evaluator is also responsible
            - Tends to be an unhappy communication.
            - Workers believe that they are progressing at a pace that they can just barely make it on time.
            - The evaluator thinks, "I've spent three of the four weeks and brought about 20% of the required level to the review, it's not complete as it is."
                - Therefore, they try to somehow complete the work by giving gung-ho instructions, but from the worker's point of view, they appear to be "busy, but they give additional gung-ho instructions and get in the way of completing the work.
                - ![image](https://gyazo.com/70cef7663e1c5d893b3222de9ddf206a/thumb/1000)
                    - The worker wants to proceed to A, but the evaluator wants to proceed to B.
        - Cases of giving up
            - If the evaluator does not feel the need to work hard, he or she will give up, saying, "A person who has only reached 20% quality in three weeks will not be able to achieve good quality in the remaining one week.
            - There are gradations of giving up.
                - The messiest ones are the "hmmm, well, good luck" kind.
                    - No feedback.
                - The one that gives feedback on the wrong direction.
                - Tell only how to improve quality that can be done with minor modifications.
                - Related [[Evolution of output through review]].
- The Case for Thinking for Yourself
    - If you are asked what to do at the t0 or t1 stage, if you give instructions on what to do, you will train "people who cannot move without instructions" and you will likely be told to "think for yourself first"!
    - Even if the preliminary review is scheduled for t3, it is possible to consult with t2 early, and you may feel more comfortable.
