The Ethereum ecosystem can collect taxes and invest in public goods.

The real government taxes the buying and selling of land and goods. Real governments are taxing land and goods transactions, but Web2 wasn't able to do it; in the Ethereum ecosystem, we are doing a central bank move by making it burn, and we can turn it into an investment in public goods!
    - > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646391217499013120) I didn't know about the concept of burn, so I looked it up, and I see that some currency is removed from the market during transactions (I don't know how that amount is determined) Does this works like some sort of consumption tax? The difference is that unlike a consumption tax, the amount collected does not go to the government, but benefits all owners of the currency in the form of an increase in the value of the currency.
