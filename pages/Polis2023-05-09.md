- I did my best to write [/japol/how to make Polis](https://scrapbox.io/japol/how to make Polis).
    - I'm curious about the timing of the opinion distribution chart.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Maybe if enough more than 7 people vote.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Thanks for your time!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I'm trying to start Polis locally right now.
    - The first step in order to modify it is to start it up!

    - This is the first time I've tinkered with something designed to get Docker up and running, so I'm just going to have to see what I can do.
    - Motion!

    - I've got hello world for now, but I'm stopping Docker and --building again to reflect the update, which I don't think is the right development process.
    - The client side was React.

- When I answer [[Polis]], I want to say a lot of things, so I think it would create a different experience if it were combined with something like Scrapbox.
    - Not exactly what I meant by voting, but...
        - [[Hot Factories]] There's a sense of...
        - be known<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Reminds me of [[the car license exam]].
        - A is B
            - No, A is also C, so maybe No... and so on.
    - I would like to find out what topics you voted for UNSURE.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I hope the transition is seamless.

- If 1-polis-conversation is mapped to 1-scrapbox-project and 1-polis-comment to 1-scrapbox-page, there will be a page for each comment and it will be easy to write this and that.

    - In contrast, the image of ` [A is B]` page in scrapbox project X
