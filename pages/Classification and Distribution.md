It may be because humans in the past (and most humans still today) did not have the means to express what is essentially [[distribution]] in [[multidimensional]] space.
Even if the same data is [[hierarchical clustering]], different methods and metrics produce different [[(Christmas) trees]].

I thought, "[[liberal arts and sciences]] doesn't fit the term, natural history, Bacon classified it into natural history and natural philosophy, history, Kitaro Nishida classified the disciplines including history, Plato's classification, dialectics, physics, ethics," and so on.
