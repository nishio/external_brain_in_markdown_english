2022-04-25
- I have had many thoughts and discussions over the years of mentoring [[unexplored junior high school students]]. If the number of [[A third place to stimulate children's creativity]] like unexplored juniors increases in the future, there will naturally be more people who will be "mentoring for the first time. So it is beneficial for society to verbalize the experience and share it with them.

The mentors discussed whether the information sharing should be in the form of "public information dissemination" or "private two-way communication," and felt that the former would be a good place to start, so we decided to summarize the results on this page.
- (Nishio's original idea was the latter, but there is [[Difficulty in igniting SNS problem]]. It is better to start with a project that can be started by one person.)

What are "mitoujr-mentoring-tips"?
- Scrapbox project used to stock information among unexplored junior mentors since 2017
    - I use a combination of chat-like tools. In the past I used Slack and MS Teams, and now I use Mattermost.
    - I think the style of using chat together is good, as it is used with Slack even within Nota, a group of people who are familiar with Scrapbox.
- Records of a wide variety of events, discussions among mentors, TIPS, etc. are accumulated here.
    - but not content that can be published as is.
    - I would like to share information in a well-cut out or abstracted way.

Reminder: these are not "common views of mentors".
- Some articles are based on the opinions of several mentors, but it's "what Nishio personally thinks based on them.
- If you try to get it out after a common view, the throughput will go down.

What we're going to do
- Link to previously published articles
- We also want to publish unpublished tips.
    - but it's way overcapacity.
    - To begin with, I'm busy with this year's judging and need to get the Scrapbox project for creatives in place at the end of May.

- 2019-05-03  [[Should we write adoption criteria?]]
- 2019-05-10
    - I'm wondering what criteria should be adopted each year.
        - It is not obvious whether the strength of the relationship with the core business should be evaluated positively or negatively
    - I'm learning more and more each year as I accumulate more and more experiences.
        - This year's policy
            - Creator + PM" is a team
            - If you are a team, you must have the vision of all team members.
            - PM is not the team leader, but the chief creator is the team leader
            - So, shouldn't a PM choose the team he belongs to based on "whether or not he can [[empathize]] with the [[vision]] of the chief creator"?
                - [[Empathy with our vision]]
- 2022-04-25
    - Now I think the term "adoption criteria" is inappropriate.
        - Because we're not making decisions about acceptance or rejection based on verbalized rules.
        - It's a statement of values, of "what kind of things tend to be viewed positively."

    - [[Getting advice from parents is not a cheat.]]
    - However, he refuses to allow parents to be present during interviews.
        - In some cases, parents are off-screen.
            - It's not like the creators are answering the mentor's questions to the parent's face...
            - I would judge this kind of thing as not a spontaneous project.
