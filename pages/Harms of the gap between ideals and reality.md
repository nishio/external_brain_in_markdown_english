title: "Harms of the gap between ideals and reality"
---

- [[Gap between ideal and reality]] can be a driving force to make reality better, but it can also sometimes cause harm.
It would be good to be able to verbalize when there is harm.
    - [[Refuses to accept reality that differs from the ideal]]
    - This is a consideration for another time.
    - [[Struck by the gap between the ideal and the reality]]
    - There is a gap between the ideal image of what you should be and the reality of who you are.
        - This is not crazy.
    - At this time, the presence of a gap can generate damage to the psyche
        - [[MP]] will be cut off.
        - Why does this happen?
