[US OpenAI, CEO Altman to Leave, Effectively Dismissed - The Nikkei](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOGN1802J0Y3A111C2000000/)
> Open AI, the American venture company that developed ChatGPT, a generative AI, has announced that CEO Sam Altman is stepping down. The company's board of directors is not convinced of Altman's ability to lead the company, and the resignation is seen as a de facto dismissal.
If Sam Altman doesn't have the ability, who else does...

You say, "We've been communicating to the board without [[consistency]]," but if we've been consistent over the past year, isn't that evidence that we haven't been able to change [[to adapt to the situation]]`? That's how I feel.`
