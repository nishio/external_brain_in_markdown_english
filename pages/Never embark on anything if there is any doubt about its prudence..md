title: "Never embark on anything if there is any doubt about its prudence."

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Never embark on anything if there is any doubt about its prudence.
xci

- [[Suspicion of failure in the mind of the doer is evidence of failure in the mind of the bystander]], especially if he is a rival. Even if, while acting, you feel your judgment is in doubt, a sober reflection afterward will declare it folly. Acting without prudence is dangerous. Wisdom does not trust probability and always marches in the midday light of reason. There is no success in an undertaking whose judgment condemns it as soon as it is conceived. And if the resolutions passed by the inner court often have unfortunate results, what can we expect from what doubting reason and wavering judgment have undertaken?
