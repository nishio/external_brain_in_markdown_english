[Promises delay development - Mitsuyuki.Shiiba](https://bufferings.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/11/23/122815)
- If you are lucky, 1 month, if you are 60% confident that the task will be completed in 2 months.
- When asked [[estimate]] from outside the team, I can't answer something I'm 60% confident in.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who have not experienced the same manufacturing process will misinterpret [[Estimate dispersion]] as small.

            - Mr. A. "There's a 50% chance it will be over in two months."
            - Mr. B: "I see, so three months is 90% certain."
            - Mr. A: "No, it's not, if you need 90% certain [[commitment]], it's six months."
        - Related [[I thought the variances would be different.]] [[I thought the distribution shapes were different.]]
- Survey costs are high when trying to provide a 90% certainty estimate.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is par for the course.
        - The "possible causes of delay" are all investigated in advance to estimate how long the delay will be.
                - Contrary to [YAGNI Principles
            - [[risk aversion]] for which they are "pre-paying for something they may not need."
                - Same as [insurance
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The root cause is where A and B have different variance of estimates.
    - This in itself is not a bad thing, there are cases where a small estimate of variance is necessary.
    - If B is unaware of the size of the variance, he will seek a smaller variance even where the variance is larger and better, and will waste money on insurance.

However, such a story is based on the premise that the mindset of the person receiving the estimate must change (and that is often difficult to do...).

> [@natsutan](https://twitter.com/natsutan/status/1595592879896133632?s=46&t=eZ298FCcpjxAIF7-As9OvQ): @golden_lucky [[Waltz with a Bear]]. I remember now.
> The problem is that the estimate ends up being a promise and they are not willing to adjust the schedule afterwards.
> [@golden_lucky](https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1595593538191982592?s=46&t=eZ298FCcpjxAIF7-As9OvQ): @natsutan Further, after It's the air that makes it hard to approve schedule adjustments, or makes it seem like they might not be approved. Come to think of it, I think [[Deadline (Book)]] and others have a story like that.

> [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1595961650691321857?s=46&t=O_jA9WT4NsLFq7FH-lEsKQ): promises delay development - Scrapbox by NISHIO Hirokazu https ://t.co/n2gO0zSjGZ This is correct, so I will do a survey to see if I can achieve it within the time frame of the request I received beforehand. I'm taking the job like please give me money for the investigation period first.
- > [@voluntas](https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1595961871580147713?s=20&t=f1YxxnHj5Nt0M3GHDzHeWg): we will investigate if it is feasible in the time frame specified in the survey period, so we both have peace of mind. You will only have to deal with companies that can pay for the survey. It's a good thing.
