# purpose of this book
- I want a good reference book on [[intellectual production]]. I want a book that I can recommend to others when I teach them [[intellectual production]] techniques.
- I have been engaged in research on intellectual productivity at [[Cybozu]] for 10 years. As part of my work, I have conducted workshops at [[Kyoto University Summer Design School]] on how to organize and output ideas, and as a part-time lecturer at [[Tokyo Metropolitan University]], I have taught university students how to create new knowledge through research. I have also taught university students how to create new knowledge through research as a part-time lecturer at [[Tokyo Metropolitan University]]. However, it is difficult to convey what I want to say in a limited amount of time. If I introduce a lot of reference books, they will not read all of them. I would like to have a book that summarizes in one volume what I want to convey.
- But I don't have just one good book. If I could recommend just one book, it would be "[[way of thinking]]" by [[Jiro Kawakita]], but this is a book from 1966. The abstract ideas are still valid today, but the specific methodology is based on the technological standards of 50 years ago, and many people feel it is old-fashioned. We need a book for the next 50 years.
- If you don't have it, make it.
- I wrote "[[Technology Supporting Coding]]", a comparative study of programming languages, in 2013. The book is a long seller that is still being mentioned and sold five years after its release. No doubt some intellectual production went into the writing process. Then let me explain the methods used in the writing process so that others can use them.
- When writing "The Technology Behind Coding," I used a method based on Jiro Kawakita's [[KJ method]]. In the content of the book, I used the approach, "By [[Comparison]] of multiple programming languages, let's understand what parts change and what parts do not change," and "Programming languages were created by people, so they must have been created with some [Objective. Let's [[Focus on Purpose]]" approach. Now let's do the same thing for "intellectual production techniques" instead of "programming languages" - this is how the project for this book started.
