Why do we want diversity at all costs? Because the benefits of expanding the [[field of vision]] of an organization through diversity outweigh the costs. A horse in a race has an "eye pad" on its face that allows it to see only in front of it. When the objective is to run a certain course as fast as possible, they can concentrate better if they can't see their surroundings. However, it would be dangerous to go out into the field in that condition. Which is the current state of [[organization]]?

The strategy that worked best when you are trying to go the fastest on a given course toward a given goal is no guarantee that it will work best in other situations. Limiting your field of vision when you are roaming around in the field looking for the best grass can be counterproductive.
