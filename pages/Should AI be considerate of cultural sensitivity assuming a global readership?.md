title: "Should AI be considerate of cultural sensitivity assuming a global readership?"
---

It's unreasonable to demand from developing AI what even humans haven't mastered.

Social conflicts are opportunities for intercultural understanding. When the majority culture acts with 'cultural sensitivity', it ultimately deprives the opportunity to understand minority cultures.

It's good that Americans carelessly use mushroom cloud motifs to offend Japanese people, that Japanese export the anime 'Crayon Shin-chan', carelessly depicting a child's groin, and get it censored by the Thai government, and that Thai media carelessly post corpse photos in international news, inviting global disdain. Afterwards, forgiving each other would be beneficial.
