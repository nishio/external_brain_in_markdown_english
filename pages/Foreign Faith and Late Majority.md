title: "Foreign Faith and Late Majority"

> There was an opinion that Japan does not evaluate things unless they have been evaluated overseas, but in the case of human resources, people do not evaluate people within their own companies very highly, and they evaluate people who are highly evaluated in the external market. In other words, there is a big bias to undervalue familiar things, so it is necessary to increase the evaluation in the external market.
> This is, in essence, the late majority in [[chasm theory]] who are waiting for social proof because they are afraid or think it is not rational to take risks alone for something uncertain.
