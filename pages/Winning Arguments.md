title: "Winning Arguments"
---

Why does [[discussion]] with Mr. Tachikawa feel [[productive]]?

- We're not "arguing to win".
- If you think you're trying to win or get others to listen to you, you're not being productive.

Why is the argument for winning unproductive?

- Human language is rather tattered, so it is easy to poke holes in it if you want to.
- Trying to prevent that would be incredibly costly to defend.

- The [[productive discussion]] is focused on the amount of [[intellectual production]] per unit of time. Winning or losing is not important.
If both sides agree that "[[victory or defeat is not important]]," both sides may discard [[Cost of Defense]].
