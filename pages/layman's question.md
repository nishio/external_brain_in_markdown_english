title: "layman's question"

> [ode4phys](https://twitter.com/ode4phys/status/1756904138200453509) I spoke to a student who remained in the lab the evening after submitting his graduation thesis about the so-called "layman's question".

>  That is usually a real layman's question, so there is no need to fear that in and of itself. What we should fear is that we will not be able to kill a layman's question that we should be able to kill instantly, and that [[lack of preparation]] will become obvious.

In a thesis, there are many faculty members who belong to different societies.

>  The matter I posted this time was meant to talk about the fact that in a Q&A session for a thesis or master's thesis, a professor [[with a different field of expertise]] may ask questions because he/she [[misunderstands the terminology]] or doesn't know the fundamentals....

- [[terminology]]
- [[misunderstanding]]
