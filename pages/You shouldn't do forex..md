title: "You shouldn't do forex."
---

If people tell you not to do [[FX]] and you don't do it, don't do it.
People who are told they should do FX should not do it either.
Neither of them has the [[preparedness]] to take on the [[liability]] of their [[decision-making]] on their own.

        - Whether you avoid it because you're told it's [[Dangerous Roads]] or you go in because you're told it's not [[hazardous]], neither one of these ways of life is for you.
        - So only those who can judge for themselves the level of danger can do that.

- [[self-responsibility]]
