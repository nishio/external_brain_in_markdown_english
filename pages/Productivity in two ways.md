title: "Productivity in two ways"
---

> Those who measure "[[productivity]]" in terms of "[[production per unit time]]," which has nothing to do with human beings, force people to work long hours to increase productivity, while those who measure it in terms of "[[production per unit labor hour]]," which is the human standard, believe that long working hours reduce productivity and that people should take proper rest. People who measure productivity by "[[production per unit labor hour]]" think that people should take proper rest because long working hours reduce productivity.
