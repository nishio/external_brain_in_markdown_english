### Summary of notes
.
We consider dependent phenomena with statistical variation in terms of the most efficient plants going out of business.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Scientific Management Method" emphasizes maximizing efficiency and productivity. This is related to the subject of the note, the perspective that "the most efficient factories fail". The fragments "State of ineffectiveness for effort" and "Diary 2023-06-01" are also related to the discussion of efficiency and productivity.

### deep thinking
While maximizing efficiency and productivity may seem like an idealistic goal, it is important to take the perspective that it does not always lead to success. The fact that even the most efficient plant can fail if statistical variability and dependent phenomena are not taken into account offers a new perspective on business strategy and production management.
