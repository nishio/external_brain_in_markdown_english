title: "Vision at the Core and Observable Projects Are Not the Same"
---

[[Vision]] at the [[core]] and [[externally]] [[exposed]] and [[observable]] [[projects]] are not [[equal]].

- A: A project is undertaken because it is effective in advancing towards the vision.
- B: Advancing towards a vision seems to create long-term value, but I want to move forward instead of staying there, so I build a place for those who want to gain value.
- C: Participating in a project is beneficial in the short term for advancing towards my vision.
    - Although less efficient than A, there is synergy with other participants and existing resources compared to creating a project from scratch, so it is often [[faster than doing it alone]].
    - However, since the visions do not align, it is certain to part ways in the long term.
        - There is no such thing as "[[visions aligning]]", so it is "[[aligned]]".

- At [[Social Hack Day #64]], there was a discussion about "You used to do book clubs, right?"
    - Indeed, there are people who stick with the same project for years and people like me who change frequently.
    - I believe projects are meant to be completed, and I think the completion timing is the end of the day, so I don't feel the need to do the same thing at the next Social Hack Day.
    - I recognize the [[civic tech]] community as a [[community as a bundle of projects]], and I believe [[projects are fuel for progress]], and since they are [[fuel]], it's natural for them to burn out.
