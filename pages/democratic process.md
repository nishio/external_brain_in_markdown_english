title: "democratic process"
---

Definition by OpenAI
> What do we mean by a “democratic process”?
>  By “democratic process,” we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people(A) exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions,(B) and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.(C) There are many ways such a process could be structured—we encourage applicants to be innovative, building off known methodologies, and coming up with wholly new approaches. Examples of creative approaches that inspire us include Wikipedia, Twitter Community Notes, DemocracyNext, Platform Assemblies, MetaGov, RadicalxChange, People Powered, Collective Response Systems, and pol.is. Another notable ongoing effort is led by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), with whom we are partnering on public input to AI, contributing to their upcoming Alignment Assemblies. We also encourage applicants to envision how AI could enhance the democratic process. For example, AI could enable more efficient communication among numerous people.  --- [[Democratic Inputs to AI]]
- (DeepL) What is the "democratic process"?
    - (A) a broadly representative group of people exchanging views and engaging in thoughtful discussion; and (B) a broadly representative group of people exchanging views and engaging in thoughtful discussion,
    - (B) Through a transparent decision-making process
    - (c) It means the process that ultimately determines the outcome.

- > A: How one selects the group of participants is a critical design question. Part of this grant challenge lies in determining questions about participation. For instance, policy questions involving minority groups may require an increased representation of group members, while questions about the impact of technology on children might necessitate the involvement of domain experts such as educators and psychologists. Moreover, certain questions might be better suited for responses from populations within specific geographical boundaries in order to address localized policy issues.

For example, policy questions involving minority groups may require increased representation of group members, while questions about the impact of technology on children may require the involvement of domain experts such as educators and psychologists. In addition, some questions may be better suited to be answered by groups within certain geographic boundaries to address regional policy issues.
- > B: Deliberation can be described as a process that uncovers opinions, helping the discussants understand each other's views and reconsider and update their viewpoints. Well-designed deliberation ensures that arguments are well understood by all sides, and are based on people's values rather than superficial misunderstandings. Successful deliberation results in participants reaching a higher level of consensus, and/or reaching deeper levels of understanding for differing perspectives.
        - [[careful deliberation]] could be described as a process for unearthing opinions, for debaters to understand each other's views, and for reconsidering and updating their own viewpoints. A well-designed deliberation ensures that the discussion is well understood by all sides and is based on people's values, not superficial misunderstandings. Successful deliberations allow participants to reach a higher level of consensus or a deeper understanding of different perspectives.
- > C: There are many decision-making algorithms to be considered here, such as electing representatives, majority voting, employing liquid democracy, and making decisions by a random population sample, also known as a jury or sortition.
    - There are many decision-making algorithms considered here, including the selection of representatives, majority rule, the adoption of liquid democracy, and decision-making by a random population sample, also known as jury or selection.

- > For those who can find no group to which they belong, [[representative democracy]] is nothing more than a deception. When people who feel they are not represented and their voices are nowhere to be heard emerge in large numbers, they abandon [[parliamentary democracy]] and rather look for a strong leader to guide them.
- What needs to be resolved for "those who feel they are not represented and that their voices are not heard anywhere."
    - In other words, "[[to]] feel that [[one's]] voice is being heard."
        - [[my voice]]
    - from [[can agree to disagree head-on]].
        - > No changes were made, but those who insisted on changes were also satisfied
        - > because their values were recognized and actions were implemented based on them.

- [[Plurality and Polis Study Group]]
- > Modern Japanese democracy is an indirect democracy in which "first we elect representatives, and then those representatives make decisions.
- > Audrey Tan pokes at it, "That's too little bandwidth, isn't it, just the way it was to achieve democracy in an age without digital technology, and digital natives are not happy with that slow upload speed!"
    - The [[upload speed]] of [[my voice]] is important.

- > There is a growing sentiment within ourselves that rejects the "system of equal individual participation and responsibility" itself. Whether we express our opinions or not, whether we debate or not, the answer is fixed. Then it is enough if someone else decides for us. I think this is the greatest enemy and threat to democracy.
    - [[Giving up]]
        - [[sense of helplessness]]
    - A sense that they are not being heard when they express their opinions.
        - From the opposite perspective, if you throw a misguided opinion at me [[not based on the premises]], I'm not supposed to listen to it.
        - [[needs to learn before throwing an opinion]], but he doesn't understand that [[he hasn't learned enough]].
        - Why not visualize the lack of learning and ask, "Do you want to learn or leave the decision to those who have learned?"
        - [[Sharing of prerequisite knowledge]]
- > Historically, [[democracy]] and [[parliamentarism]] were originally two different things. At least until the 18th century, there was a clear distinction between [[democratic system]], which is direct rule by citizens, and [[republicanism]], which is decision-making by elected representatives
