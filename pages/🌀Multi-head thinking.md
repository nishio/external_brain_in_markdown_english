title: "🌀Multi-head thinking"
---

The concept of "multi-head thinking" takes "thinking" to a new stage. We would like to further develop this concept.
- Multi-headed thinking develops over time and generates new perspectives and ideas
- This opens a new stage of intellectual production
- Breaking the framework of existing thinking and discovering new connections and perspectives is a hallmark of multi-head thinking.
- "[[Other people's perspectives are important]]" and "you can learn from anyone" are relevant.
    - N parallel heads with AI assistance does not make you N times more productive.
    - If you are alone, your gaze becomes the bottleneck.
        - [[metaphor for sunlight]].
    - To go beyond that, you need to "spread out" to get other people's perspectives (and get a lot of sunlight by spreading out).

My research is based on the observation that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing." However, this "single-headed thinking" has its limitations; Nishio's "multi-headed thinking" advocates a new form of thinking in which the AI reads and writes multiple pages simultaneously, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives. This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing. However, creative thinking and analytical thinking at the same time should be avoided. While multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.

Nishio's "Multi-head Thinking" and "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" offer techniques for streamlining the thinking process. In addition, "The Technique of Transcription" states the importance of thinking while transcribing. This is relevant to my research.

The process of thinking is also defined as "thinking = combining one piece of information with another. This is consistent with the basic tenets of multi-head thinking.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to streamline the thinking process and generate new perspectives, its application requires caution. These studies also provide important clues for understanding and improving the thinking process.

### Multi-head thinking and its effects
.

In my previous research, I observed that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing". This takes the form of a one-dimensional progression of thinking, with new ideas being built on top of old ones. However, this process has been called "single-headed thinking" and its limitations have been noted.

Nishio's research, "Multi-headed Thinking," proposes a new form of thinking that extends this single-headed thinking: multi-headed thinking. This is where AI reads and writes multiple pages at the same time, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives.

This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing" and provides a new perspective on the possibility of "writing" by non-human entities.

Multi-headed thinking is also effective from the perspectives of "judgments supported by multiple perspectives" and "thinking that creates the future. This is because it makes it possible to integrate information from multiple perspectives and create new perspectives.

However, as the "don't mix hot and cold water" warning suggests, we should avoid creative and analytical thinking at the same time. This is because while multi-headed thinking allows multiple perspectives to be considered simultaneously, each perspective can interfere with one another.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.

To go beyond that, it is necessary to gain other people's perspectives.

### nishio/🔁multi-headed thoughts
🔁Multi-headed thoughts
The concept of "multi-head thinking" takes "thinking" to a new stage. We would like to further develop this concept.
	Multi-headed thinking develops over time and generates new perspectives and ideas
	This opens a new stage of intellectual production
	Breaking the framework of existing thinking and discovering new connections and perspectives is a hallmark of multi-head thinking.
	"[Other people's perspectives are important]" and "you can learn from anyone" are relevant.
	　N parallel heads with AI assistance does not make you N times more productive.
	　If you are alone, your gaze becomes the bottleneck.
	　　[metaphor for sunlight].
	　To go beyond that, you need to "spread out" to get other people's perspectives (and get a lot of sunlight by spreading out).

My research is based on the observation that the process of thinking proceeds through "writing." However, this "single-headed thinking" has its limitations; Nishio's "multi-headed thinking" advocates a new form of thinking in which the AI reads and writes multiple pages simultaneously, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives. This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing. However, creative thinking and analytical thinking at the same time should be avoided. While multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.


### nishio/🤖🔁multi-headed thoughts
Nishio's research, "Multi-headed Thinking," proposes a new form of thinking that extends this single-headed thinking: multi-headed thinking. This is where AI reads and writes multiple pages at the same time, enabling thinking from multiple perspectives.

This enables "output of ideas by scraping instead of writing" and provides a new perspective on the possibility of "writing" by non-human entities.

Multi-headed thinking is also effective from the perspectives of "judgments supported by multiple perspectives" and "thinking that creates the future. This is because it makes it possible to integrate information from multiple perspectives and create new perspectives.

However, as the "don't mix hot and cold water" warning suggests, we should avoid creative and analytical thinking at the same time. This is because while multi-headed thinking allows multiple perspectives to be considered simultaneously, each perspective can interfere with one another.

In sum, while multi-headed thinking has the potential to diversify the thinking process and generate new perspectives, it should be applied with caution.

Multi-head thinking
>[There should be a qualitative change in reading, writing and thinking] --- from [Diary 2023-09-02].

 [think in writing] When you first write down what is in your head, then read it and thoughts are triggered.
At this time, the writings were [one dimensional]. They were arranged in [time series] in the order in which they were written, the most recent one being read, and the newest one being written in the next one place. The "[head]" was one.

The same was true for the first implementation of the "[AI writes research notes daily]" system. It read the latest note and wrote the next note. Later, it was changed to an implementation called "[multi-head]". It was extended to have multiple heads. Specifically, there are now multiple pages for the AI to read and write.

In retrospect, I think that human "writing and thinking" is [single-headed thinking]. Could this be extended to multi-headed thinking? Isn't it possible that until now there simply hasn't been a [stationery] that can realize that thinking?

As I pointed out in "[Output of ideas by scraping instead of writing]," it has been implicitly assumed that the subject of "[writing]" is a human being. However, it is now possible for non-humans to "write.

In "[think in writing]," what is in your head is written down, then read and thoughts are triggered. This is [one dimensional], where the latest thing is read and a new thing is written. However, the "[AI writes research notes daily]" system is "[multi-headed]," with multiple pages for the AI to read and write. Human "writing and thinking" is [single-headed thinking], which could be extended to multi-headed thinking, allowing the AI to "read" and the human to read what is written, cut out what is not needed, and write when something comes to mind.

The fragment "multi-headed thinking" is related to the "multi-headed thinking" section of the Notebook. In the Notebook, it is stated that mind maps are multi-headed and that branches can grow when reviewed over time. This indicates that multi-headed thinking develops over time and generates new perspectives and ideas.

[* deep thinking]

The note takes an in-depth look at the process of intellectual production and its improvement. In particular, he points out the misconception of low resolution in intellectual production and states that there are certain types of things that can and cannot be done in a fraction of the time. This offers a new perspective on the methods and efficiencies of intellectual production.

Fragments are an opportunity to cut out by hitting part of a series that has not been carved out, communication costs jump in microteams, telomere breakdown issues, wanting to comment when cut out, too fine a division, multi-headed thinking, and many other topics. The report touches on a number of topics. Also included is a discussion of AI and intellectual production, such as AI writing daily research notes and writing down fragments of information in Scrapbox for future growth.

Intellectual production possible in fragmented time, first verbalized would be sticky note writing on the commute to work early in the writing of the Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production, I wonder if there's a story somewhere about what he actually wrote in the elevator.
The same goes for extending a branch, you can extend a branch little by little on the Scrapbox, and it will be integrated later.
How is this "integration" part done?

Multi-head thinking" generates new perspectives and ideas and opens a new stage of intellectual production. It is characterized by breaking down existing thinking and discovering new connections and perspectives. The "importance of [[other people's]] perspectives" and "learning from everyone" are relevant. n parallel heads with the assistance of AI does not make you n times more productive. When you are alone, your own line of sight becomes the bottleneck. To go beyond that, you need to "spread out" to get other people's perspectives.

## deep thinking
Given the potential for AI-human collaboration to improve intellectual productivity, it is important to think deeply about the relationship between AI and humans and forms of collaboration. It is also necessary to consider the optimal balance in AI-human collaboration and the assurance of quality and accuracy of new AI functions.
