title: "User stories and implementation do not match"
---

- The story from the customer's perspective, "This is a system that brings this kind of value to you," does not match the "what the system does" in the implementation.
    - The [[user story]] must be expressed in the language of the customer's domain
    - [[user story]] and [[mounting]] do not match
