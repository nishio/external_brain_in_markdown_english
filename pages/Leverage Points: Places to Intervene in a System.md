> PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM
>  (in increasing order of effectiveness)
>
>  12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).
>  11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
>  10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
>  9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
>  8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
>  7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
>  6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
>  5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
>  4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
>  3. The goals of the system.
>  2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
>  1. The power to transcend paradigms.

>  6. the structure of information flows (who gets information and who does not).
>  5. system rules (incentives, punishments, constraints, etc.).
>  4. the ability to add to, change, evolve, or self-organize the structure of the system.
>  3. Goals of the system
>  2. the idea or paradigm from which the system (its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters) emerges.
