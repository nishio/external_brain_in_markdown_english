- Over 4 million East German citizens fled to the West in 1949-61, gaining freedom of life and thought.
- Just before the construction of [[the Berlin Wall]] in August 1961, 2,400 people a day crossed the border; after the Wall, the number dropped sharply.
- → There are situations where "move before the boundary closes" is the optimal survival solution.


- [[boundary]] [[moves]] [[before closing]].

Enter before [door closes
    - [[There is no guarantee that the door that is open now will remain open in the future.]]
