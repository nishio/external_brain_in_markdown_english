- Note that I unusually did not fall into a deep sleep upon falling asleep.
- And when I showed it to my wife, she couldn't tell the difference because she'd never seen one in "good condition" to begin with.
        - [[Sleep Memo Typical Pattern]]
- Too hot for a blanket to wear?
    - When I woke up, I knew it was hot.
    - That would have been just fine since it had been below freezing for a while, but was it warm yesterday?
- Numbness on the surface of the right thigh or a tingling sensation when blood flows after the numbness
- Dehydrated from the warmth of the wearable blanket and the hot carpet?

- Stress?
    - It is true that today is the real day of what I have been [[PAST Past Question Practice 202012]] doing for a while now.
    - Do you wake up early because of stress or pre-field trip excitement?
        - I don't know if it's that big of a deal. It doesn't feel right.

- Not sleepy right after waking up.
- I've only slept for 5 hours and 43 minutes, and up until now I've decided that it's my day off and I should go back to sleep, but forcing myself to sleep from here on out hasn't made much of an improvement, so I'm up.
- Once I woke up, after a while, I felt sleepy.
    - Has taking off the blanket you wear lowered your body temperature?
    - Should I have taken my temperature before taking it off?
- At 8 o'clock, the morning sun shines into the house and it's bright.
- Maybe it was the lack of daylight due to the fact that the sleep phase has been receding and it's now 2:00-10:00.
    - Come to think of it, yesterday I watched [[Phototherapy Light]] in the morning and then turned it on at its lowest setting until about 5:00 p.m.

- Looking back, I'm not sleeping well every Saturday, I don't know why.
