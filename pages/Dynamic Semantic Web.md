title: "Dynamic Semantic Web"
---

from  [[Namera Conference 2]]

miyabi:
- Semantic Web of Knowledge, Semantic Web in 3 dimensions
    - When you create a hierarchy or classification, you thereby fix the context to a single object.
    - In the Scrapbox domain, it's called the "[[dead text]]" problem.
        - Similarly, there would be a "[[dead IP]]" problem.
    - [[Knowledge needs to be stored on the network]].
        - [[MEMEX]]
- GPT
    - Make the document more fine-grained rather than stand-alone.
    - Then we could curate more.
    - 「 [[Evergreen notes should be atomic.]] 」を連想した<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

ken:
- knowledge graph
    - LLMs move from static to dynamic graphs.
    - Network changes depending on context
    - Meaning-making becomes dynamic.
    - Information that "when A becomes possible, B becomes possible."
        - A number of elements are updated by the input that A is now possible, following the network
        - Dynamic Semantic Web

Discord:
- [[sowawa]]>  I sometimes think about the semantic web again when I think about AI too.
    - Or rather, a reminder.
- Ikumi Akatsuka> Dynamic Semantic Web
- YukiJP> What is Semantic Web?
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
    - [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/セマンティック](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/セマンティック) and Web
- sowawa> Like a dynamic RAG.
- nishio> Since humans can't see the entire web anyway, why not render only the "surroundings" and generate only the nearby areas while moving around?
    - Image like an auto-generated dungeon game.
    - miyabi> It's like a stream that curates and generates useful context within a certain perspective.
    - sowawa> That's a filter bubble,,
        - (PS) If only similar things are connected, it will be a filter bubble, but if you treat it as [[Conflict is a close relationship]], it will be a system that encourages [[Cumulative effect of ideas]] by presenting links to things that are in conflict with your current position. I guess.

(Supplemental)
- nishio: is @miyabi the first person to say this? I'd like to record my contribution as the person who started it.
- miyabi: I think the statement itself is mine.
    - Originally, [/miyabi-00000/Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/miyabi-00000/Scrapbox), the idea was put together in [/miyabi-00000/Knowledge Scalability](https://scrapbox.io/miyabi-00000/Knowledge Scalability). In addition, the extension to Semantic Web and memex was developed in the project with my current team @yugo and @reira! Thanks!
- ryoar: as you said, I remember that @miyabi's comment led to [Jamesy's](https://twitter.com/nothinglezz) expanding on it and connecting it to @kensuzuki's discussion of dynamic networks.
    - I think it would be fun to express it graphically in 3D.
