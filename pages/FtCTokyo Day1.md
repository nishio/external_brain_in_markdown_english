> [homata](https://x.com/homata/status/1815950000805093405) If social systems or laws are an obstacle to your new idea, you can consult the regulatory sandbox system of the Cabinet Secretariat. You can consult the possibility of doing this from the demonstration level.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815946744548790618) Regulatory sandbox system, created in 2018. Regulators can't reform regulations without data, operators can't experiment and get data if there are regulations. Sandboxes allow us to "try first" and "formulate policy through demonstration and dialogue with the market" #FtCTokyo
- Q: Difference from special zones
    - Not that the law doesn't apply in the Tsukuba Robotics Special Zone.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815943777712050629) A future where algorithms are searched and used by AI will come, then returns should be made to those who publish good algorithms to the marketplace, researchers have DID, Researchers should have DID, issue VC when uploading, and mediate the value of use with tokens #FtCTokyo

- Moving on because this is quite disturbing.
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815953179688780021) Social Common Capital forms a network, and is converted into value through the network (value chain) Apply [[ constraint theory]] and solve the problem of under-use of public goods by eliminating bottlenecks #FtCTokyo
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815955665774600546) This was a very thought provoking presentation. In order to achieve effective altruism, we have to take the system as a whole and identify the bottlenecks and donate

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815956235780493571) Some people do unadopted juniors and are blessed with a good family environment, others are not. I think that's another opportunity to experience diversity, so I shouldn't be tainted by a particular adoption pattern, but as for the part controlled by my discretion, "what's the bottleneck in the system?" I may have to be aware of this.

> [fwatanabe](https://x.com/fwatanabe/status/1816095231965815202) Funding the Commons, is an awesome conference. It is very dense. I talked about social common capital, theory of constraints, and donations.


## lunch break
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815966958602576227) I didn't understand there was a lunch box.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1815969166828134873) I didn't understand that there was a lunch box, so I said, "I bought it and brought it because I didn't want to walk around in the heat, there's a convenience store there, why don't you just get it?" I was told to go into the Mexican restaurant next door -> @tokoroten
- The person who said "I bought and brought it" chose Weider In Jelly and Calorie Mate, which can be preserved in case of surplus, so no damage, only tokoroten lost, sorry!
- Result (16:53)

>  I am wondering if we can create new value by using AI to explore a large amount of possibilities for patent discovery and business creation exactly. Let's talk again.
> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1815980918915641347) Nowadays IP is supposed to be commercialized by the person who invents it.

> [mamisada](https://x.com/mamisada/status/1816000788923310189) I know I spoke too fast and crammed in a lot of things I wanted to say, but I was trying to convey something from an assortment of examples of what could be done by crossing Civic Tech and Citizen Science. I hope you got the message...

> [mamisada](https://x.com/mamisada/status/1816376294000775200) This is what I talked about in Day 1 of #FtCTokyo about the fusion of civic tech and citizen science and the creation of infrastructure for it. I think this is an area where we haven't had breakthroughs yet, but we can do it if we all think about it together... Please let me know what you think by replying to this post [[Science, technology, and Citizenship - Speaker Deck https:// speakerdeck.com/mamisada/science-technology-and-citizenship]]

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1816010940988678391) I like the idea of broad listening, where offensive comments are filtered out in the preliminary stage, but this is adjacent to the loss of social rights for people with aggression. However, this is adjacent to a society where aggressive people lose their social rights.

- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1816061047050232016) Don't worry, the fairy on your shoulder will be able to translate it into beautiful words (Shinichi Hoshi).

> [leopom10](https://x.com/leopom10/status/1816011209403162764) I see, broad listening can achieve a departure from hierarchy.

> [leopom10](https://x.com/leopom10/status/1816013814913196202) #FtCTokyo
>  Will organizations that have lost their hierarchy scale?
>  Or will they be free to stick together and part ways?

> [leopom10](https://x.com/leopom10/status/1816016941384921342) Exchange style -> FtC -> Plurality (Web3) connection is too vivid.

I was supposed to watch the rest of the session, but there were questions about my session and stuff, so I moved on and answered them and forgot all about it.

# Afterparty

Plurality's worldview is that the world is made up of [[intersecting groups]]," "[[Plurality here]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]], [[Plurality now]]. Plurality], literally [[here and now]]" #FtCTokyo
