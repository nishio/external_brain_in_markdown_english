        - I saw him as an iron man (he has a will of steel and can use his [[meditation]] guns to get back to normalcy quickly if necessary) who almost never, if not never, disturbs his mental tone.

    - >  Any tool must be learned how to use, otherwise it cannot be used well and will not create value.
    - I didn't have to use the word "suck at it."
    - I don't usually talk this way.
        - [[strong language]], which has had strong repercussions on Twitter, and not good.

    - Strong words on social networking sites get strong words back.
        - piss in the wind
- After the earthquake, there were engineers who got excited about using their engineering skills for the benefit of society! I think it's really great that there were engineers who got excited and said, "I'm going to use my engineering skills for the good of society!

- I wonder if there was a page that said something like, "You shouldn't connect with an unspecified number of people in the world when you're mentally weak."
    - We don't share context with an unspecified number of people in the world.
    - So there is an additional cost to communication.
    - When the mind is tired, this cost payment is heavy.
    - If you get tired and act messy, and then it gets boosted by unexpected interpretations, you start a bad loop, where your mind gets tired again and it costs you to explain yourself.
    - So we have to leave before it gets worse.
    - Might there be a demand for an AI with guaranteed acceptance for tired people?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - I had put that log on Scrapbox.
    - This is a pile of "my answers to your questions" data!

    - I'm doing a psych test on GPT3, interesting.
- I want Scrapbox to have a "vector search by articles written in the last 24 hours and sorted in order of similarity" top page.
