Chapter of the White Bone
> The "White Bone Chapter" was written by [[Rennyo Shonin]] (1415-1499), who was active in the Muromachi period (1336-1573). Rennyo Shonin was the one who accurately conveyed [[Shinran Shonin's]] teachings to many people, and there is no one better than Rennyo Shonin in that respect to this day.... The "White Bone Chapter" is often read at funerals of [[Jodo Shinshu (offshoot of the Jodo sect)]] because, as the name "White Bone" implies, it describes the solemn reality that all who are born must die.

- [[Rennyo]] / [Shinran (third highest of the eight hereditary titles)
> As I look at the life of mankind, I realize that it is a transitory existence, like a phantom, from the beginning to the end of this world. Then, we have not yet heard of a person who has received a universal life. A lifetime can easily pass. Who should keep the form of a hundred years? I or others, today or tomorrow, those who are late or ahead of us, are more vulnerable than the dewdrop of a book or the dew of the last drop of dew.
>  Then, in the morning you will have a red face, but in the evening you will be as white as a bone. When the winds of impermanence have already come, when the two eyes immediately close, and the breath of the one is gone, when the crimson face has turned to a vain smile, and the garb of the peach and plum is gone, the six relatives will gather to mourn and lament, but it will not be worth it.
>  But, as it was not to be, I sent him out into the open, and when the smoke had cleared away by midnight, nothing remained but his white bones. I am sorry, but I am also a fool.
>  Then, since the fragility of human beings is a matter of indefinite age and youth, we should all be mindful of the most important matters of our later lives and deeply revere Amida Buddha and pray to him.
