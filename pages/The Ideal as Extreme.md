title: "The Ideal as Extreme"
---

- Even if [[ideal]] as [[limit]] is [[unattainable]], it has nothing to do with the usefulness of [[improvement]] toward the ideal [[achievement]].
[[Harmful perfectionism]] is the belief that "if you can't achieve it, then activities to achieve it are futile."

Mathematical Representation
- Let x be the larger of the two.
- The "act of adding +1 to x" makes x larger.
- No matter how much +1 you do, you will never reach "infinity" as the limit of magnitude.
- That doesn't make the "act of +1 to x" futile.

Is it realistically possible to "[[not]] take all opinions
- All opinions can be "[[received]]" but there is too much information to input into the individual.
- Summarization and visualization cannot realistically achieve "[[not]] all opinions [[are]] dropped" because some data will be discarded.
- However, the advantage of clusters is that you can direct your attention to more detailed clusters, whereas when you look at live opinions on social networking sites, your view is filled with the top two or three opinions in a cluster, and minor opinions are buried.
- It is difficult to achieve the ideal of "not taking in all opinions," but it is realistically possible to move in the direction of improving "[[picking up more opinions]]" toward that ideal.
    - [[Technical assistance to ensure that the opinions of a large number of people are taken into account as much as possible]]

# Blind Spot Card Candidate

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In Plato's "[[theory of ideas]]," [[idea (in Platonic thought)]] as an ideal form cannot actually be attained, but the pursuit of that ideal is meaningful. Similarly, in Aristotle's "[[virtue ethics]]," the practice or improvement of virtue itself is important, although it is difficult to attain perfect virtue.

relevance
- "[[Obvious Criticisms]]" for "[[Reality has not reached the ideal]]."
