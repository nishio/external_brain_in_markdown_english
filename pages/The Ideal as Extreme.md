title: "The Ideal as Extreme"
---

- Even if [[ideal]] as [[limit]] is [[unattainable]], it has nothing to do with the usefulness of [[improvement]] toward the ideal [[achievement]].
[[Harmful perfectionism]] is the belief that "if you can't achieve it, then activities to achieve it are futile."

Mathematical Representation
- Let x be the larger of the two.
- The "act of adding +1 to x" makes x larger.
- No matter how much +1 you do, you will never reach "infinity" as the limit of magnitude.
- That doesn't make the "act of +1 to x" futile.

Is it realistically possible to "not take all opinions off the table"?
- All opinions can be "received" but there is too much information to input into the individual
- Summarization and visualization throw out some data, so "not all opinions are taken down" is not realistically feasible
- However, the advantage of clusters is that you can direct your attention to more detailed clusters, whereas when you look at live opinions on social networking sites, the top two or three clusters fill up your view and minor opinions are buried.
- It is difficult to achieve the ideal of "not taking in all opinions," but it is realistically possible to move in the direction of "picking up more opinions" to improve toward that ideal.
    - [[Technical assistance to ensure that the opinions of a large number of people are taken into account as much as possible]]
