title: "No editing unless explicitly in edit mode."
---

- User's voice: "I was just going to watch it, but I accidentally edited it."
- Now "Move Sticky" mode by default
- But maybe a mode of just moving screens would be better.
- If the viewing and editing modes are explicitly separated, problems with co-editing are less likely to occur.
- On the other hand, might it raise the bar for writing?
    - Much better than a whiteboard?
