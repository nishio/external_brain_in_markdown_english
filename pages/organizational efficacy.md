title: "organizational efficacy"
---

- Extension of the concept of [[self-efficacy]] with respect to [[individual]] to [organization
    - Sense that [[teamwork]] is working

If you have self-efficacy and no organizational efficacy, "I can do it, but I can't do it in this organization, [[change of occupation]]".
