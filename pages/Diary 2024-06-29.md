> [mattie_s3](https://x.com/mattie_s3/status/1424959370433994752) I would love to hear a conversation between Prof. Miyadai and Audrey Tan.
>  The answer to what Professor Miyadai calls the inferiority, the [[structural cynicism]], the [[surmise (about somebody's feelings)]], and other bugs in democracy is a system of "[[listening closely]]" where politics in Taiwan's digital democracy picks up the voice of the people. I wonder if this is not the case.
>  How about incorporating it into Japan? Including transparency.

> [Fugeshi](https://x.com/Fugeshi/status/1797444393269666111) A sticker I got at a recent demonstration in Tainan. It says "I'm not particularly passionate about politics. How can you be so indifferent?"

> [rootsy](https://x.com/rootsy/status/1797444393269666111) This sticker shows that the Blue Bird Movement, formerly known as the Sunflower Student Movement, and Taiwan, which has had cabinet ministers like Audrey Tang, is still a political movement that has to shake off the apathy and cynicism of the people, There are a lot of apathetic and cynical people out there, and we have to shake off their "what are you doing? Good luck.

> [izumi_akashi](https://x.com/izumi_akashi/status/1806900367449567497) "NY Times editorial board asks Biden to pull out of the race," the Japanese media should at least ask Japan's "old-fashioned politicians" to pull out of the race. How about the Japanese media at least asking the Japanese "old-fashioned politicians" to withdraw from the news? If the media continues to report news that is so discreet to those in power, the old media itself will be abandoned by the public and asked to withdraw....

> [miyasaka](https://x.com/miyasaka/status/1807023572541731163) It's been five years since I started working for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Please come into this world where you have a lot to lose but also a lot to gain. Please consider the option of using part of your long professional life as a full commitment to the public good.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807033941305721217) "It's not about the loss of money, it's not about career advancement, it's about knowing that there is work in this world that someone must do now (in my case, government digitization) and that I can contribute They say there is something I can do. /There is a huge amount of satisfaction here."

[Takahiro Yasuno's AITuber "AI Anno" Technical Commentary Article Published on RAG Utilization & Double-Checking Halcination Measures, etc. - ITmedia AI+ [https://www.itmedia.co.jp/aiplus/articles/2406/28/news199.](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/aiplus/articles/2406/28/news199.) html]]


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806790586009309432) I watched the scene where Mr. Anno negotiates with Mr. Shimizu to join him on live TV, and Mr. Shimizu responds that he is willing to do so if they can come to an agreement on disaster prevention and other policies. I am amazed that he had the gall to negotiate this on live TV.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806462705475494329) I watched all of this and recommend it because it was interesting. The interviewer was a smart person who had studied well in advance, so the discussion was interesting and dense without being scattered. Mr. Yasuno spoke in a sympathetic manner, saying that "in business management, you can't avoid the muddy stuff," so I guess he is a manager.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806793026301517977) "Support from older people is stronger than expected, and the argument of enriching the country with technology is supported by people in their 80s. Ah, I see, this was a blind spot. 70 year olds experienced the period of rapid economic growth.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806845796144271572) As you can see from some of the comments on this video, it is directly communicated to people in their 70s and draws positive feedback. I hope positive word of mouth spreads from these people to others their age around them.

This could be used not only for elections but also for administrative services. It is true that residents can't do a lot of research on their own, so this could be useful.

I've never had any practical experience, but I'm working on it. He has no practical experience, but his speed and leadership are amazing.

>  When I hear episodes of utilizing human networks in various regions outside of the country, I am convinced that so much high-quality output is being produced. The way they proceed with trial and error in a short period of time while involving citizens is synonymous with a new political system already in motion.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806879164043342092) This time he is doing his best on the stage of the Tokyo gubernatorial election, but the social movement that #Takahiro Yasuno is taking leadership in is not only about the Tokyo metropolitan government, but also about creating a mechanism that will ripple throughout politics here and there in Japan in the future. I thought again that the social movement that Mr. Takahiro Yasuno is leading is not only about the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, but also about creating a system that will have a ripple effect on politics everywhere in Japan.

The system he created this time to build the will of the people, such as AI An-no (YouTube, phone support) where AI answers policy questions, will be made open and available for Tokyo politics & for other candidates to use next time. We don't want to be closed! Accessibility mindset important!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806877536628142492) "It is not good if you cannot assert what you want to assert, for example, if you only want to get elected, it would be more beneficial to join a national political party and follow the party's policies. That would mean giving up your independent position where you can freely say what you think and feel without any strings attached. The same goes for hairstyles. The atmosphere that judges others by their appearance and forces them to change their appearance should be changed." #Takahiro Yasuno

The only candidates whose tweets I could find were Takahiro Yasuno and Renho, who wrote ALT in the image.
> [ymrl](https://x.com/ymrl/status/1807069518105362797) Neither of them, both camps, have a thorough operation of writing alternative text for images, and there are some things that tend to get left out, especially when they are out on the street, and some things that I would have written more like this. However, from what both he and his office are doing, I sense that they are doing it with the intention of guaranteeing information.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
