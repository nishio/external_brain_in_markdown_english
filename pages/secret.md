reason
- Stakeholder Convenience
- Not yet solidified.
    - The type that breaks if shared before it hardens.
    - The kind that changes quickly when shared before it hardens.
        - This is an opportunity for "change makers" and "creators" to participate
        - For those who only receive the money, they say, "Give it to me when it's solidified.
        - Difference between notifying the client of an update to a draft and notifying the client when it is completed.
                - [[The good thing about esa]]
    - [[Ungated, profitable venues are razed.]]
