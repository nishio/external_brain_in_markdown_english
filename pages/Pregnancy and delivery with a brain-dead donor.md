The author proposes a new method (WBGD: Whole body gestational donation) in which "a [[donor]] in a brain-dead state [[is]] used for [[pregnancy]] and [[delivery]]. Similar to the framework of organ donation, this method maintains bodily functions by artificial respiration, etc. after the determination of brain death, and "donates" the uterus and reproductive functions to continue the pregnancy. According to existing literature, there are cases in which pregnant women who have been declared brain dead due to accidents and other causes have been managed to prolong their lives until delivery, so it is technically feasible.

What is the aim of the proposal?
- (1) Eliminate the need to impose the risks and burdens of pregnancy on conscious women,
- (2) The same level of ethical and legal integrity as normal organ donation can be maintained (if brain death is accepted as the standard for organ donation, continued pregnancy is also theoretically possible),
- (3) Theoretically, even the male body can become fertile, alleviating the concern that only the female body is "containerized".
However, many issues remain, including long-term life extension management, procedural agreements, and ethical issues during the research and experimental phases. The author nevertheless concludes that "this method deserves consideration if existing organ donation and reproductive medicine are allowed.

The article only presents the theoretical possibility that it may be possible to establish a pregnancy even in a brain-dead male. Specifically, a fertilized egg is implanted in the liver or other area with abundant blood flow (a type of intraperitoneal pregnancy), and hormones are administered to maintain the growth of the fetus. The idea is that the fetus is extracted through a surgical procedure equivalent to a cesarean section. The theory is that implantation in the male body would normally be extremely dangerous, but with a brain-dead donor, the "risk of fatality to the donor" would not be an issue. However, this is a theoretical proposal, and in practice, many technical and ethical issues remain.

Still at the "this is a possibility" level.
- In science fiction movies, when depicting "[[artificial wombs]]", it is often portrayed as if the fetus is floating in a transparent glass-like environment for the sake of visual effect.
- I'm sure that's what you mean when you say, "Why not use a human being?" among many other options, such as using a pig's uterus.
- There's something sci-fi about the narrative that "brain dead is dead, so it's okay to do things that risk death."
- Realistically, I'm not sure which is better, having a child with the liver of a brain-dead man or having a child with a cloned man whose brain was prevented from forming in the first place.
