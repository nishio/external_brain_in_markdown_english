It indicates a causal relationship in which one condition or event causes another to exist. This principle is based on the idea that all phenomena arise from causes and conditions, and that without those causes and conditions, there would be no phenomena associated with them.

For example, a specific example is that the existence of life causes aging and death. Without life, aging and death are said not to exist. Thus, "[[If there is this, then there is that]]" explains that certain outcomes occur only under certain conditions, while "[[If there is not this, then there is not that]]" indicates the opposite relationship.

The law of karma is a Buddhist teaching that shows the way to understand the causes of suffering and to find ways to overcome it. This is supposed to open the way to overcoming suffering and eventually to [[nirvana]] ([[moksha]]).

This expression is found in the Avatamska sutra, which states, "Because this is, therefore he is; because this happens, therefore he happens; because this is not, therefore he is not; and because this perishes, therefore he perishes. This indicates the interdependence of events, as one event causes another event to occur because of its existence.
