- Write a string on Scrapbox that a human can see and say, "This is an instruction for ScrapboxReader.
- The child elements of the bullet points could be parameters, comments for humans, or place a link to ScrapboxReader
- On the ScrapboxReader side, Scrapbox data is received via API and rendered.
    - At this point, see if there is a string that indicates how to render the image, and if so, select the rendering method accordingly.
- You can't edit in ScrapboxReader itself, but if there's always a link to the original Scrapbox page in an obvious location, it's not much different from "click the edit button to edit" and you can get used to it.
- Compared to the type of customization that "if you put in UserScript, only the person who put in the UserScript can use it".
    - Hassle since the original Scrapbox rendering results cannot be used
    - Easier to implement for some things since it does not depend on the original Scrapbox rendering results
        - Fragility
    - Easy to show people what you have made and say, "I made something like this.
