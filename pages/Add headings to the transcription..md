title: "Add headings to the transcription."
---

- [[Kinta Nakayama]], who looked at [[Tachikawa-san Communication Theory]], pointed out that "if [[headline]] is added at the right time," and I thought that was true.

It would be good to think of each line of speech as a sticky note for the [[KJ method]].
Gather related items and headings.

Would it be nice to be able to import the transcription results into the [[Electronic KJ method tool]]?
