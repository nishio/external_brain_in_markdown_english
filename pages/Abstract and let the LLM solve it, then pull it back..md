> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1696430020510757066) Well, I was reading the math guidelines and I found a very good diagram, so I'm just quoting it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1696444859148820960) I don't think this cycle is PDCA or SECI, but I wonder if it has a name.
> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1696446049710424349) In case you're wondering, this is what it says in the math [[teaching guidelines]], but it doesn't have a name!

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1696461588075807067) It's hard to use because it's hard to understand the meaning, but I think "[[cycle diagram of mathematical activities]]" is close to the official name, just in case.

> [kawahiii](https://twitter.com/kawahiii/status/1696489551102095481) Good to hear!
>  The original was probably first published in [WG #2 on January 22, 2016](https://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chukyo/chukyo3/073/siryo/1366539.htm), so it looks like it was refined from there and became the final guideline form. It seems to have been refined from here to the final form of the Courses of Study.

digression
> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1696431565235200012) I wrote a book like this
>  In case you're wondering, there is a column in the book called "ChatGPT, Abstract and Concrete," and it talks about it in text, but it didn't make such a nice diagram.
>  That was a waste of time.
>   [[ChatGPT Strategy]]
> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1696432081319133229) The column in question contains sentences like this.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1696433863965417485) By the way, in the column in question, when I wrote "The reason why Todai students are excellent is not only because they are excellent, but also because their friends are also excellent", it was edited out. I wrote "The reason why Todai students are excellent is not only because they are excellent, but also because their friends are also excellent.
