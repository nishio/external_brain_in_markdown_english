I want to reuse it on other maps.
- Stickies added while working on an individual map can be reused on other maps.
    - Not sure if that should involve a "screen where all stickies are visible".
        - Need to be creative in the way it is presented.
        - It would be a hodgepodge map of all genres.
    - Proposal to display in search and recommendation when working on another project.
