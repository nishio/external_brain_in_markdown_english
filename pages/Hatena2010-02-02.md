*1265111140* [kaizen (Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement)] Rice cooking
I haven't cooked rice in months.

Cooking one cup of rice took 46 minutes today. It may be partly because the water is cold, but it seems to be taking quite a long time.

After cooking rice, if you eat as much as you want and try to freeze the rest, you end up eating the whole cup and overeat. Or you end up with a delicate amount that is really just a bite. Instead of eating analogously, first divide the rice into freezer containers and eat it digitally. 1 cup turns out to be the equivalent of two freezer containers of rice.

This algorithm, which distributes the rice into storage containers before eating, reduces the risk of forgetting the rice in the cooker and having a big problem a week later. I have been told, "You can just divide the rice and freeze it right away," and I used to think, "But if I put it in the freezer without removing the rough heat, it will damage other things," but if I divide the rice and leave it, the rough heat is removed by the time I finish eating it.
