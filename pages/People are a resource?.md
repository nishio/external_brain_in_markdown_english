title: "People are a resource?"
---

Note that the discussion about whether people are resources was interesting.
- People are a resource
- Treating people as resources is treating people as objects.
- If it is a resource, it is not a thing.
- People who create value are a resource.
- He should be aware that he's a resource.
- It's because you're not a resource, because you're not a resource, because you're not a resource, because you're not a resource.
- Because of their low value as a resource, they feel they are devalued when they are interpreted as a resource
