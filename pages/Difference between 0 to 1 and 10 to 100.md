Difference between [[0→1]] and [10→100

[TOKYO Foundations Station - Entrepreneurship](https://startup-station.jp/m2/services/sogyokassei-incu/report/20210624-2/)
- > I feel that when you start something new, hardship always follows. For example, when we switched from [[entrusted development]] to a business that utilizes our own products, there were various waves. In the case of entrusted development, the client has already validated the business model, so the kind of work that turns 10 into 100 is useful.
- > On the other hand, in the business of our own products, we are required to work to turn 0 into 1. No one can guarantee that the business will become 1, and even if you do your best to create it, it doesn't necessarily mean that users will pay for it. It took me some time to understand the difference between a job that turns 10 into 100 and a job that turns 0 into 1. I think some employees were also confused by the change in work methods.
