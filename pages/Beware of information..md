Beware of information.

Be careful to be informed.
lxxx

We live by information, not sight. We exist by trust in others. The ear is the gateway to truth, but the front door to lies. Truth is generally seen, but seldom heard. Truth seldom comes in a pure state, especially when it comes from afar. Passion dyes her with its colors wherever it touches her, sometimes favorably, sometimes vice versa. She always elicits a temperament, so receive carefully from those who praise her and more carefully from those who condemn her. You should pay attention to the speaker's intentions and know in advance what position he will come from. Reflect on falsehoods and exaggerations.
