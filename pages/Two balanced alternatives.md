title: "Two balanced alternatives"
---

When one chooses one of the two options from the state of being torn between two balanced options and not knowing which one is better, it sets in motion the "stopped and stagnant flow" and the other option is decided.

Once in the "[[Stopped state]]", the dynamics of the state will continue.

There were two questions: "whether to rebuild it or not" and "whether it should be a casual collaborative editing for one person or a rigid collaborative editing that can withstand use by multiple people.

However, it's not as if I'm falling on the side of "don't do anything," and I'm choosing to "stop using Canvas," which wasn't on the table of consideration until I decided to rebuild.
