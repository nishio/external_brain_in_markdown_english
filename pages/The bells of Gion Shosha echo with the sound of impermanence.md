title: "The bells of Gion Shosha echo with the sound of impermanence"
---

> The sound of the bell of Gion Seisakusha echoes the impermanence of all things. The color of the flowers on the sal tree shows that all things must come to an end. The proud are not long in coming, but it is like a dream on a spring night. The fierce will soon perish, just like the dust before the wind.

This passage is the opening section of the Japanese medieval literature "[[The Tale of the Heike]]," a very famous text that symbolizes the Buddhist view of impermanence. Its explanation to English-speaking people is as follows.

1. overall overview
This passage expresses the transience of life and the rise and fall of the world. Influenced by Buddhist thought, the passage reflects the aesthetic and value systems of Japanese culture, particularly the underlying theme of impermanence. Here, the inevitability of prosperity and decline, as well as human arrogance and the ephemeral nature of power, are emphasized.

2. points of interpretation

The bells of Gion Seisakusha echo with the sound of impermanence.
[Gion Seisaksa is a famous Buddhist monastery, and the sound of its bell symbolizes "Shogyo Mujo," or the fact that everything keeps changing and is not eternal. This part of the temple suggests the inevitability of change in life and in the world.

The color of the flowers on the sal tree shows that prosperity is inevitable.
[The sarasouju is a sacred tree in Buddhism, and the fleeting beauty of its flowers symbolizes the law of "sic transit gloria mundi," or "that which flourishes must also decline. The transitions of the natural world are superimposed on the fate of human flourishing.

"Not long has the proud been as the dream of a spring night."
It is a metaphor that even those who are arrogant and powerful do not last long, and their glory fades away like a fleeting dream on a spring night. It is also related to the Buddhist teaching that one should let go of attachment.

"The fierce will perish in their own time, just as the dust before the wind."
It states that even the mighty are ultimately doomed to perish, and their existence is as powerless as [[dust in the wind]]. This part symbolizes that in a world of impermanence, power and might are also meaningless.

3. cultural background
This passage symbolizes the theme of "The Tale of the Heike," which tells of the prosperity of the Heike clan and its tragic downfall. In particular, the Buddhist teachings of "all things are impermanent" and "moribundity is inevitable" are deeply rooted in the aesthetic sense and worldview of the Japanese people. This philosophy emphasizes an attitude of acceptance that all things are fleeting and temporary, and the importance of letting go of attachment.

4. assistance in understanding in English
The main point of this passage is that it describes through poetic and symbolic expressions the universal truth that "all glory and power will surely come to an end." In particular, the Buddhist view of impermanence presents a different value system from Christian culture, emphasizing the beauty and transience of transition rather than eternity.
