# Definition of Wise People and "Simplified Explanation"
![image](https://gyazo.com/fad712916bfd3911830c30fed78a3511/thumb/1000)

- The saying "wise people can explain clearly" has an ambiguous meaning of "wise."
- "People who understand a concept well" can explain it by making the steps smaller.
    - This is known as [[simplified explanation]].
    - 2025-02-06
        - In 2019, it was written as "can," but as of 2025, this is doubtful.
            - Even [[people who can ride a bicycle]] may not be able to "[[explain]]" how to ride it verbally.
            - "Listening to explanations" is only one part of the means of acquiring knowledge.
        - It's rather [[the reverse is true]].
            - "People who do not understand a concept well" cannot [[delve into]] detailed explanations.
            - Just because someone understands doesn't mean they can explain.
- Smaller steps make it less likely to stumble.
    - However, the size of the steps and the number of steps to reach the destination are inversely proportional.
        - The more simplified the explanation, the more time is required.

- Here, "wise people" refers not only to those with abundant knowledge but also to individuals who deeply understand a concept and can think logically.
- In other words, "people who understand a concept well" can provide explanations divided into fine steps (small steps), known as a [[simplified explanation]].
- In this step-by-step explanation, the load (step) of each step is reduced, making it less likely for the listener to stumble at each step.
- However, making the steps smaller increases the number of steps to reach the destination (ultimate understanding), resulting in a trade-off where the overall time and effort for the explanation increase.

# Oversights of Those Who Understand
- "People who understand a concept well," like person A, often overlook certain things.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/91e4a15f0c4d5fe24a6734237f5abddf/thumb/1000)
- Person A tends to think that if the steps are small, anyone can climb them.
    - Since they could climb them, they assume others can too.
    - However, many people do not have that level of perseverance.
- Person A', who realizes this, tends to say, "If you lack perseverance, climbing is impossible."

- Person A, who understands a concept well, tends to assume that "if the steps are small, anyone can climb them," based on their own experience of understanding through small steps.
- In other words, they assume that because they understood, others can also persevere in the same way. However, in reality, people's perseverance and learning environments vary, and many may not be able to secure the necessary perseverance or time.
- Person A', who realizes this, tends to say, "Without perseverance, climbing itself is impossible," but there is also a problem here.
    - Person A' also overlooks something.

# Misunderstanding Learners' Needs
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b5712eb89a3071716e48299889304d12/thumb/1000)
- Person A' assumes that "Person B wants flag X."
    - Therefore, they think it's impossible to obtain it with just four steps.
    - But is this correct?
- Even if Person B, who doesn't understand X well, says "I want X," it doesn't mean it literally.
    - What Person B truly wants or desires has a range.
    - The optimal goal changes based on the balance between this range and the time cost Person B can afford.
    - Person B', aiming for Y, was able to reach a "satisfactory result" in the same time as Person B.
- To teach correctly, it's necessary to know what Person B wants, to what extent, and how much time they can spend.

- Person A' assumes that Person B is aiming for a specific goal, "flag X," and judges that it's impossible to reach that goal with small steps like four steps.
- However, when Person B says "I want X," it doesn't necessarily mean a literal, specific "X," and Person B's true desires have a wide range of possibilities.
    - It often differs from "Person A's idea of X." <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Moreover, the optimal goal and means of achievement change based on the balance with the time and effort (time cost) Person B can invest.
- In reality, Person B', aiming for Y, sometimes finds a way to achieve a sufficiently satisfactory result in the same time as Person B.
- To instruct correctly, it's necessary to fully understand what Person B wants, to what extent, and how much time and effort they can allocate beforehand.

# Challenges in Knowledge Exchange Among Adults
- Person B also overlooks something.
    - In most cases, Person A does not have the intention to spend a lot of time preparing the optimal teaching method for Person B individually.
        - To maximize Person B's benefit, it's optimal for Person A to learn about Person B and present the path to Y.
        - Such a time-consuming task is rarely done unless there is a significant relationship.
    - Unlike the "teacher and student" relationship in schools, in adult relationships, Person B must first be recognized by Person A as "worth spending time teaching."

- In most cases, Person A does not have the willingness to spend a significant amount of time preparing an optimal explanation method from scratch for Person B individually.
- Ideally, to maximize Person B's benefit, Person A should understand Person B's character and learning style and present the optimal path to Y, but in reality, such effort is rarely made.
- This indicates the reality that, unlike the clear framework of "teacher and student" in education, in knowledge exchange among adults, Person B must first be recognized by Person A as "worth teaching."
