2024-05-14
- We received anonymized data for 110,000 people from [[JAPAN CHOICE]]'s [2022 Upper House Election Voting Navi](https://japanchoice.jp/vote-navi/) and conducted a cluster analysis.
- 14 one-hot questions were encoded into a 110,000x74 dimensional [[voting matrix]], [[Polisian Analysis]] with the algorithm of [[Polis]], divided into 5 clusters, and the explanations of the clusters were created by GPT4

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Below are the appropriate group names based on the different groups' responses to the Japanese political questions:
- Group 0: Progressive Reformers
    - This group strongly opposes security legislation, including the right to collective self-defense, takes a position of not appreciating Abenomics, and supports an immediate phase-out of nuclear power. The group also opposes the relocation of the U.S. military base in Okinawa to Henoko, Nago City, and opposes the revision of Article 9 of the Constitution. These positions demonstrate a progressive and reformist approach that values fidelity to the Constitution and is cautious about military and nuclear policies.
- Group 1: Conservative Guardians
    - Members of this group generally support security legislation that strengthens Japan's defense capabilities, appreciate Abenomics, support the relocation of U.S. military bases in Okinawa, and support amending the Constitution to clearly state the Self Defense Forces. They also support the promotion of tourism policies, including casinos, and are conservative, defense-oriented, and focused on economic growth.
- Group 2: Cautious Moderates
    - This group is somewhat more moderate in its support for Abenomics and security legislation than Group 1, supporting initiatives such as casinos and base relocation, but cautious about fiscal policies such as tax increases. They have a balanced view that weighs potential benefits and social impacts.
- Group 3: Indifferent Skeptics
    - They appear to be skeptical or difficult to make decisions on major issues, with noticeably neutral reactions on nuclear electric policy, and are not positive about major changes or strong opinions. This may reflect an attitude of indifference or low engagement.
- Group 4: Critical observers
    - This group is highly critical of current policies such as Abenomics and security legislation and resists the relocation of U.S. military bases. Their critical stance on key economic and defense policies and their deep observation and skepticism of government actions are evident.

These labels are intended to capture the general trends and sentiments of each group based on their voting patterns and responses to key policy questions in Japan.
