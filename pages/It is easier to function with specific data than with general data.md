title: "It is easier to function with specific data than with general data"
---

Where it is facilitated by AI, it is written (AI).

- Parameter settings that work with specific data
    - Parameters can be specific.
    - It was hard for humans to change the parameters and test them.
        - (AI) AI automatically sets up the system and can look at the results and say, "Do this more like this.
- Parameterizable design that works with general data
    - Need to be able to change parameters
    - Users need to be able to think about how to make changes
        - (AI) AI will tell you how to change it.
- Design to automatically set parameters that work with general data
    - Need to be able to change parameters
    - How to change it needs to be implemented by code.
        - (AI) Implementation of how to change is done by AI.
