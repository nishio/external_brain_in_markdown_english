[[Lost and found]] is [[as good as none]].

The concept of "[[It's as if there's nothing you can't take out when you need it...]]" educated by [[wife]] since around 2009 went too far, and the moment I left my glasses somewhere and they went missing in 2023, I felt that "the glasses [[no longer exist in this world]]. The moment I left my glasses somewhere and they went missing in 2023, I felt that "they [[no longer exist]]" and [[wife]] asked me "did you inquire about them?" I really thought to myself, "Why? I really wondered "Why?

In addition, when I sent an inquiry e-mail, I immediately received a reply saying that the glasses were available, so it seems that the glasses still existed in this world.

On the day I went to collect it, I went for a foot massage, and when I told this story, the therapist said, "I would have given up right away, but that's great!" he said.
