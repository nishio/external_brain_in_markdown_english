title: "tolerance for anxiety"
---

I found the term "### anxiety tolerance
" interesting, so I looked up how it's used.
- Similar concept to my use of [[risk tolerance]]?
- The term "anxiety tolerance" seems to be perceived by some people as being limited to a mindset thing.

> If you build an organization with people with low anxiety tolerance, [[official announcement by the shogunate (or a daimyo, etc.) that the government will step down from its post to the Emperor]], you will have no choice but to manage. If you build an organization with people with low anxiety tolerance, you have no choice but to manage it with [[official announcement by the shogunate (or a daimyo, etc.) that the government will step down from its post to the Emperor]].
>  So, there are about 60% of people who have a low tolerance for anxiety in their experience, so if you get people together to form an organization in the usual way, you will need a big headquarters.
>  So we have to pay up-to-date attention to recruitment and organization.
- >  according to Martin Seligman.
- >  MetLife created a team of people with [[optimistic]] explanatory styles, and they outperformed the rest of the sales team by 57 percent.
- >  I heard that if you narrowed down your hiring criteria to whether your explanatory style is optimistic or not, your market share increased by almost 50 percent.

>  and the information doesn't come down to those with low anxiety tolerance.
>  Because when they try to do something new, they feel insecure about the level of things in the plan and become dissatisfied, or they leak information in an attempt to relieve their own insecurity.
>  So, people with low anxiety tolerance are informationally isolated and controlled by the main government.

> I wonder if people with low anxiety tolerance are the so-called "[I don't want to apologize, so I ask permission. I don't know.
- > I don't know if this is a different topic from people with low anxiety tolerance, but I sometimes think that "[[permit]]" in "[[Don't ask permission, apologize.]]" and "[[(Edo period) counter for hundreds of mon ((obsolete unit of currency)]]" in "If you are going to act, you should be reasonable" are exactly the same thing. I think there are sometimes people who recognize that "(Edo period) counter for hundreds of mon ((obsolete unit of currency)]" and "If you are going to act, you should be reasonable" are exactly the same thing. There can be a situation where you ask for a permit but not for a reason, so they are two different things.
- > "I'm going to do something like this, and I might get in trouble, so I'll apologize first" would be "making sense," but asking for permission would be transformed into "I might get in trouble, so give me permission, and the last thing I want is to get in trouble. But if you ask for permission, it becomes "Give us permission because we may cause trouble," which is "not reasonable.

> Even if we advocate "zero risk is impossible, think in terms of trade-offs," I have recently been thinking that it would be impossible to spread this message to the majority of Japanese people. This is not limited to the Japanese, but the chain of low self-assurance, low anxiety tolerance, and zero-risk orientation is inevitable in human psychology. And Japanese people's self-esteem is always low.

> Well, however, Japanese society is strongly structured in such a way that individuals are raised from an early age to have a low tolerance for anxiety, and [[anxiety]] such as "I am different from others" is used as a tool to control individuals and maintain society, and while this makes society more efficient, it also causes a lot of unhappiness. I think it causes a lot of unhappiness.

> Of course I believe that "this world is not [[fairness]], and good deeds are not always rewarded and evil deeds are not always punished. But even in such an unjust world, I dare of my own will to reject evil deeds and do good deeds.
> My view is that the [[just world hypothesis]] was acquired by mankind in the course of evolution to alleviate to some extent the problem of "human beings are usually weak-willed and have low anxiety tolerance," and that mankind has not yet reached the point where it can discard this.
