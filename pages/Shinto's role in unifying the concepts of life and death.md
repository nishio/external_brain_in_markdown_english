The role of Shinto in unifying the concepts of life and death can be seen in relation to the fragment of How to Send Students to War. It is possible that the Shinto view of life and death influenced the idea of introducing a new "[[one's o]]" in which students could "[[Live forever]]" by dying for "[[eternal cause]]".

[The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to attain union with the "eternal, infinite, and absolute existence" and thereby "transcend the world of birth and death. This is the thought of Dushun, the founder of the Kegon sect, which was organized by the fourth patriarch Cheng Kuan, who added the "circumstance" of the lost world to the four categories.

In terms of beliefs, the Sokushin Seibutsu philosophy has been adopted. Sokushin Seibutsu is the idea that it is possible to attain enlightenment in this life in this body. However, [[enlightenment]] is not a dichotomy between "attained" and "not attained," but rather, the path of seeking enlightenment must continue until death.

- [[The process of thinking about what "thinking" means]] breaks the stalemate of thinking by trying to find a connection to the current situation by considering it to be an [[oracle]]. This is "thinking about duality," specifically, "mapping to the space of duality and thinking there.

- [To live is to create." Creation is to bring disparate and heterogeneous things together in a meaningful way, to bring order to them. Man is the creative agent, and to live is to create an orderly flow in chaos.
