title: "About the Do-It-Yourself Intellectual Production Program"
---

I noticed that there was no "[[Self-intellectual production program]]" as an extension of the current exported chat system and asked for advice on how to create one.
summary
- Chatbots are working on the side of humans and are less likely to be autonomous.
    - I like the feeling of a human being going to see it occasionally as it moves on its own at a greater distance.
    - Specifically, Twitter bots.
- Wise words bot as a first step in "worthwhile output."
    - Intellectual production is the creation of "information fragments that have been cut into the size of a tweet and made easy to distribute.
- [[program for intellectual production without humans]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wish I could be more clear about my own intellectual production program.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "clarification" is this "clarification"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We know what to implement and how to implement it. Right now we don't know, so we are first creating a program that will help human intellectual production and increase intellectual production as a whole, but there is no program that will produce intellectual production without humans as an extension of this program. We need a different approach.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Input information on its own, without human manipulation, and output new and useful knowledge that did not yet exist in the world.

- >  I know what to implement and how to implement it. Right now we don't know, so we are first creating a program that helps humans to increase their intellectual production in total, but there is no program that will produce intellectual production without humans as an extension of this program. We need a different approach.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, there are two programs coming up, but let's talk about the more obvious former one. This program is invoked by a human and takes as input what the human writes. It then outputs a question statement. We can judge whether this questionnaire is useful or not based on whether or not it prompted the human receiving it to notice it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "program" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Runs 24 hours a day on a server

- How do you know about this "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I made this up because when I went to study coaching techniques, I was told that coaches should be careful not to interpret their clients' statements without their permission, and I thought that computers are inherently better at that than humans.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "human being" is this "human being"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Human coaching. I have also tried human coaching and found the method itself to be very beneficial. However, it is expensive, and while a chat can return the text as it is typed, a voice coachee may fail to catch or unintentionally ignore the expertise of the coachee because the coachee does not have it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At this point, I don't know how a program can create value without humans, so I am focusing on creating value as a set with humans. However, I would like to create a program that can create value without me before I die. I can't move toward completion without advancing my consideration of how to create that. Let's see, so to summarize, I see value in getting an idea that will take me one step forward toward creating a program that can produce intellectually and create value without humans.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "program" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>As for where they are, the current system is closely exchanging information on the human side, but the new system is working on its own at a more remote location. For example, they have their own Twitter account and send out information on their own, and I go to see them from time to time.

- What does this "program" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So it's in the form of a chatbot that responds to what humans say, so it's reduced to a subordinate object to humans, and you don't see a future where it becomes an independent, autonomous program. It's like a fixed-point camera in a zoo that shows what is active in the absence of humans.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that "program"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The program is primarily autonomous, but the resulting product should be of value to humans
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "program" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We need to be able to output something that people would find valuable.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the "program," can it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>One possibility is a quote bot, the common one simply outputs the original data, and you can use this as a generative model, or you can give it a larger article, and it will cut out a tweet-sized piece from it and tweet it with the source (I made the latter once in a hackathon). In either case, "fragments that have been cut out to the size of a tweet and are easy to distribute" are generated, and the number of reactions will tell you how much value people find in them.

- Where does this "program" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I left it alone after the hackathon, but I'll dig it out and see what kind of code it is.
