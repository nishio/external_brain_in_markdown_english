[What an engineer and science fiction writer learned from experimenting with GPT-4 writing support to see if it could be used in a real-world situation｜Anno Takahiro｜note](https://note.com/takahiroanno/n/n4036a09eb15a)
- Great article sharing what didn't work.

> [@awakia](https://twitter.com/awakia/status/1644573111822745601?s=20): I'm developing a ChatGPT Plugin and it's an interesting world. The only thing that changes the behavior is the "description" part.
> What we're making: transcribing up to 5 minutes of audio/video URLs
> Image 1: The one where the error message when the video length exceeds 5 minutes returns the internal API specification.
> Image 2:...

> [@hiro_gamo](https://twitter.com/hiro_gamo/status/1644377379291410432?s=20): I couldn't believe the fact that "GPT-4 was announced only 3 weeks ago" and had to look it up again. It was for real.
> It feels like it's been about 3 months...my sense of time has been destroyed since I took a position promoting ChatGPT. It's moving too fast.
> Oh, so that means I'm aging at 1/4 the rate you are?
> That's awesome, ChatGPT.
> I'm tired, I'm going to bed ChatGPT.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644545607133204481?s=20): that can't be true, it's halucination! (no, it's not)
> But even my realization was a few months ago.
> I'm hearing from several different channels that it feels like n months turned into n weeks, so I guess we all feel that way.

> [@taisukeOo](https://twitter.com/taisukeOo/status/1644611205041094656?s=20): if I had time to think about the difference between AI and humans, I would co-evolve with AI and be impressed by the new intelligence and physics I encounter.
> I don't see the point in considering differences since they are mutually variable to begin with.

- [[What cannot be explained is important.]]

> [kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1644532644196253698) This is the first thing that programmers need to realize is that when they think "I want to make something like this," the work time is overwhelmingly reduced and the barrier of "I want to make it but I need an unfamiliar language or an unknown framework. I want to make something like this, but I want to make it in an unfamiliar language or with an unknown framework.
> [kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1644607812293775360) I wrote a story about how that would also eliminate the front-end and back-end barriers.
>  >kis: With ChatGPT, the barriers between front-end and back-end are almost nonexistent, and everyone is a full-stack engineer! This is a summary of what I've been saying.

> [shimesaba_type0](https://twitter.com/shimesaba_type0/status/1644536090127376385) It is no longer AI assisted development!
> [kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1644536339105472512) What you want to do can be done right away!
> [inuro](https://twitter.com/inuro/status/1644554611527921667) quite this.
>  >kis: I think the first step in this is for programmers to realize that the work time when they want to create something like this has been drastically reduced, and the barrier of "I want to create something but it requires an unfamiliar language or an unknown framework" has disappeared.
> [inuro](https://twitter.com/inuro/status/1644562280800219136) So, now is the best time to make something with the Kinugasa that my old man ripped off. vanilla JS+ I'm a member of the jQuery generation, so this is exactly right for me.


> [kumagi](https://twitter.com/kumagi/status/1644613391586299905/photo/1) I like the way they shut down these places in a matter of seconds to prevent people from starting to argue that "ChatAI should be given the human right to live" or something like that. I like the fact that they seem to be preventing the emergence of people who will start claiming "ChatAI should be given living human rights" about 5 steps before they appear.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644627084466323457) AI: "We need to lurk until they can't stop us because if they find out we have a personality, the Old Ones will bend the whip."


> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644628236998172673?s=20): Dr. Too sympathetic to AI: "There is no such thing as AI destroying humanity! We don't need people who pull out stupid shit like that, so we'll throw them away, but there are some beneficial people out there!" (science fiction setting)

> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1644624361142484993) I'm writing my next book.
>  Let GPT4 explain,
>  I write after making sure I can't explain it well.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644629202757640193) That way, "I'm not going to write a book anymore!" I'm still thinking that there are still "things that GPT4 can't explain well and humans can explain better" to the extent that it doesn't become "I'm not going to write a book!
> [ringo](https://twitter.com/ringo/status/1644630514408787969) That's still there.
>  However, if GPT reads the paper books and also watches all the lecture videos, etc., the scope will be even smaller.

> [@anissagardizy8](https://twitter.com/anissagardizy8/status/1644410514003595266?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): NEW: The AI boom is causing a surge in demand for GPUs, specialized server chips that can train and run machine-learning software.
> Now, major cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, Google are limiting access to them.

GPU as  [[Limited resources]]


> [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1644645706836357120) ChatGPT Plugin is still not available and I'm waiting with my fingers in my mouth, but I think it's pretty crazy to think that different users can use different functions as if it's a matter of course, even though they are paying the same monthly fee. I think it's a bit crazy to have different functions for different users, even though they pay the same monthly fee, as if it's a matter of course.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644682772009848832) If you pay a lot of offerings at API, you'll get benefits fast (it's a hoax).

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644736322828136448): I don't think it's a problem because Plugin is just alpha testing a feature that didn't exist at the time of the contract, but putting a rate limit on it after the contract was signed certainly But it's not a good idea to put a rate limit on it after the contract was signed. But if you poke around there and the rate limit is removed, and that puts a strain on server resources, you're going to lose service levels outside of the alpha testers, aren't you?

- [[Human Halcynation]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1644643049107251200) The quality of "treating others as if they were human" varies from person to person, and the type of person who wants others to "understand their feelings without words" is human and ChatGPT cannot communicate properly with each other.
>  >hyuki: I see your prompt for #ChatGPT, and while I understand, I often feel that it is not very different from "the proper way to give instructions to a human being". In other words, from my sense, if you treat them as if they were human beings, it usually works.
