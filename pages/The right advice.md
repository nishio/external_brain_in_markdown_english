title: "The right advice"
---

- When you think you have given the "right advice," you feel "[[It's not right.]]" when the other person does not follow your [advice
- However, it is [[arrogance]] for an [[advisor]] who does not take any responsibility to try to control the behavior of a person who has [[the responsibility of decision-making]] on his shoulders.
- In that light, it is arrogant to try to give "correct advice" in the first place, or to think that you have done so.


relevance
    - [[People who try to control others.]]
    - [[crime of advising a defendant]]
    - [[Pigs and Chickens]]
