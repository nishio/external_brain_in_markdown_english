** I'm sleepy.

Thinking about it, I woke up at 4:00 a.m. today.
Sleepy.
Let's go home and sleep.


** Code

>|python|
class TopicForm(_TopicForm, CommentForm):    
    typ = forms.ChoiceField(
        widget=forms.RadioSelect(),
        choices=models.TOPIC_STATE_CHOICE,
        label=_("State"),
        initial="public")
||<

Ho. So this is what happens.

>|python|
"\"""""""""""""\""""
||<

Hmmm. I can't think of any examples of it failing.


** Riddle

Why do I get stars and "congratulations on your Hatena debut" just for moving to Hatena Diary?
