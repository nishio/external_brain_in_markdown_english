title: "Advice Merit Demerit"
---

    - The existence of the concept [[crime of advising a defendant]].
- On the other hand, a world in which [[advice]] does not exist at all is not ideal.
- What's the difference.
- For example, when several people are giving advice to a person's statement on a social networking site, people often give advice without looking at what other people are doing.
    - At this time, the expected value is negative because the benefit brought by advice that overlaps with others is zero.
    - Pure evil.
- It is one thing to "give advice" and another to "make sure the advice is useful to the other person."
    - There is always the possibility of giving advice that is not beneficial to the other person because you don't know exactly what their situation is.
    - Generate a profit with probability p and a loss with probability 1-p
    - Expected value should be positive
- Conversely, if the recipient can go through the unhelpful advice at zero cost, the expected value is positive.
    - The lower the cost of responding to advice, the better.
- If the cost of determining whether the advice is correct is high, the expected value is likely to be negative
    - Advice that is not sourced often has a high "can I believe it?" decision cost.
