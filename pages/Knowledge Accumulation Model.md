    - [[Principle that the learning curve is an S-curve]] made simpler.
- Stacking boxes
- When a box is given, if its placement is fully supported, it has probability 1 to place that box.
- If the placement is supported on one side, the box can be placed with a probability of 0.5
- In this case, you can stack the boxes by giving them in order from the bottom
- But what if it is not probability 1?

- The probability of reaching the apex is very low if you just give the boxes in order from the bottom.
- what to do about it
    - convey repeatedly
    - Make sure they understand and tell them if they don't.

This diagram is simplified, so the top box is in a form that depends only on the two bottom boxes
- It actually depends on a lot more boxes, and it doesn't have to have all the boxes to support it.
