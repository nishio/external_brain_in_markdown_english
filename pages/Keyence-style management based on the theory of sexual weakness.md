> [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1903430074780852402) When I was reading a book by Keyence, I read things like, "If you say that philosophy is important and do training, you are neglecting management," "People don't change even if you try to change them. I was too serious when I read something like, "Don't expect people to do what you want them to do" and "Do organizational micromanagement on a minute-by-minute basis so that you don't have to expect people to do what you want them to do".
