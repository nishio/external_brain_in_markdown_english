title: "Ecclesiastes 10:10"
---

from  [[The parable of the lumberjack]]

Words of Qohelet ([[Old Testament]])
- A passage to the effect that "when the axe is dull and unsharpened, more strength is needed, wisdom helps."

Ecclesiastes 10:10
"If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength but wisdom helps one to succeed."

Ecclesiastes 10:10
New International Version
- 10
    - If the ax is dull
    - and its edge unsharpened,
    - more strength is needed,
    - but skill will bring success.

It's less clear whether the wisdom in "wisdom helps" is "sharpening."

"Wisdom helps" means more than just "sharpening the blade."
Center of Metaphor
- It takes extra strength to keep swinging a dull axe.
- Wisdom" refers to (1) the preparation to "sharpen the axe" and (2) the judgment to "choose the right tools and methods in the first place.

original in Hebrew
- The second half is we-yitron ḥokmâ tashlîaḥ ("let wisdom succeed").
- The word "succeed (tashlîaḥ)" has the nuance of leading/promoting, and has a broad meaning of optimizing the entire operation, not just the maintenance of the tools.

Summary of Major Commentaries
- Gill／Geneva
    - Wisdom "shows the way to do things the right way."
- Enduring Word
    - The fool continues to use it dull, but the wise sharpen their blades with forethought = "[[it is]] easier later to use your head first."
- Precept Austin
    - NIV is "skill will bring success." Interpreted to include skill and planning in general.

in other words
Although sharpening is a concrete example,
The essence is "the wisdom of preparation, improvement, and planning.
- Inspect tools and maintain if necessary.
- Review work procedures and avoid unnecessary heavy work.
- Lead to maximum results with minimum effort in manpower, time, and resources.

What this verse teaches is the universal principle of "[[use]] your head rather than your might," and the polishing is just one symbolic scene.
