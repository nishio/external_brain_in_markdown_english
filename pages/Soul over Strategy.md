title: "Soul over Strategy"

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1726847417080037665) You are right that it takes time to see it in action and not in words. I had a problem with that too. I will share with you the solution that I have learned to accelerate the process by using the principle of action.

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1726847418929746176) Avoid the types who are "[[strategically]] selective" with their heads, and try to build relationships with those who are "[love (of)" and have a trembling [[soul]]. You will be enriched by doing so!

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1726850927532122536) Of course, there is often a pattern where the choice is made initially by the "head" and later the "soul" begins to tremble. In this case, the pattern cannot be brought forward. The point is the same as seeing it in action. The [[Lindy effect]] will be a sieve.
