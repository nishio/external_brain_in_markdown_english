Russia's total defeat is already confirmed, so the leaders of each country are discussing how the world should be without Russia, how to prevent China from monopolizing Siberia's resources after Russia collapses, etc. It will be in the history textbooks!

[[Yalta talks]]
- > As World War II entered its final stages, the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan and the establishment of the United Nations were discussed, and the international regime known as the "Yalta System" after World War II was defined by coordinating the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe.
