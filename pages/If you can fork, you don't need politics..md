old title:  [[It's politics that moves what can't be forked.]]
OTHER TITLE: [[No need to play politics with what you can fork]].
- shorten:  [[If you can fork, you don't need politics.]]

[[politics]] is to move what can't be [[forked]].
- Paraphrasing: [[folk]] No need to play politics with what you can
    - So what do we do about it?
    - Case: [[g0v]].
            - [[Forking the social system]]
    - [[social inovation legitimates governance]]
        - Forking, social innovation, and if it works well, it will be legitimized after the fact by people deciding that it is a good thing.
        - [[subjectivism]]
        - In case of disagreement, split into two forks
        - All forks are allowed to exist and it is up to the surrounding community to decide which forks they are interested in
