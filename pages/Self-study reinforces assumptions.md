title: "Self-study reinforces assumptions"

> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1652799924713697281) "Study will broaden your knowledge and balance" because schools were designed to do so, and in an environment where free learning is allowed, once you are in the [[ conspiracy theory]], once you get interested in something, the information comes out and you are hooked. The more you study, the more biased you can become, as seen in the fact that the knowledge base is also addicted to it.
> [daijapan](https://twitter.com/daijapan/status/1652801084031913984) The process of an elderly person coming into contact with the internet, self-taught, exposed to youtube, instagram, learning from books and information provided to the community, and becoming addicted to conspiracy theories is similar. The process of becoming addicted to conspiracy theories is similar.

- [[self-taught reproducing bias]].
- [[self-taught to cancel bias]].

I think there are "people who can do it somehow even though they haven't been taught" and "people who can't do it because they haven't been taught", and I think about how to teach them... and then I think, "What? Then I thought about how to teach them, and I thought, "Well, shouldn't I remove the restriction of 'alone' in the first place? And that's when I started thinking about how to teach.
- People who are not taught but can do it.
- People who can't do it because they haven't been taught.
- I'd better tell you.
    - We'll figure out how to teach.
    - Wouldn't it be better to remove the [[constraint]] of "[[alone]]" in the first place?
    - It is easier to cancel bias through interaction with others than to cancel it on your own.
