<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [I would like to explore the difference between "[[Problem-solving options]]" and "[[Life Choices]]", which are related but slightly different.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What "problem-solving options" are those "problem-solving options"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is already an explicitly identified problem. The solution options for that problem. If you don't know it, you can solve it inefficiently or not solve it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "alternative"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, for a math problem, there is a solution method learned in school. However, there is an implicit restriction that they must be solved with paper and pencil in the examination hall. In the real world, when that restriction is not met, you can either let a computer do the calculations or chat with someone who can solve the problem.

- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "option"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The more choices we have, the better we can solve problems.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that "choice"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>inside the head
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  The more choices we have, the better we can solve problems.
- How do you know what these "options" are?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's an important question. Learn what options are available? This "learning about the options" is itself a problem solver, and you can ask people who might know, or you can use a computer to search
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are these "options" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to put that aside and talk about "life choices."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's worthwhile to deepen my understanding by thinking about the differences, and the better I understand them, the better I can explain them.

- >  I'd like to put that aside and talk about "life choices."
- What would you like to see happen regarding this "option"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hopefully knowing your options will help you make better life choices.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "options" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Need to know the options. What do we need to do to know our options? Learn about the choices, use a computer (search?) or ask someone who might know?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with respect to "choice?"
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is no such thing as a textbook to learn from, and searching, well, sometimes it works, but it's a way to gather information and be more specific about the options you're aware of, and it can be hard to notice the "options you're not aware of". Asking people style has the chicken and egg problem of how to find someone who can answer it first.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does this "choice" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That is a really important question, and I think knowing this will have a great impact on my future life. Why do I think so? Because the choices are shifting from a homogeneous, large supply to a small, diverse supply.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "option" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Like commodities? If there was only one type of mass-produced product, it was whether you could afford it, but when the products are diverse, it becomes which one to choose. But it feels a little different.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Need to know the alternatives. What do we need to know our options? Learn about the options, use a computer (search?) or ask someone who might know?
- What "know your options" is this "know your options"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the past, there was such a term as "role model. However, as society changes rapidly, a 20-year-old cannot use a 40-year-old's way of life as a reference because the surrounding environment is too different. In order to use a role model as a reference, it is necessary to abstract and extract a timeless model, but this is a difficult task for human beings because we all live only once.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "person" is this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>People who will have to live in the future in a situation where they are told that the pace of change is faster and uncertainty has increased and it is doubtful that they will be able to live successfully by referring to role models and their parents' way of life.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>At the very least, you're in trouble if you don't understand the situation and have options other than "do as your parents do."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "parents" are those "parents"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's say you're 45 years old, the first iPhone showed up when you were over 30, and people said at the time, "How can something with no input button like this be popular?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "do" is that "do"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>👎.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "how can something without such an input button be popular" is that "how can something without such an input button be popular"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Lots of people use it now as a matter of course, but it was not there.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is this "person" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The behavior of society is naturally different when there are many people with smartphones in society and when there are none at all.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "people" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, for people in the era of no smartphones and no Twitter, the other people you communicated with were limited to those who were in close physical proximity to you, but the spread of the Internet has created communication that is independent of physical location.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know the "person"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Similarly, getting to know people, the contribution of physical proximity has diminished. What has come to influence it? Proximity of interest, I guess.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "person" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is like an avatar in a game. Can move around and perform activities in virtual (real) space, independent of the physical position of the body.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is its "position"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>hmm
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Need to know the alternatives. What do we need to know our options? Learn about the options, use a computer (search?) or ask someone who might know?
- Is there anything else about this "knowing your options"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>One of the ways I wanted to introduce it was to keep my interests out there.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What are its "interests"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What you want to do, what you want to create, what you want to be, your vision of what you want the world to be like.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  That is an important question. Learn what options are available? This "learning about the options" is itself a problem solver, and you can ask people who might know, or you can use a computer to search
- What kind of "problem solving" is this "problem solving"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll have to ask people about this one itself.
