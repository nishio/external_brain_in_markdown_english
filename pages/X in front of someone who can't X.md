title: "X in front of someone who can't X"
---

This is not a story that can be neatly divided into black and white, but it is interesting to think about how you think when you assign various things to X, and if there is a difference depending on X, why is that?

Example
- Drinking alcohol in front of a minor who cannot drink
- Drinking alcohol in front of people who are constitutionally incapable of drinking
- Drinking alcohol in front of someone who likes to drink but is currently stopped by a doctor for health reasons.
- Eating meat in front of people who cannot eat meat for religious reasons
- Eating meat in front of people who can't eat meat because they associate eating meat with animal suffering.
- Doing math in front of people who can't do math.
- Speaking English in front of people who do not understand English
