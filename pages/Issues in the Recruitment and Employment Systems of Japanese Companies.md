title: "Issues in the Recruitment and Employment Systems of Japanese Companies"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets discusses issues in the recruitment and employment systems of Japanese companies. The main points are as follows

- Large Japanese companies have strong [[personnel power]] in exchange for [[lifetime employment]], so they emphasize [[communication skills]] to reduce the risk of recruitment failure.
- Since companies do not provide specific [[job descriptions]], it is difficult for educational institutions to grasp the kind of human resources that companies are looking for, resulting in a gap between educational content and company needs.
- Companies place importance on communication skills because they hire new graduates with the expectation of long-term success, but in the future, [[language skills]] ([[requirement definition]], [[problem partitioning]], and [[systemization]]) are expected to become more important due to the advancement of IT and mechanization.
- Many Japanese companies do not distinguish between "communication skills" and "verbalization skills.
- The reason why communication skills are emphasized in Japanese companies is because [[work in the field is a mass of tacit knowledge]], and you cannot learn a job without the ability to find out from your seniors.
- Companies do not demonstrate linguistic skills when hiring, and job performance evaluations lack job descriptions, so rules tend to be retrofitted and goals are unclear.
- Tacit knowledge is difficult to understand and improve, and communication skills alone are not sufficient.

These points highlight issues rooted in Japan's employment system and corporate culture. It is imperative to develop human resources with a long-term perspective, clarify job descriptions, and strike a balance between communication and verbalization skills.

This is a story about how large companies have strong personnel rights in exchange for lifetime employment, so when the hiring gaffe fails, they move you to a different department to reduce the risk. ......

>  >Love_yellowhat: Students who were not very diligent in their studies are snatching up job offers from major companies by making use of their communication skills, while modest students who were honest and serious in their studies are not getting a single job offer. It makes me think about a lot of things.


> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548651105286234113) since companies do not offer jobs by job description,
>  Educational institutions don't know what industry is looking for or what to teach students,
>  We have been continuing traditional education for a long time, and there continues to be a disconnect with the human resources that companies want.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548660250244689921) From the company's point of view, they want their new graduates to be active for about 40 years from the time they are hired until they retire,
>  What is a skill that has remained useful for almost 40 years? I'm also talking about the fact that when asked, it's a communicative skill.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548663209032581121) I'm just a commie to hire based on current expectations,

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548663621240377344) And the problem is that many Japanese companies do not distinguish between "communicative competence" and "linguistic competence"... ...

>  "people who build consensus with the other person's emotions", so these are all mixed up.

> [tokoroten](https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1548670286748614658) So why is communal skills such a high priority in Japanese companies?
>  Because the work in the field is a mass of tacit knowledge, and it's only in the mind of the senior staff, so you can't learn the job unless you have the ability to ask that guy out.
>  Get to know each other, work together, and learn somewhat.
>
>  because this is considered "workable".

> [matome55](https://twitter.com/matome55/status/1549028195000729600) In the end, companies don't demonstrate the "ability to verbalize (define requirements, divide problems, systemize)" that Tokoroten wrote above when hiring people. So, as you say, it comes down to this > The job is a mass of tacit knowledge, and it's only in the mind of the senior staff, so you can't learn the job without the ability to ask that guy out.

> [nsh1960](https://twitter.com/nsh1960/status/1548883683070734341) Even if we accept that Japanese companies' "front-line jobs are a mass of tacit knowledge", is it possible that there is a lack of job descriptions not only when hiring from the outside but also when evaluating job performance? Is it possible that there is a lack of job description? The rules are always retrofitted, and only the invisible goal moves. Authority to handle special equipment for goal movement detection?

> [tarosukenet](https://twitter.com/tarosukenet/status/1548698676897271808) You're not even a commie. I mean, if you don't understand it, you can't explain it or improve it, so I guess you don't even understand that it's still tacit knowledge.
