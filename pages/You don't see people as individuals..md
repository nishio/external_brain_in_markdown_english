title: "You don't see people as individuals."

Maybe they don't think of human beings as "individual existence" so much, but rather as "a superposition of various [[features]].
When person X who is different from me is being criticized, I think, "No, but I have the same traits that person has.
I don't feel like, "It's another person, so it doesn't matter."
- [[Identification of people]] may be strong.

Lancaster's [[Characteristics Space]] is an argument for goods, but it may be equally recognizable for people.
