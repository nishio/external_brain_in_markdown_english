title: "Live streaming instead of videoconferencing"
---

- I saw a guy the other day who was trying to teach a class of over 100 people using video conferencing tools and was having trouble limiting the number of people in the class.
- There is also a way to use [[sli.do]] to accept questions, for example.
- If you use a video conferencing tool, like [[Zoom]], you can also use the [[webinar]] function.
