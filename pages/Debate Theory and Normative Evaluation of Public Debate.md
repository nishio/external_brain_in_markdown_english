> Public discussion including [[public involvement]] plays an important role in consensus building for social infrastructure projects. In this study, we summarize the significance and issues of public debate in social infrastructure development, and discuss a theoretical framework to ensure [[legitimacy]] in [[social decision making]] through various discussion processes. In doing so, I introduce the concept of debate system, and point out that public debate consists of micro-discussions targeting specific public debates and macro-discussions targeting the entire debate system, and that public involvement plays a role in joining micro-discussions and macro-discussions. Then, I will discuss the basic principles of public debate that constitute the debate system, issues and problems in realizing desirable debate, and basic ideas for evaluating the desirability of debate.

Discussion System
- Micro-discussions for specific public debates
- Macro Discussion for the entire discussion system

[[What is agreement in the first place?]]

[[Habermas]]
- discussion
- [[establishing intersubjective approval]].
        - [[intersubjectivity]]
