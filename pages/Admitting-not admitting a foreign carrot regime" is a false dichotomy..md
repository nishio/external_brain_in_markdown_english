Claims aside, the diagram is interesting.
Just by looking at this chart, we can see that "approve/not approve of the foreign government" is a false dichotomy.
- Is it national or local?
- Is it optional or only some countries (e.g. British Commonwealth / EU / Nordic countries)?

Personally, I think that if you've lived here for some time, haven't committed a crime, and pay your taxes, you should at least be given the right to vote in the local government that is closest to you.
