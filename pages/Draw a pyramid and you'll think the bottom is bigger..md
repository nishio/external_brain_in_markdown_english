title: "Draw a pyramid and you'll think the bottom is bigger."

from  [[When you draw a tree, you mistake one side for a single]]

- [[Draw a pyramid and you'll think the bottom is bigger.]]
    - Drawing a [[pyramid]] makes the mistake of thinking "more on the bottom, less on the top".
    - [[Misconception that the bottom is bigger than the top]].
- It's in that form in [[Constraints by Gravity]], but when you use it as a metaphor, there's nothing that corresponds to that constraint.
- At first, the language was set to "[[drawing a tree and mistaking one side for a single]]" and "drawing a tree or pyramid and mistaking one side for a single", but in the process of fleshing out the details, the two are two different stories.

- [[The bias of easy drawing]]
