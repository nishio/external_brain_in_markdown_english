2018-12-25
- We talked about "[[be useful]]" and "[[interesting]]."
- Interesting" is [[subjective]].
- Useful" entails objective evidence.
- No evidence of "usefulness" has yet been verbalized or discovered.
- Feelings of "no evidence, but it might be useful in the future."
    - This is one kind of "interesting," but not all.
- Some types of people are not at all interested in whether or not they're useful.
    - Desire to know what is [unknown
    - It's "interesting" to know
- When interviewing scientists, instead of asking, "What's useful?" I mentioned that when interviewing scientists, it is better to ask "What's interesting? would elicit more lively answers than "What's useful?
    - What's in it for you?" is interpreted as "Explain the [[Objective Reasons]] for doing it," and the preconstructed reason is answered.
    - Actual behavior is generated by subjective motivation.
    - The question, "What is it that you do for fun?" The question "What's interesting to you?" is asking about subjective reasons for behavior.
