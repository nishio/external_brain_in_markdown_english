Please explain the difference in nuance between the three words "agreement," "agreement," and "understanding" in Japanese.
### English
[nishio.icon]You are an expert researcher on the Japanese language. The Japanese word "[understanding] "(NATTOKU) seems to be translated as "[agreement]" or "[understanding]" in English.
