title: "Flow/stock is a false dichotomy"
---

The "flow or stock" argument [[False dichotomy]].
- There was a time when the boundary between [[flow]] and [[stock]] was clear.
    - Image from the days when chat was IRC
    - Chat logs were not saved unless each person ran a program on their own to save the logs.

- Those days are in the past.
    - Slack, a chat service, provides chat functionality free of charge
    - The free version only shows 10,000 logs.
    - The business model is that if you want to see everything, you have to pay for it.
    - That is, a model that charges for "access to a stock of chat logs."

- In this day and age, most services have the following features
    - Stock information
    - Provide permalinks to stocked information so that it can be mentioned later
    - Provide a search function for stocked information

The converse is also true.
- Many services have this kind of functionality:.
    - Allows others to respond to what you write
    - Notification of others' reactions
        - Some are slow, but gradually approaching real time
- It will be characterized as a "tool for real-time communication.

Does the "flow/stock" dichotomy make sense in an era when many services have both flow and stock characteristics? → [[hybridization]].

In addition, there is the issue of people using the term "flow/stock" in different ways: [[Unclear dichotomy]].
- I wrote this sentence with the idea that "information flowing through is flow, and information accumulated is stock.
- And I thought, "You know, most of the services that store information nowadays."
