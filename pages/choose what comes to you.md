title: "choose what comes to you"
---

The community's operating policy is the idiom "don't refuse what comes.
It's funny to think of this as if it were the norm.
- No college can admit everyone.
- No company will let just anyone in.
It is more special to be in a situation where "anyone can come in" and not be rejected by those who come.

In the early days of a community, "finding that community and wanting to join it" is a high hurdle in itself, so it's not strange to include anyone who has overcome that hurdle
- If the community is providing value to its members, this state will have more and more people.
- Shouldn't there be a gate at some point beyond a certain number of people?
