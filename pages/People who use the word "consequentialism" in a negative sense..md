People who use the word "[[hindsight]]" in a negative sense.

What the hell is going on!!!!" but in the end it produced economic benefits that far exceeded the cost of installation 😂.

> [@babahnZLOtaurBt](https://twitter.com/babahnZLOtaurBt/status/1562449930433998850): @me_ve1415 @kyu_tyou99 I don't like a bit of consequentialist...
> [@kaito_nogarube](https://twitter.com/kaito_nogarube/status/1562472871540056065): @babahnZLOtaurBt @me_ve1415 @kyu_tyou99 What is the economic impact aimed at? In the end, it's all about results.... No matter how much you estimate, you don't know the effect until you try it. It can't be anything other than consequentialism....

My feeling is closer to the third, "Of course it's consequentialist, but so what?"
- The first person says "I don't like it because it's consequentialist" without offering any other argument, so he implicitly assumes that "consequentialism = bad".
- I wondered if the term "consequentialism" was being used in an ambiguous way.
- What is "consequentialism" anyway?
- Dictionary Meaning
    - > A discussion that looks only at the results of things without considering causes, motives, etc. It's just -."
        - [https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/結果論/](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/結果論/)
    - That's a vaguely negative term.
    - I need a little more word resolution.
        - Discussing the goodness or badness of a decision at a given point in time based on knowledge revealed after that point in time has a name [[hindsight bias]].

    - Ah, I see.
        - In other words, "the opposition is even worse."
    - When someone points out that "Idea A" is "not perfect," whether or not that point is correct is irrelevant to whether or not "Idea B," the opposing candidate, is better.
    - The idea A was that "building a statue of Ralphie would lead to a return on investment that exceeded the amount invested," and it was implemented accordingly, and the results demonstrated that the idea was correct.
        - This "I saw the results, so I think A is right" is indeed "consequentialism"
        - How about the opposing candidate's idea B: "Building a statue of Luffy is a waste of money.
            - At the time of decision making, both A and B were "ideas that may or may not be right".
            - At this point we know that "B was not the right idea."
            - Claiming that A was correct at the time of the decision, based on current observations, is "[[hindsight bias]]."
            - [[Correctness of decision-making]] will be known later.
