title: "The framework fixes the spatial arrangement"
---

- The [[framework]] of a system that fills a [[box]] is accompanied by a [[question]]. However, by filling the box with answers to questions, a [[spatial arrangement]] based on "which question is the answer" is already in place. I have a feeling that this is the root of all evil.

It is good to the point where what was not verbalized is verbalized by answering the question. However, the "what came out" should not be top-down [[Classification.]], but should be looked at as a whole to find if there is anything related to it, but the "seemingly neat and tidy" results of filling in the framework prevent us from breaking it down.

    - [[fixation]]   [[fixation]]
- Here [[spatial arrangement]] is a term in the KJ method.
    - What to do after finding connections between fragmentary information
