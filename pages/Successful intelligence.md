- Successful intelligence is the state of being able to utilize one's own high abilities. Intelligent people do not like to be fools, and those with superior abilities need more to make themselves happy and may experience serious suffering. However, those who believe that superior beings are no happier than inferior beings are confusing two different concepts of happiness and contentment.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>
