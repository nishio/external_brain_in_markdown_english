title: "Justification by mass statement"

from  [[What is logical thinking?]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[discertation]] seems to justify it by quoting [[classic]] instead of "what I think," but in our day and age, we might be able to pick a conflict headline or a quote from a "popular statement."

That is a very interesting perspective. Whereas discertations cite the classics for legitimacy, the possibility of utilizing "popular utterances" as a source of quotations in our time may open up new forms of thinking and discussion. We organize this perspective as follows:

1. significance of classical quotations (traditional discertations)
    - Use of Authority
        - Citing classics is a means of increasing the legitimacy of a claim on the basis that its author and ideas have long been recognized.
        - Especially in philosophy and literature, utilizing the authority of the classics adds depth and weight to the discussion.
    - Approaches to Universality
        - The classics are considered to have universal values and insights that transcend specific eras and cultures, and the discussion is based on them.
    - Educational Background
        - In French philosophical education, students are trained to read the classics and cite their contents to formulate arguments.
2. the contemporary shift to "public speaking
    - Reflecting Diversity
        - By quoting from contemporary "popular statements" rather than the classics, we can incorporate more diverse perspectives.
        - E.g., a wide range of opinions from social networking sites, online forums, and survey data.
    - Emphasis on empathy
        - While the classics are often technical and esoteric, popular statements are everyday, accessible, and likely to have broad resonance.
        - E.g., the quote "many people think this way" gives the reader a sense of realism.
    - Data-driven justification
        - Collect and analyze data on what the masses are saying and use it as the basis for discussion.
        - E.g., platforms like Polis to identify and cite the distribution of opinions and key viewpoints.
...
Redefining Authority
- Position the voice of the masses as "[[democratic authority]]" rather than "authority" based on the classics.
...

4. practical examples
- A modern version of discertation
    - Positive (Thesis): Quotes the opinion of the masses, obtained from social networking sites and forums, and initiates discussion.
    - Anti (antithesis): citing opposing views found on the same platform.
    - Giving a new point of view by integrating these opinions.

5. contemporary values and challenges
- It breaks through the rigidity of the "classic citation format" to enable modern and dynamic discussions.
- It is particularly suited for application in multicultural settings and new problem areas.

issue
- The challenge is how to ensure the quality of the discussion, as statements from the masses may lack consistency and depth.
- It is also necessary to devise ways to eliminate the effects of filter bubbles and echo chambers.
