title: "effectual reasoning"

- [Effection feels natural.
I have heard some say, "In any case, we must choose from the means we can take now," or "We can't take a means we can't take now.
There is no difference in the fact that both methods are chosen from "the means available now" and "the given means. The difference is the timing at which the "objective" is determined.
Calling "the goal is determined before the decision is made" the [[Causal]] approach, he proposes the [[Effective]] approach as its counterpart.
