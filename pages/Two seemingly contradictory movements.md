title: "Two seemingly contradictory movements"
---

There are two [[seemingly contradictory]] movements that can be explained by the low resolution of the starting point concept, which, when separated, can be explained in a consistent manner on a different axis than the axis we are currently focusing on.

- In "From work to a task" in [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]], the author asks why there are situations in which escaping "[[work]]" is worth living for, and situations in which "working" is a [[raison d'être]]. The discussion of "work" is divided into two categories: "[[work]]" and "[[task]]".

- In this figure, there is a movement V from A to B and vice versa, and a movement U from B to A, seemingly [[inconsistency]].
    - Appears to move in the opposite direction on the implicitly assumed axis X
- But it is from concept A [Low resolution
- Take a closer look at concept A and find P and Q in it.
- V is movement from P to B, U is movement from B to Q
    - This is a movement in the same direction on axis Y

    - [Proceed in reverse, but the goal is the same.
    - [[Same name assigned to different things.]]
