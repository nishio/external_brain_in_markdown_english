Change in [[competitive conditions]] due to tools

Capability enhancement X provided by a tool T, and capability Y independent of it.
If the two are constrained by a common resource (e.g., drop time), a [[trade-off]] relationship occurs
However, if in that situation another resource, for example, a tool that can be bought with money, enhances capability X, the competitive conditions change.

People who gave up X to get Y get angry at those who got X without giving up.
Whoever was getting X at the expense of Y.
- Disgusted by people who get X without sacrificing Y?
    - There's a case for that.
        - A career woman who has given up on having a family and chosen a career snubs a junior woman who wants to balance family and work.
    - Whether there is a limit to X
        - Those who are aiming higher, regardless of others, will say, "I can make more X's with this tool T!" and they'll be happy about it.
        - Cartoonists who are happy to use generative AI, etc.


I saw the jealousy towards those who write and release code in AI even though they don't have great programming skills, and I was thinking what that is.
