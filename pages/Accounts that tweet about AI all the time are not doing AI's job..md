title: "Accounts that tweet about AI all the time are not doing AI's job."

> [fladdict](https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1643975650196463618) When you start talking a lot about AI, you get a lot of AI work. [[When you start doing lots of AI work, you can't talk about AI]]. What a contradiction.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643978852740530184) Knowledge: "Accounts that tweet all over the place about AI are not doing AI's job."

When an account that has been tweeting a lot goes quiet, an outside observer cannot tell if "the person's AI [[prevalence (e.g., of a disease)]] is over" or if "the person's [[transmission]] has led to AI [[work]]".
[[No third party can tell if he was bored or if it led to a job]].
[[quiet when working]]

## digest
.
A contradiction was noted that when a person tweets a lot about AI, more AI work is done, and as a result, less is sent out about AI. The finding that accounts that tweet a lot about AI are not doing AI work is also presented, and it is stated that when the account goes quiet, a third party cannot tell if the AI fad is over or if the person's transmission has led to AI work.

## Relation to Fragment
.
- [["AI will take our jobs" is a low job resolution.]] Related to the fragment, the note that more communication about AI will increase AI jobs is consistent with the fragment that AI will take our jobs. Also, the content of the note that less dissemination about AI is related to the content of the fragment that more people will be able to take advantage of AI and, as a result, less dissemination about AI will be necessary.

## deep thinking
Dissemination about AI and the increase or decrease of AI jobs affect each other: as AI develops, the need for understanding and the ability to utilize AI increases, while the need to disseminate about AI decreases as its development progresses. This indicates a contradictory phenomenon in which the development of AI promotes its understanding and utilization, thus making dissemination about AI unnecessary.

[[**Title of Thought]]
"[[A contradiction between the development of AI and its dissemination]]."
