title: "Cutting down inefficiencies is thoughtless."
---

[[Cutting down]] on [[inefficiency]] is [[acting without thinking]].
- I think [[the bicycle parking discussion]] is a situation where [[the cost of the discussion]] is higher than the price paid as a result of the discussion, but I guess you could say that cutting out inefficiencies is, in other words, stopping to think. The resources that can be invested [[are not infinite]], so stopping to think may be inevitable sooner or later.
