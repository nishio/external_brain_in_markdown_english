I used GrandPerspective to organize my MacBook's hard drive because I ran out of space.

It's a waste of time to delete small files one by one.

There's some great garbage in there!

The big one on the bottom left was Windows in VMWare and so on. The top left one is a bunch of similarly sized podcasts. On the right side, there are various swapfiles, but I don't think I can delete them. I scanned from /, but I could have scanned from /Users/nishio.

I'm a little concerned that it looks like I have several iPhone backups, but oh well, I guess I'll leave it at that for now today. I have things to do.
