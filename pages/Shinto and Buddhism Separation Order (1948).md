The Shinto/Buddhist Separation Order was one of the policies enforced in Japan during the Meiji era. This was against the backdrop of the Meiji government's attempt to establish "[[State Shinto]]" as the foundation of a new national system. The following is an in-depth explanation.

Background of the Shinto/Buddhist Separation Order:
- The Meiji Restoration and the Establishment of the Modern State: The Meiji government aimed to build a modern state to compete with Western powers on an equal footing. In this context, the establishment of "National Shinto" was sought to strengthen the nation's identity.
- Shinto and Buddhism: Since the Heian period (794-1192), Shinto and Buddhism have had a close relationship, coexisting in the form of "[[a]] syncretism between Shinto and Buddhism. It was not uncommon for Shinto and Buddhism to be enshrined together, with Buddhist temples attached to many shrines.

Content and impact of the Shinto/Buddhist Separation Order:
- Enforcement: In 1868, the Shinto and Buddhist Temples Law was issued, ordering the separation of shrines and temples. Subsequently, related instructions and directives were issued to promote a policy of clear distinction between Shinto and Buddhism.
- Impact: As a result of this decree, many temples were banished from the shrine grounds, Buddhist statues and Buddhist artifacts were destroyed, and other measures were taken. In some areas, in particular, the suppression of Buddhism intensified, resulting in the loss of many Buddhist cultural properties.
- Establishment of National Shinto: Influenced by the Shinto-Buddhist Separation Order, Shinto was positioned as the official religion of the nation, increasing the importance of Shinto under a state system centered on the emperor.

Conclusion:
- The Shinto/Buddhist Separation Order was an important policy of the Meiji government to establish a national Shinto religion as part of its efforts to build a modern nation. It changed the religious landscape of Japan, and the relationship between Shintoism and Buddhism changed dramatically.
