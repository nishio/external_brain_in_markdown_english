- Philosophy for human conversation: [[roti]] and [[pragmatism]] in the 21st century
    - [[Ki-Tseh Zhu]]

> "Rediscovering Rorty, the unsung philosopher, as someone who continually tried to be the guardian of the "human conversation." Zhu Ki-zhe vividly describes the significance of Rorty's attention in today's chaotic Japan and the world.
>  The search for "the only true voice", led by a philosophy that has been in the tradition since ancient Greece, makes people's small voices muffled.
>  "[[Miscellaneous and diverse multiple voices]]", isn't that conversation the hope for a rich human life?
>  Philosopher Rorty took on many critics, but he took on the task of philosophy to defend those voices.
>  This book provides a comprehensive portrait of Rorty, including later perspectives from earlier studies, by focusing on [[Misak]] in Part I, [[Sellars]] in Part II, and [[Brandham]] in Part III.
>  At the same time, it also clarified its contemporary significance and how it can be referenced to political and social situations.
>  By thus clarifying the significance of pragmatism with Rorty's thought at its center, the book also hopefully reveals a philosophy that connects the classics to the future.
