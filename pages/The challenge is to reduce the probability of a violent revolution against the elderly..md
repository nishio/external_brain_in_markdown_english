<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In order to reduce the probability of a violent revolution by young people against the elderly in Japan, multiple factors must be considered and countermeasures taken. This section discusses factors to be considered and measures to be taken to reduce the risk of such a violent revolution.
- Reduction of socioeconomic disparities
    - Equal educational and employment opportunities: reduce social inequality by ensuring that all young people have access to quality education and good jobs.
    - Financial assistance: grants and subsidies to help young people start businesses or learn new skills.
- Strengthening social cohesion
    - Facilitate intergenerational dialogue: create a platform where young people and the elderly can engage in direct dialogue and share their values and experiences with each other.
    - Collaborative Projects: Promote projects in which different generations work together to solve community issues.
- Investing in Mental Health
    - Strengthen mental health support: increase the availability and quality of mental health services available to young people when they feel stressed or anxious.
    - Improved quality of life: Improve the quality of life for young people by improving access to recreation and outdoor activities.
- Education and Awareness
    - Enhanced historical education: by learning about the consequences of past revolutions and social changes, students will understand that violence is not the solution.
    - Introduce peace education: educate young people on values that emphasize dialogue and peaceful solutions.
- Promoting Youth Participation in Policy Making
    - Promote youth participation in politics: Ensure that young people are involved in the policy-making process and that their views are reflected.
    - Integration of multi-generational voices in the decision-making process: It is important to equally incorporate the views of various generations in policy making.

Through these measures, it is possible to increase understanding and respect between young people and older adults and reduce the risk of violent conflict.

Discussions about the relationship between the elderly and the young in Japan and efforts to promote intergenerational harmony are wide-ranging. For example, on the subject of the "old-youth conflict," there is a strong voice of the elderly in Shibuya Ward, where there is a sense that nothing can be left for future generations. However, through an exhibit on aging at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan), it is shown that technology can help us and prevent divisions from arising. Using wise design, it is suggested that we find common solutions rather than conflicts between the old and the young. For example, methods such as "Quadratic Voting," which emphasizes opinions common to different generations, are considered (from [from [/plurality-japanese/old-young-conflict](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/old-young-conflict)).

The problem of "silver democracy" has also been pointed out, in which the political influence of the elderly increases and the opinions of the young and middle-aged are less likely to be reflected in politics as a result. This situation may have the detrimental effect that measures for the elderly tend to be prioritized (from [[silver democracy]] , [/plurality-japanese/silver-democracy](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/silver-democracy)).

Avenues are being explored to mitigate generational conflicts and promote harmony by harnessing the power of technology and design to help old and young work together to find common solutions to these challenges. It is hoped that these efforts will play a role in preventing extreme situations such as the violent revolution of youth against the elderly.

Isn't the inequity of the cost burden growing if the youth side is paying the cost and the elderly side is saying no? Shouldn't the elderly bear greater costs and risks?

[[intergenerational responsibility and cost sharing]] needs to be considered in terms of [[fairness]] and [[sustainability]]. Through innovations in technology and social institutions, efforts are proposed to ease the division between generations and find common solutions, which will require the active involvement and shared responsibility of not only the young but also the elderly.

For example, the exhibit at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation aims to help young people understand the position of the elderly, and it is important that such an initiative be interactive. The elderly must also understand and empathize with the position of the youth and the challenges they are currently facing. This allows the elderly to take advantage of their political advantage to seek a more balanced approach to solving intergenerational challenges (from [[old-youth conflict]], [/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Panel Discussion Transcript machine translation](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Panel Discussion Transcript machine translation)).

It is also proposed that new voting and funding mechanisms such as "Quadratic Voting" and "Quadratic Funding," in which different generations pool their funds for a common purpose, be adopted to alleviate inequities in cost burdens and achieve more equitable and effective solutions (from [[old/young conflict]], [/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan panel discussion summary](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan panel discussion summary)).

Ultimately, intergenerational compromise and cost sharing should not be simply one side stepping up to the other, but a process where both sides understand each other's position and work together to find solutions. It is important that both the elderly and the young contribute and cooperate from their own perspectives to create a better future for society as a whole.
