<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be good to get organized on the concept of metaphor.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "metaphor" is this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The creation of metaphors accelerates verbalization.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/> I've been re-reading [[Eugene Gendlin's Metaphor Concept]] thinking it might be related, but I haven't quite made the connection for myself yet.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Right now it feels like it's up in the air, not in my gut.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I've been re-reading it because I thought it might be related to Eugene Gendlin's concept of metaphor, but I haven't quite made the connection for myself yet.
- How do you know this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Metaphors are born, you see what is born, this is a metaphor.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>What this "my use of the word metaphor" refers to is the image of a fish that is in the sea of non-verbalized things and sometimes comes up near the surface of the water, but with this metaphor, I don't understand the connection to "accelerated verbalization".
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "metaphor" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Something else.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I've been re-reading it because I thought it might be related to Eugene Gendlin's concept of metaphor, but I haven't quite made the connection for myself yet.
- What "concept" is this "concept"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Eugene Gendlin's concept of metaphor is one of the seven ways of working with felt sense, a creative functional relationship
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Eugene Gendlin" is this "Eugene Gendlin"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A philosopher who discussed the process of experience and the creation of meaning from it
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "creation" is this "creation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Meaning is created anew.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "meaning" of this "meaning"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(That's a very abstract question.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Most people do not understand "making meaning" in relation to their own experience, when they are trying to put into words what they cannot say well, and they cannot express it in the common usage of the word, so they express it as a personal metaphor, This is an imagining of meaning by metaphor, or, to put it in Merleau-Ponty's terms, an "emerging language" that has not been institutionalized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about its "meaning"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Would it be easier to convey the meaning if I described it as taking a piece of the experience and assigning a new word to it, rather than describing it as having created meaning?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This discussion is a verbalization of the "process by which useful things are produced," and if we can clarify this point, we may be able to find a way to support it. If we can support it, it will be beneficial because it will improve the intellectual productivity of humankind. Personally, I would like to let people produce intellectually without human intervention, but whether this is possible or not remains to be seen.

- >  Most people do not understand "making meaning" in relation to their own experience, and a more obvious way of expressing this is when they try to put into words something that they cannot say well, and since it could not be expressed in the common usage of the word, they express it as a personal metaphor. This is an imagining of meaning by metaphor, or, in Merleau-Ponty's terms, an "emerging language" that has not been institutionalized.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Now, I was thinking that the concept of metaphor that I had been using and the concept of metaphor that Eugene Gendlin had been using were not well connected, and I wished they could be connected.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "metaphor" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I just realized that this is the process of creating new meanings through the reaction of two felt-sense chunks, as Eugene Gendlin described in the metaphor process. So first we divide those two symbols into "yumetapha" and "nimetapha. Then we form the metaphor "Nimetapha is Umetapha". Then a new aspect would be born.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's try it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I just realized that this is a process where new meaning is created by the reaction of two felt sense chunks as Eugene Gendlin described in the metaphor process. So first we divide those two symbols into "yumetapha" and "nimetapha. Then we form the metaphor "Nimetapha is Umetapha". That would create a new aspect.
- Where does this "metaphor" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Nimetapha comes from a sea of unspoken experiences, and Umetapha is not told where it comes from.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "verbalization" is this "verbalization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It's about a mass of felt sense being inscribed and mapped to a symbol.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "felt sense" is that "felt sense"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Created by experience and floundering without being symbolized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "symbol" is this "symbol"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Anything, just a random string
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I just realized that this is a process where new meaning is created by the reaction of two felt sense chunks as Eugene Gendlin described in the metaphor process. So first we divide those two symbols into "yumetapha" and "nimetapha. Then we form the metaphor "Nimetapha is Umetapha". That would create a new aspect.
- Is there anything else about this "Eugene Gendlin"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, not really now.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Nimetapha comes from a sea of unspoken experiences, and Umetapha is unspoken where it comes from.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "verbalization"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In Nimetapha, the sea and the fish were distinguished, but in Yumetapha, the fish is what carved the sea.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "umetapha" is this "umetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Two different symbols are joined by an equal
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "symbol"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Is Nimetapha not Umetapha? I feel like it's a process of yumetapha generation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "umetapha" and "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Yumetapha is talking about after the metaphor was born.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "yumetapha" the same as "metaphor"? Are they different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No, Umetapha is referring to the use of the old symbols after coming up with the idea of using them to describe a new experience, and Nymetapha is talking about the front part of how he came up with the idea.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "metaphor" when its "yumetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The metaphor is already in place, so it won't change.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No, Umetapha calls it a metaphor, referring to the use of an old symbol after one comes up with the idea of using it to describe a new experience, while Nimetapha is talking about the front part of how one comes up with the idea.
- Is there anything else you can tell us about this "umetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Since this is the second half, should I delve into the nimetaphors in regards to what I want to do? Useful for an explanation of what objectively happens when a metaphor is created in Nimetapha.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its "nimetapha" and "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Nimetapha sees process of catching big fish
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "Nimetapha" the same as "Metaphor"? Are they different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>No. The result of the Nimetapha is a symbol used as a metaphor.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "metaphor" during that "nimetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Newly found
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No, the result of the Nimetapha is a symbol that is used because it could not be metaphorical.
- What kind of "nimetapha" is this "nimetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Nimetapha has been likened to "pulling up a big fish with a hook," that is, the process of combining small metaphorical symbols and pulling out new symbols that have not yet been revealed by the relationships between the symbols.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the difference between its "nimetapha" and "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Each hook is a you-metaphor, and each one hammered in creates a new aspect to the mass of felt sense.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the difference between its "umetapha" and "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>What is between the individual youmetaphors and metaphors in the nymetaphor... the metaphor, a giant fish, is enclosed by the aspects created in the individual youmetaphors.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "nimetapha" when its "metaphor"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Feedback occurs on the nimetapha, making it even stronger.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "nimetapha"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(I drew a diagram.)
