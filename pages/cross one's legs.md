>  A Latino family sat facing each other, flopping down and crossing their legs.
>  I wanted to pass by these people, so I indicated my intention to (pass by) and walked on, but they didn't retract their feet a millimeter, and as I expected, my skirt got caught. I looked at them and they stared at me the other way.
>  You can cross your legs if it's empty, but if someone walks by, at least avoid them a little. All the seats were occupied, but this family was the only one with their legs crossed.
>
>  I got off at Akihabara like a tourist, but I don't need these ill-behaved foreigners to pick at me. The number of foreigners around my house has also visibly increased, but the amount of trash littering the streets has clearly increased in the last year or two.

>  "I'm not going to say anything, but guess what I'm thinking. If you guess wrong, you're a hub." That's why people around the world see you as a communicator.

> [ParrotMystery](https://x.com/ParrotMystery/status/1804229874649042959) I think the feeling of "it's rude to cross one's legs" is a feeling that people who are not used to sharing a small space with an unspecified number of people would not understand at all.
>
>  In the West, on the contrary, gestures such as crossing one's legs or arms are considered reserved, so these people may be surprised to learn that the Japanese around them feel it is "pompous" or "impolite.
