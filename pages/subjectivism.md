Concepts explained in Vitalik Buterin's [The Subjectivity / Exploitability Tradeoff

Pure subjectivism is defined quite simply.
    - If all agree, then [[unanimous]].
    - If there is a disagreement between Decision A and Decision B, [[blockchain]]/[[DAO]] is split into two [[folk]], with one fork implementing Decision A and the other implementing Decision B.
    - [[All forks are allowed to exist and it is up to the surrounding community to decide which forks they are interested in]]
- Subjectivism is, in a sense, the ultimate non-coercive [[form of governance]].
    - [[No one is forced to.]]
        - No one is [[enforced]] to accept a situation that is not the way they want it.
    - However, if you have unpopular policy preferences, you will end up in a fork with few others to interact with you.
