title: 'The old man''s "I''ve done it before" is worthless.'
---

People who dabble in this or that usually have "been there, done that" when it comes to things that have been around for a long time.
There's no scarcity of old people who've done it before, because there are plenty of old people who have swept it off their feet.
Even if you've "done a little of this in the past," if you haven't done it recently, the opinion of someone who has "done a little of this recently" is more valuable
