Face icon freed from the physical body
- I just changed my face icons, but you say "[[I want to be free of my physical body...]]" and "[Using live-action icons simply because they are familiar is inconsistent.

- I'll try to use it as an icon for a while because it's interesting to see the atmosphere it retains.

    - I felt like [using live-action icons simply because they are familiar is inconsistent.
    - Then, a story about creating avatars from photos came up on Twitter, and we thought, "Why not use this as an avatar (icon) for the time being?

        - Yes, given the examples of others, I got used to it in a few days.

        - Certainly those who change icons will be recognized as those who change icons, so when they change, it will be "again," but for those who don't, it will be "I can't get used to it..." for a while.
            - Not "get used to changing icons," but more abstract.[[Ability to adapt to change]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - For example, you go to an electronics store because your mouse is broken, and you buy a trackball that you happen to see and return home (true story).

                - It is a feeling of wanting to change things when you realize that you have become accustomed to a certain way of doing things and take it for granted.

Face icon freed from the physical body
- I came up with a face icon with no physicality<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Isn't it more obvious than the previous one?
    - grass<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - When I saw the icon, I first thought "who is this?", then I saw the description and figured out that it must be "nishio-san", and then I went to the user page to check the answer.
            - [[Concept of Face]] Scared
    - easy to understand<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/bluemountain/icon' alt='/villagepump/bluemountain.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I recognized it instantly because I watched nishio's PROJECT and I remember the shades. w<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/erniogi/icon' alt='/villagepump/erniogi.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/teyoda7/icon' alt='/villagepump/teyoda7.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - When I think of a face, I think of a real face, and this is certainly a face.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/kuuote/icon' alt='/villagepump/kuuote.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I will probably continue to use "real name + photo" as a [[legacy interface with society]], but I think I'll work this way in places where I don't need to use my real name...
