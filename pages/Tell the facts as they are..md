In this series of tweets, based on the results of an international survey of journalists, the problems with Japanese journalism are pointed out.
The main points are as follows
1. the percentage of journalists in Japan who consider it important to "tell the truth as it is" is significantly lower (65.1%) than in other countries.
2. Japanese journalists tend to emphasize "setting the political agenda" but not "being an objective observer" or "allowing people to express their opinions.
3. It has been pointed out that this is due to the fact that many Japanese journalists did not major in journalism at university (12.5%) and that on-the-job training had not been established until recently.
4. the view that the improvement of university education is also in a difficult situation.

In other words, Japanese journalism tends to emphasize political agenda-setting over objective reporting of facts, and it has been pointed out that this is due to problems in education and training.

Those majors have long since occupied faculty positions with people who've been beaten out of the "field" and left with false beliefs and ideologically biased disciples.
