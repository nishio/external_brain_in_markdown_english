<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sge/icon' alt='sge.icon' height="19.5"/>Ameisen-sou" is a four-character idiom that refers to the noisy cries of frogs and cicadas, or, in other words, to sentences with little content, fruitless discussions, and loud assertion of opinions that are off the mark. It is used to mock things that are only noisy and useless, or that have little substance due to many useless expressions and phrases.

- [[Parable of the Summer Cicadas]]
