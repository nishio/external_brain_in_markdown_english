- [[overestimation]] in Value of Ideas

People who say "[[Pacifier]]" or "I [[had an idea]] too" when others realize an idea that they did not realize.
People who get depressed when someone else has already come up with an idea they came up with.

They are both the same
- Overestimating the value of an idea.
- So stick to "what you came up with."

[["Is an idea worthwhile or not?" is a false dichotomy]].
- [[Ideas are worthless.]]
- Value.
- Worthless.
    - [[False dichotomy]]

- [[The ideas that you come up with, other people come up with.]]

The topic of ideas is always an interesting one. On the other hand, we often tend to overestimate the value of ideas. This article explores that phenomenon.

For example, when others realize ideas that they did not realize, some people say that they are "pacifists" or claim that they had the idea too. Others feel sadness or disappointment when someone else has already thought of an idea they came up with.

Both of these are indications of overestimating the value of an idea. This is because those feelings are the result of adhering to "what I came up with".

The problem, however, is that the dichotomy of whether an idea has value or not is itself false. The idea that an idea may or may not have value is a soil for misunderstanding.

The truth is that the idea itself is not merely valuable or not valuable; its value is determined by how the idea is utilized, embodied, or what is created through the idea.

An idea creates value when it solves a real problem or opens up new possibilities. And it is not the idea itself that is important, but how it is implemented or how the process is carried out that creates actual value.

Therefore, we need to rethink the value of ideas. It is important to focus on the value created by realizing an idea and to free ourselves from overvaluation of the idea itself.
