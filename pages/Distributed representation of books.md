title: "Distributed representation of books"
---

    - [[Distributed representation of characters]] 、 [[Distributed representation of words]] 、 [[Distributed representation of sentences]]
    - I was thinking about it, and it seemed natural that books would also have their own [[distributed representation]].
- A distributed representation of a book is of course different from a "distributed representation of the title of a book as a short sentence"
    - Often the book's content and title do not match.
- The book has a table of contents and a set of short sentences called chapter titles
    - There is of course a "[[Distributed representation of chapters]]" which is different from the distributed representation of this chapter title.
- Books are often referred to as "p.XX in book XX
    - There is of course the "[[Distributed representation of pages]]" as well.

    - The mechanism that takes [[Distributed representation of this title]] as input and returns [[Distributed representation of this content]] is the [attention mechanism

- For example, I have done [[KJ method]] with book covers as stickies
        - [[Clean space + KJ method experiment]]
    - This "sticky note position" is a two-dimensional vector
    - It is possible to mix this with distributed representations: [[Merging Distributed Representations]].
        - [[Is rotational neglect appropriate?]]
