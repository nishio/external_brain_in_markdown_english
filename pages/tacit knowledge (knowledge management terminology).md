title: "tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)"
---

There is some discrepancy between Polanyi's (1966) and Ikujiro Nonaka's concept of tacit knowledge.
see
    - [[Dimensions of tacit knowledge]]
    - Focus on new discoveries by scientists
    - [[SECI Model]] ( [[knowledge creation company]] )
    - Focus on knowledge transfer within the organization

> Tacit knowledge is a concept that indicates that "if there is such a thing as knowledge, then behind it there is always an action of "knowing" that has an implicit dimension. In this sense, it is better translated as "tacit knowing.
> Therefore, to eliminate the human factor from knowledge as "arbitrary" would deny the tacit process of "knowing," which can never be reduced to manipulation, and thus destroy knowledge itself. It is widely held that "tacit knowledge" is simply equated with "unspeakable knowledge," but this is a misunderstanding, as pointed out by Ayumi Yasutomi.
> Nonaka defined "tacit knowledge" as "knowledge based on experience or intuition that is difficult to express in words or other means," and opposed it to "formal knowledge" to construct his theory of knowledge management. Nonaka classifies "tacit knowledge" into two dimensions, including the cognitive dimension, in addition to the technical dimension. This tacit knowledge theory of Nonaka is fundamentally different from Polanyi's theory and should be seen as Nonaka's own "ingenuity.
[Tacit knowledge - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9A%97%E9%BB%99%E7%9F%A5)
This is a term that should be used with care because of the opinion that

> Tacit knowledge does not refer to the vague knowledge that is hidden in the subconscious and therefore cannot be retrieved. It is not the knowledge that lives hidden in the subconscious. Apparently, some management scholars have promoted such a view, and the misunderstanding has spread.
