title: "Send wallet by registered mail and return postage with a fixed amount money order."
---

I left my wallet at a hotel and had it sent to me by [[registered mail]].

It arrived in an envelope that looked like this

They even included a return envelope asking me to send a receipt that I received the package, and I thought it was a hassle and a heartbreaking almost $1,000 shipping cost.
- Registered cash 825 yen
- 84 yen for return postage
- Total 909 yen

I asked the staff at the post office if there was a better way, and they recommended [[a fixed-sum money order]].
- You can also send out a money order, which is not a fixed amount, but I heard it costs about 500 yen in that case.
    - About 1,400 yen
- Fixed-amount money orders have a 200 yen fee instead of a fixed amount.
    - About 1,200 yen
