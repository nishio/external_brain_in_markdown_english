I remember mentioning it a few times here and there.
- Seemingly completely unrelated, but when the perspective is moved, a relationship is discovered.
    - Just as things that do not appear to overlap from one perspective appear to overlap from another perspective.
- > I believe the best use of the cards is to "trust" them, even if they are unclear. The cards will show you another way that wasn't obvious at first. ([[Oblique Strategies]])
        - [It is human beings who interpret oracles.
        - [[Relationships are found after the fact.]] by thinking, "This must be related," rather than immediately discarding seemingly non-overlapping items.
        - New perspectives that seem relevant" are explored.
            - Examples: [[My lover grows out of the earth like a red rose]] , [[The writing process is like a dull backache.]] in [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 4]]

Locations where similar figures have been used in the past
    - [[What is the intersection of meaning?]]
    - [[At what point do we need to point people to each other in an argument?]]

- [[point of view]]
