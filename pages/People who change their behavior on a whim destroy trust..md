- People who change their behavior to [[whim]] destroy [credit

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Don't spin out of control.

Your actions should not be unusual because of your temperament or whims. A competent person is always the same in his best qualities and can be credited with being trustworthy. If he changes, it is for good reason or due consideration. As for behavior, change is frowned upon. There are different people every day. Their intellect varies, their will varies even more, and with this, their luck varies as well. Yesterday's white is today's black, today's no is yesterday's yes. They constantly lie to their own credit and destroy their credibility with others.
