- [[No one is equal to the market.]]
- The number of votes received is like market share.
- Sold only once.
    - Pre-survey and adjust
        - We can change, we can improve.
        - If you can't change, you can't improve, so all you can do is drag your enemies down.
- Individuals saying "this stuff doesn't sell" without research is a typical "opinion that shouldn't be referenced."
    - Need to find unexpected customers
        - Anything imaginable is already a commodity
    - I think the fact that they rolled up the intelligentsia first, rather than the young vs. the elderly, was aimed at them.
        - High affinity makes it easy to take advantage of strengths.
    - It became clear after the fact that it was surprisingly appreciated by the elderly.
        - Unexpected Success

Software Unexpected Success
- Engineers tend to say, "We didn't do much."
- This is a situation where "the maker's own subjective cost (and the market reaction inferred from that cost)" is out of line with the actual market reaction.
    - Observed fact that the market reaction was "many customers subjectively perceived value".
    - Reaction guesses were wrong.
        - Since it is difficult to make this guess with a high degree of accuracy in the first place, the idea of the lean cycle was born, in which the fastest testable product is created and released, and the cycle of improvement is carried out while observing the reaction to the product.
    - In the first place, the mental model that "cost spent by the creator" and "market reaction" are strongly correlated is wrong.
        - Leads to "I've worked so hard, but I'm not appreciated" type thinking
- Drucker's 7 Opportunities for Innovation
    - It is important to focus on unexpected successes and expand
    - The Parable of the Rolling Snowball

Frankly, I'm wondering if we've already passed the tipping point in history.
- If you are the Governor of Tokyo, the history books will say that the digital democratic revolution in Japan went smoothly without protests and demonstrations
- If he does not become governor, the triggers drawn in the gubernatorial election will cause the post-gubernatorial
    - There are also those who "could not endorse a particular candidate because of their position, but supported him or her."
    - People gather to form a tsuyotsuyu group.
        - No longer limited to Tokyo residents.
    - It caused a digital democratic revolution in the years to come, the history books will say.
I feel that the latter has reached a level that is already well attained.
- So during the campaign, we'll do everything we can to achieve the former.
- The message that "the latter has already been accomplished" creates the interpretation that they are not seriously pursuing the former, so they don't actively send it out.
    - Some critics say, "He doesn't really want to get elected."
        - It seems like a natural strategy to me, having experience in tackling uncertainty, to have a two-tiered goal set, with an easy goal in the foreground and then tackle the more difficult stretch goal after the easier goal is achieved.
        - Some people seem to think that it is better to hit a difficulty with no plan and then scatter with a flourish, but that is not the proper strategy.
- The key to the former stretch goal is to become known to "people who don't know you yet" anyway!
    - What can we do to make that happen?
        - This in itself, wouldn't it be a good idea to use broad listening to identify what the obstacles are and then take action?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807589775807025464) To put this into words that I feel are often overlooked, the feature of this project is that there are many IT engineers among the volunteer supporters, not in the form of outsourcing systems or outsourcing work, and that is why the project was initially not planned to be created. Therefore, "Phone AI Anon", "Poster Map", and "Advance Voting Map", which were not planned to be created at the beginning, were created based on the situation, which is a bottom-up business improvement.
>  >takiyori0608: I find it interesting that there's a "tech blog" thing in the election, or that there's a "development team" to begin with.
>  Also, I think it's very healthy to discuss based on the feedback we received and update the manifesto during the election period - I think it's very healthy. #Takahiro Yasuno #TOKYOAI x.com/jujunjun110/st...


> [nojiri_h](https://x.com/nojiri_h/status/1807587917105394059) Takahiro Yasuno's manifesto is easy to understand because it is monotone, has few words, and uses red at key points.

> [uudaiy](https://x.com/uudaiy/status/1807241474599461030) Although there is criticism that people who cannot use technology are left behind, my own mother, who is blind due to a congenital visual impairment, uses LINE and her smartphone to communicate with her son. She can even read my books on her Kindle with voice reading. Technology should be open to those who don't have it #TOKYOAI

> [tamuramble](https://x.com/tamuramble/status/1803937911261532514) Mr. Yasuno, I think you've got every single one of the progressive intellectuals who make up about 5% of Tokyo's population on your side, so I think you should tell a relatable personal story to appeal to the remaining 95%. I think you should tell your personal story to appeal to the remaining 95%, but I think that is actually the most difficult part.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1807209270536265993) I don't dance, but I have a bad video of a poster on TikTok that has 2000 likes (I don't usually use TikTok, so I don't know how great this is. I don't use TikTok so I don't really know how great this is).

> [copermincof](https://x.com/copermincof/status/1807073037461934320) The "older generation" of middle-aged and older adults have been expecting politics and being disappointed, repeatedly.
>  I can understand why he would come around to support the idea that he would be the one to > update democracy.
>  >nishio: "Support from older people is stronger than expected, and the argument of enriching the country with technology is also supported by people in their 80s, and I think the reason is that they have experienced it as their own.
