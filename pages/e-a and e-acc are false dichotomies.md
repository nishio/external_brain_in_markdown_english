title: "e/a and e/acc are false dichotomies"
---

[[e/a]] and [[e/acc]] are [[False dichotomy]].
- The story is that although seemingly at odds, they are actually moving in the direction of "[[no redundancy]]" in common in that they assume that being [[efficient]] is a good thing, and this is a problem.

>  Whether e/acc (effective accelerationism) or e/a (effective altruism), the question is not whether it is accelerationism or altruism, but whether it is "effective".
