title: "Three kinds of anger and usefulness"
---

2018-10-04
I had a friend who claimed "[[Anger is beneficial.]]" and I thought "Anger is basically harmful," but then it occurred to me that there are different kinds of anger. #Anger is toxic to the body

    - [[Anger toward others]]
    - [[Anger over transitory events]]
    - [[Anger at the ongoing system]]

Of the three, anger at the ongoing system is useful. It's the driving force that leads to systemic improvements.
