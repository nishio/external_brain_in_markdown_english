title: "Self-assessment of craftsmanship is not accurate."

> [yonemitsu](https://twitter.com/yonemitsu/status/1698583086223794686) [yonemitsu](https://twitter.com/yonemitsu/status/1698583086223794686) [[craftsmanship]] I found a learning app in a tweet that says that if you make good products, they will surely sell even if propagation is slow, but they did not sell and will soon be withdrawn. I found it, so I downloaded it and tried it, but I was surprised at how useless it was. The [[self-assessment]] of someone who evaluates himself as a craftsman and says that is the reason why he can't sell is an unreliable pattern.
- [[The idea that "if you make something good, it will sell.]]

>  With people like Amiba, people who have so much ability and personality but can't become a lore master are spoken of as identical in the eyes of the public.
>  Say my name.

> [yonemitsu](https://twitter.com/yonemitsu/status/1698610558290071962) I want to spread the word about good works by saying they are good so that unfortunate good works will not be created (that's why I downloaded it). I downloaded it with the intention of doing so.

> [yas_kawamura](https://twitter.com/yas_kawamura/status/1698612163311788164) That's exactly what it is.
>  In my X profile, there is a phrase "movies that you can't hate", which is exactly what I call "hateful", referring to tasteful works that are not appreciated by the public as good but are hardly bad, but there are many games in this world that you can't hate, aren't there?

> [yonemitsu](https://twitter.com/yonemitsu/status/1698629825945313597) We need more reviews and critiques and a mechanism to deliver them for this purpose.

> [yas_kawamura](https://twitter.com/yas_kawamura/status/1698631376269181013) Yes, I agree.
>  If there is a reliable mechanism like peer review, it may not be vandalized, but peer review is also inevitably subject to bias if its reliability is perfect.
>  But better than nothing.
>  I would like to see some leverage to shine a light on good works that don't sell, works that don't appeal to everyone but are not hateful.
>  If left unchecked, everyone will not be happy.
