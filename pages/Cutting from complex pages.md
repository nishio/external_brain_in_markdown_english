Cutting from complex pages
- I'll try my best to verbalize what I thought when I cut out from the complex page.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - 1: "I'm deeply indented here, and I want to cut to the chase because I'm concentrating my talk on a potentially useful topic" (red, A).
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/8c39d706f08f9ad953b20010344104bd/thumb/1000)
    - 2: "If I just put this on a separate page, it won't make sense," so I'll duplicate the story up to the point where it appears, once in the foreground (blue, B).
            - [[Need glue allowance for cutout]] glue line was made once on the original page.

    - 3: Think "I need a title to put on this chunk."
        - That title is made from A, not B (Orange, C).

    - 3.5: (Added) Cut out at this time
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/7f8847f4c8a752988d0696cc3692af70/thumb/1000)
        - At this point, only the "new page title" C remains on the original page
    - 4: If it's just title C, it's just a keyword placed abruptly - I don't know what it means, so I'll add some content here to fill in the gaps (pink, D).
