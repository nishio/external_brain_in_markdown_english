title: "Insufficient study"
---

- When [[first penguin]] acts quickly and has learned his lesson and then decides not to continue based on what he has learned, [[laggard]] throws in a word that he sees as a failure in his decision.

They never say they have [[studied]] enough. Because they do not have the answer to how much [[study]] is [[enough]]. Therefore, their statements are [[zero information]], and it is [[illogicality]] to give [[attention]] to their statements.
