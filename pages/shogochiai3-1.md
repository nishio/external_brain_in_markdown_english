It would be something similar to the phenomenon that Yamamoto-san has indoctrinated so many people on Twitter, for example. Cypherpunk might be another one.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This tweet series focuses on language, technology, and concepts related to the understanding and representation of phenomena, such as "[[signifie machine]]" and "[[signifie tech]]."
- Signify Machine: "Signify Machine" or "[[Signify Machine]]" could refer to a mechanism or technology for producing and communicating symbols (signifiers) that have meaning. It has been suggested that this concept refers to the tools and systems that humans use to understand and represent phenomena. In addition, the responses to the question about LLM-equipped puppet robots suggest the idea that the generation and understanding of signifiers can be augmented by sensors and AI capabilities, but is ultimately based on human experience and criteria.
- Signifie tech: "Signifie tech" may refer to the process by which a particular technology or meme becomes accepted and popularized by people as a linguistic and cultural phenomenon. This concept suggests that technology is not merely a functional tool, but a phenomenon with social meaning and value. Furthermore, the suggestion that "signifie tech" is about [[raising the level of the state of nature]] indicates that such technologies have the potential to radically improve and extend human life.
- SIGNIFICANT TECH: The suggestion that avoiding "signifiant tech" can lead to a better way of life presents a critical perspective on the use of technology and its effects in modern society. It questions market-based innovation and emphasizes the importance of maintaining human standards and values.
- LLM and Signifiers: The suggestion that LLM cannot capture signifiers as phenomena themselves illustrates the limitations of LLM and other technologies to fully mimic human knowledge and senses. However, the services and products that this technology can provide have the potential to play an important role in capital markets.
