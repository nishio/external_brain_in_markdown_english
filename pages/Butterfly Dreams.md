> The dream of Zhuang Zhou was a butterfly. Butterflies are like this.
>  I am not aware of the "right mindset". I don't know Zhou. I suddenly realize that it's not a matter of knowing.
>  I don't know, Zhou's dream is for Butterfly and Butterfly's dream is for Zhou.
>  The Chou and Butterfly are necessarily separate. This is what is called mononization.
