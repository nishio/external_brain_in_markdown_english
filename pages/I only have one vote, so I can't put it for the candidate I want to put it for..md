- [[one vote per person]]

> [sunnova_downy](https://x.com/sunnova_downy/status/1809749288806948885) I voted in the Tokyo gubernatorial election. Although I would like to recommend Takahiro Anno for his policies, this time I voted for Renho, who has a good chance to win to end Yuriko Koike's bad policy.

> [abazurebitch](https://x.com/abazurebitch/status/1803883887795540213) You sound like you want Yasuno to win, but you want to drop Renho so you vote for Koike Yuriko.

> [hitoshi404](https://x.com/hitoshi404/status/1803222861265658251) If I had to choose anyone I liked from the bubbles, I'd put Sakurai-san or Yasuno-san in there myself.
>  If everyone does that, Renho will be elected, so I will just vote for Koike Yuriko, who I hate responsibly!

> [ksuk3_](https://x.com/ksuk3_/status/1800007751600574691) I want to vote for Anno, but I don't want Renho to win as a result.

> [10otsuRi](https://x.com/10otsuRi/status/1804506723119472784) Last time Utsunomiya won in the 23rd ward, but Koike got the votes in the city section and was eventually re-elected, and there's that.
>  I want to put my vote in for Ms. Anno, but I will probably vote for Ms. Renho because I want to stop Mr. Koike from being re-elected.
