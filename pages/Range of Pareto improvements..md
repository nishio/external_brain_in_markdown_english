    - Situations where there is a [[trade-off]] relationship between [[values]] X and values Y
- If the current situation R is not [[Pareto optimal]], any value can be improved without making it worse
- That improvement P is not set in stone in one way.
    - If there is only one decision maker and he/she chooses appropriately based on his/her personal values, it is still satisfied that "no one's values have been aggravated by anyone else's values".
- Being Pareto optimal is not a sufficient condition for being P, specific example Q1

- The [[feasibility frontier]] is expanding outward more and more with technological advances.
- So, past decisions will always be "non-Pareto optimal R
- Is there always more than one option for P to "improve" it?
- The choice from this p will not harm anyone.
    - Then is autocratic decision-making justified?
        - I don't think it's likely to be done.
            - (pending) by making decisions quickly and autocratically.
            - Making a decision narrows the scope of the next P
                - There is another layer of tradeoffs: a larger difference from the Pareto optimal state is a disadvantage, but having fewer decision-making options is also a disadvantage
