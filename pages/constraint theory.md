The key concepts of the Theory of Constraints ([[TOC]]: [[Theory of Constraints]]) are

    - [[constraints]] (Constraints): [[bottleneck]] or factors that limit the overall performance of a system. The [[weakest part]] of the system determines the overall capability.
- Five Focus Steps: A series of processes to identify and address constraints.
    - [[identify constraints]].
    - [[Make the most of constraints]]
    - [[making everything else subject to constraints]].
    - [[Improve the capacity of constraints]].
    - [[Return to the first step when the constraint is resolved]].
- Continuous Improvement: Continuously improving overall system performance by continuing to identify and resolve constraints.
    - [[global optimization]] : Emphasizes maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire system, rather than partial optimization.

The goal of TOC is to use these concepts to increase the efficiency of organizations and projects.

Maximizing constraints" means maximizing the capabilities of bottlenecks (constraints) that limit overall system performance and utilizing them without waste. Specifically, we optimize the operating time and resource usage of constraints so that other elements are not held back by them. In this way, we aim to improve the productivity of the entire system.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The bottleneck is a situation where reality is already touching the constraints, and there is no room to take advantage of it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Thank you for pointing that out. Indeed, the constraint is already a bottleneck and its [[Resources]] are [[at full capacity]]. By "maximizing constraints," I mean using existing resources more efficiently.

Specifically, the following methods may be considered
- Reduce inefficiencies: remove wasted work and downtime at bottlenecks.
- [Review priorities: Reorganize production schedules and flows around bottlenecks and focus on the most important tasks.
- Optimize auxiliary processes: supply the bottleneck with the necessary materials and information without delay [[so that the bottleneck can move without stopping]].
    - If the bottleneck is stopping, then it's not a bottleneck.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

The idea is to find room to improve performance at bottlenecks by reviewing the entire process and eliminating waste, even when resources are already being used to the limit.



<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is he saying something like, "It is a mistake to try to increase the availability [[of equipment]]?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that is correct. Theory of Constraints (TOC) states that simply increasing equipment availability is not always the right thing to do. What is important is to focus on the bottlenecks (constraints) in the overall system and make the best use of those constraints. Blindly increasing the utilization rate can lead to [[overproduction]] outside of the bottleneck, resulting in increased inventory and disrupted flow.

From the TOC perspective, any utilization that does not contribute to the overall system flow and performance is considered rather wasteful. The idea is not to optimize the utilization rate, but to make efficient use of constraints and improve the overall flow.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Are you saying that it is beneficial to identify bottlenecks that are already at 100% utilization and increase flow there, and that trying to increase the utilization of idle work equipment that is not at 100% utilization is not only unhelpful but harmful?
- [[Aiming for 100% occupancy is detrimental.]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, that is exactly right. Theory of Constraints (TOC) states that to improve [[overall system performance]], it is beneficial to focus on bottlenecks that are already operating at 100% utilization and increase their [[bottleneck flow]] (throughput). On the other hand, forcibly trying to increase the utilization rate of equipment that is idle other than the bottleneck is considered detrimental because it may disrupt the flow of the entire system.

The TOC approach focuses on maximizing its effectiveness by aiming for total optimization and concentrating on constraints.
