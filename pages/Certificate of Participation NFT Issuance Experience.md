> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1664149996361633797?s=20): [[visualization of contribution]] and [[visualization of participation]] experiments with [[unexplored junior]] community participants to issue "[[proof of participation NFT]]" for those who participate in the [[unexplored junior]] community.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1664153160188071936?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): I did the experiment a while back, but I haven't caught up on writing an article about the experience. For now, I just wrote that I did the experiment, the detailed story will come later.

I got it because it looked interesting when [[PluralityTokyo]] announced that I would receive an NFT certifying my participation in the event.
    - [[Certificate of Participation NFT Acquisition Experience]]

I talked about my interest in the publishing side at [[Social Hack Day #50]] and was able to experience the publishing side on the testnet.
- cost effectiveness
    - The market price fluctuates, so we cannot make any promises, but we are told that it is usually around 5-15 yen per case.
    - Cheaper compared to making and handing out stickers.
- Unlike stickers, it would be interesting to have developmental features such as "if you have it, you can do something" or "if you collect a lot of stickers, you can level up".
- I'm more inclined to publish realistically.

I got the OK from the leader, Mr. Ukai, to give out the participation certificate NFT at the Unexplored Junior event.
- If not, I was going to hand them out privately in the form of "proof that I met with Nishio."
    - Like [[Joi POM]].

Ask if you can use the image designed by [MugiSus](https://twitter.com/mugisus) and used as a Favicon in the Scrapbox of Unexplored Junior and get an OK.

# MATIC Preparation
.
The image and description are prepared, and when you are about to publish, you realize that you need to prepare the MATIC first.
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9279297db6001cb025f4.png)
- Actually, the biggest hurdle was preparing MATIC.

## Day 1
I had Ethereum on Coincheck, so I figured I could convert about $10,000 worth to MATIC.
- →No MATIC at Coincheck.

I looked into how to obtain MATIC, but could not determine which of the Google search results were credible information.
- report
    - Images and descriptions are ready.
    - I realize I had to prepare a MATIC when I tried to issue it.
    - I don't know how to buy MATIC, so I'll look into it.
        - 1: Articles found on the Internet
            - 1-1: An article about creating an account on an exchange (Bitpoint) where you can buy MATIC.
            - 1-2: Article that says buy XRP and exchange it for Bybit.
            - 1-3: Article on how you can buy with MetaMask, but your credit card company may reject it.
    - Try 1-3 -> I can't see the link to the purchase button (or can't access it from within Japan?)
    - I'm going to try 1-2 next, but before I do, I thought I'd better share all of this with you.

- Method 2
    - Route using [[JPYC]] pegged to Japanese Yen
        - [https://app.jpyc.jp/](https://app.jpyc.jp/)
        - Payment by bank transfer
        - They send tokens directly to your wallet address.
        - Exchange Matic for Matic on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [[Uniswap]].
- Method 3
    - Native's MATIC can be purchased at the exchange.
        - Sold at three locations, including SBI's.

## Day2
- I applied to open an account with SBI VC Trade.

## Day3
The account is ready.
- Deposit
- 10,000 yen for now

- Is Mizuho not eligible for support?
- I chose SBI Sumishin.

Use an immediate payment service
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b93275e524b001b90b499.png)
- What a convenient time we live in!
- (I thought again that I would stop using Mizuho for a good long while and focus mainly on places that are able to do new things like this.)

![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b93de68fd14001ca4cef3.png)
- I decided to buy a 75matic.
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b93ebd50be1001c90bab5.png)
- Bought.

I got as far as creating an account with SBI VC and buying MATIC.
- but I am stuck because I can't figure out how to send it to my wallet to use in MintRally.
- I can connect the "SBI Web3 Wallet" to MetaMask, and it shows NFTs, etc. there, but...
- Oh, okay, it's a layman's UI that doesn't show the menu for exchanging crypto assets by default.
- I switched to something called "Trader Mode" and got the "Crypto Asset Exit" menu (self-resolving).

Attempting to Exit Crypto Assets
- In order to dispatch a shipment, the destination must be registered first.
- Trying to register a delivery destination
    - After you finish filling out the form, you find yourself being asked for a second PIN.
    - What is a second PIN?
    - Need to set up two-factor authentication.

I was able to register the destination.
- I'm going to try to get only 1MATIC out of the garage for now.
- I received something called an "Outgoing Reservation Email."
- When you click on the link in that email, it will say "Your outgoing reservation has been accepted.
    - They'll email me when it's done, I'll wait.
- relevance
    - > From September 28, 2022, we will begin obtaining and storing information regarding the "purpose of the transfer" when customers newly exit (send externally) cryptographic assets in response to the Travel Rule.
    - > Please see below for details.

slow in coming
- SBI VC Trade] Reservations for delivery accepted 11:47 AM
- SBI VC Trade] Notice of Completion of Delivery 3:30 PM
- It's going to take me three hours.
- I was able to leave the warehouse.

Event Group Creation
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9513d75822001c3072ba.png)
- I'll pay you about 3 cents.

Error when trying to create event
- "insufficient funds for gas * price + value: address 0xd50... have 966546521347084996 want 11345890700340000000"
    - I see. 1MATIC is not enough.
- I have it set up to shoulder the gas bill (I pay for the gas and the recipient gets it free), but I mistakenly thought that it would be deducted from my address each time a pickup occurs, with no particular basis in fact.
    - No, they didn't. They paid in advance for the maximum number of people they decided on the first time.
        - At this time, they had 100.
        - I only put in about a dollar and they're trying to pay me about ten dollars, so that's not going to happen.

Make the number of issued cards 10.
- Error stating that it is still not enough
- It was late at night and gas was expensive.
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9801dea9ec001cecd2a7.png)
- [https://polygonscan.com/gastracker](https://polygonscan.com/gastracker)
- I'm going to leave the rest of the 74MATIC and go to bed.
    - Well, but if I had tried 75 MATIC from the beginning, I think I would have issued 100 cards without realizing how expensive gas was or that I had to pay in advance, so the learning curve was maximized.

## Day 4
11:00
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b98e0c58ab4001c5c7f86.png)
    - I see, less than half the price of yesterday.
- 24-hour graph

- Weekly graph
    - ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9901313b1b001cc658c7.png)
    - [https://livdir.com/polygongaspricechart/](https://livdir.com/polygongaspricechart/)
- I see what you mean - it's expensive at night.

10 cards issued
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b998dc75d27001c47332b.png)
- Paid 76 cents, gas cost 14 cents, total 90 cents.
    - It's just barely 1 MATIC on a regular gas bill, so it's no wonder it wasn't viable with the high late night gas prices.

An event page could be created!
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9a7fb3b062001babaf5e.png)

The NFT could be obtained from the event page!
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9a8eb978c0001b12056d.png)

[[OpenSea]] also shows it as an NFT that I own.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/f8e4737e338bd2cafe62210577b66f11/thumb/1000)
- In OpenSea, it is initially in "Other" and "Hidden".
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/647b9bb358113f001bb50f3c.png)
- 'Redisplay' so others can see it.

        - [[dogfooding]]
- Surprisingly, the service itself currently has no data (= everything is on the blockchain).
    - The fact that this kind of service can be realized with it is interesting, and I feel a paradigm shift.
