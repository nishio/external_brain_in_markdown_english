title: "Should→why?"

- 1
    - The "must" and "should be" statements can easily lead to thoughtlessness.
    - Why is that?" You may ask, "Why is that so?
    - #thinking #thought patterns #thinking

    - The assertion that "(reality) should be X" means that "in fact it is not X".
    - There is a [[gap]] between that observed fact and your personal belief that it should be X or that the state of being X is preferable.
    - So three "[[why]]"
        - Why is reality a NOT X situation?
        - Why is the state of being X preferable?
        - Why is there a [[gap]]?
    - They try to answer the question, "Why X?" with the simple statement, "Because Y."
        - But it's unnatural to have such a simple answer.
        - If there is a bug in a simple, small program, it can be easily fixed.
        - If it can't be easily fixed now, it's likely a more complex problem.
            - [[Words are one-dimensional]] and have limited expressive power. It is a problem with multiple elements that are intertwined in such a way that it is difficult to explain in words, and can finally be expressed by illustrating a correlation chart, etc.
