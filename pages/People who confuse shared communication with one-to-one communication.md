title: "People who confuse shared communication with one-to-one communication"
---

- Some people confuse [[Shared Communication]] with [one-to-one communication

- [[Disadvantages of e-mail-based communication]]
- The terms [[Shared Space Communication]] and [[mail-type communication]] were used in the

one-to-one communication
Communication that makes the recipient explicit, identifies the recipient, and is aware of the recipient
The writer has some expectation of the recipient.
- Expectation that the receiver will read, expectation that the receiver will react, expectation that the receiver will change his/her mind

This expectation is a kind of [[lust for power]] because it is a desire to control the behavior of others.

Differing assumptions about this communication style could cause miscommunication.
