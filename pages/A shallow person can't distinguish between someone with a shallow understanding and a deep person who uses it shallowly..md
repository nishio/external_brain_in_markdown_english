title: "A shallow person can't distinguish between someone with a shallow understanding and a deep person who uses it shallowly."
---

A person with a shallow understanding of a concept is using a concept in a shallow way, while a person with a deep understanding of a concept is using a concept in a shallow way, and a person with a shallow understanding of a concept cannot distinguish between the two.

People with deep understanding use [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], [[concept trickle down]] in a shallow way.

Shallow use by people with limited understanding is [[suggestion]], [[People who leap from one story to the next = vector search engines?]]

The idea of "cultural sphere" came to me when I linked "culture" and "sphere" in "cultural sphere" respectively and saw that the latter was connected to the meaning of "sphere" in the sphere theory.
- I ain't in the ballpark.
- People with a shallow understanding will find deeper meaning in what [[just happens to be a common string of notation]] and start thinking about the connection between cultural spheres and sphere theory.
    - The possibility that it [[might happen to produce something good]] cannot be ruled out.
    - So [[if people want to think, let them think]].
    - [[Fruitful thinkers create more value]].
