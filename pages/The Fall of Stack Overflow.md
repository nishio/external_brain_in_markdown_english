[[Stack Overflow]]
- It is interesting and fits the feeling.
- By the way, Vote and Post have been trending downward since before ChatGPT, and appear to have only accelerated a bit in the last few months.
- In other words, the percentage of ROM users who simply search and read without taking active action has been increasing over the past five years, and I think the appearance of [[ChatGPT]] has drastically reduced this number.
