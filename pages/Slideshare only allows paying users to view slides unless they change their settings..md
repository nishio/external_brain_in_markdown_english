- [[Summary of past presentations]]
- I used to put my presentation materials on [[Slideshare]], but nowadays I tend to make my presentation materials in Scrapbox, present in Scrapbox, and add questions afterwards.
- Slide presentation materials are difficult to add to due to the paper size restrictions of the slides, but Scrapbox allows additions without restrictions.
- Scrapbox can connect to other pages with links.
