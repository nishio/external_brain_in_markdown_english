title: "Happy if I can find a solution."
---

I had been thinking that "[[enthusiasm]] is a scarce resource" and "[[enthusiasm]] is necessary" for "a project that is producing results but then disappears," but I was unclear what that "enthusiasm" was.
I was able to explain the principle of project disappearance this time without using the vague concept of "enthusiasm.

- See any issue Y
    - Sometimes it looks like someone else Z is holding it, sometimes it doesn't.
- I think, "That should be solved with Method X."
    - Coming up with a solution = hypothesis
- Want to test that hypothesis ([[want to do]] occurrence)
- Try to make X
    - If Y is not resolved
        - Satisfied with "we know this method doesn't work" because the goal was to test a hypothesis, not to solve it.
        - Not necessarily another solution.
    - If Y is resolved
        - The solution I created solved the problem! Hooray!
        - If Z is known
            - I'm not really interested in whether the resolution of that Y makes Z happy.
        - If you don't understand Z
            - I'm not really interested in whether or not anyone will be happy by the resolution of that y

relevance
    - [[People who want to solve problems and people who want to test hypotheses]].
    - [[I don't want to make it, I want to know what's inside.]] I agree with the perspective that "wanting to know is the source of desire," and this is a variation of that.
- The flow of this explanation is clearly influenced by [[Nodal Point of Thought 2021 Unexplored Jr.]], but the inspiration was not in and of itself
    - It's like a series of considerations had parts floating around and they connected well.
        - [Solve problem Y with means X to make customer Z happy.
- Looking back again at what triggered it, I think it was the stimulus from the meeting we had in the morning.
    - It was a story about matching people with technical skills to organizations that had challenges
    - Even if the issue is clear and I am having trouble coming up with a solution, I personally am willing to go as far as "coming up with a solution," but I am not motivated to actually solve the problem, and I wonder why that is.
    - Perhaps it is because they have learned negatively from the experience that projects with this type of beginning often disappear: [[learned helplessness]].
    - To avoid that, it would be nice to have a clear Z.
        - One way is "Z is itself": [[Make something that meets your needs first.]]
        - Another way is to confirm the presence of Z early in the project and bring it to a state where you can observe that the solution is making Z happy
            - So avoid [[customer-neutral]].
            - Unlike in business, the customer in this case is not "whether they will pay" but "whether they will be happy."
            - The creator gets a sense of accomplishment by making Z happy.
