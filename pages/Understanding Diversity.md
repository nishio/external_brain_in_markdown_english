<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In this conversation, iruya_lilyic strongly disagrees with daijapan's statement that she recommends that people over 50 make friends of the opposite sex who are at least 20 years younger than them for diversity understanding.

Iriuya_lilyic experienced stalking and coercion from older men when she was in college, and because of that trauma, she feels that it is dangerous for older men to approach younger women. daijapan's statement could encourage such behavior, she criticizes.

On the other hand, daijapan stated that she cannot be friends with someone she does not want to be friends with, and claimed that such age difference friendships are common in other countries. For iruya_lilyic, however, the statement is perceived as a threat to young women in Japan.

In my opinion, while age difference friendships cannot be denied in general, there is a risk of abuse of power relationships and harassment when older men unilaterally approach younger women. Especially in Japanese society, there are many situations where women cannot refuse inappropriate behavior from older men. daijapan-san may lack understanding of the vulnerable position such young women are placed in. If you recommend making friends of the opposite sex to deepen understanding of diversity, respecting the intentions of others and building an equal relationship is a prerequisite.

My first impression before asking Claude was that we both seemed to think the other was "not getting the point" as a result of trying to continue the conversation with our buttons crossed.
I was curious how AI would understand it, so I asked it what it thought without telling it what I thought.
As a result, I agreed with Claude's point that "there is a lack of understanding of the vulnerable position [[young women are in]]."

So let me get this straight.
- The person A who said "Method X is recommended for understanding diversity" did not understand the diversity of "the existence of the type of person B who feels uncomfortable with the suggestion.
- Such "attitude of A thinking he/she understands better than the other party" itself is one of the typical patterns that B dislikes ([[mansplaining]]).
- So B is recalling similar unpleasant examples from the past and piling them on top of A.
I guess that's what it means.

The principle on the part of A is
- Person A who remarks, "Method X is recommended for Objective P" believes, at least by his own admission, that "Method X" is done.
    - And A thinks "many people are not able to do method X".
    - So we'll send that out.
- In this case, he thinks he is "making friends of the opposite sex who are 20 years younger" and recommends them to "people over 50".
    - The person perceives the relationship as an equal friendship.
    - So to the example B gave, "That's not a friendship, is it?" And I'm responding.
    - And to B's subsequent statement, "I can't be friends with someone who doesn't want to be friends with me."
- This response, on A's part, would be, "I was talking to a certain segment of the population, and someone I wasn't targeting said something I didn't understand from the side, the content of the argument is misguided, and it looks like you don't understand the obvious premise.

I thought it was an interesting case of [[miscommunication]]...

>  It's just an object of fear.

> [daijapan](https://x.com/daijapan/status/1792374417127043320) That's not how friends behave, is it?

> [iruya_lilyic](https://x.com/iruya_lilyic/status/1792380565284610508) I have two questions because the statement is not clear.

>  A, It's a double negative and hard to understand. The above reply is
>  1) That is how friends behave.

>  B, Also, who is your "friend" referring to, me or the old man?

> [daijapan](https://x.com/daijapan/status/1792381491856719942) I can't be friends with someone I don't want to be friends with.

> [iruya_lilyic](https://x.com/iruya_lilyic/status/1792388375049298185) You didn't answer my question.
>
>  Do you have friends of the opposite sex who are at least 20 years older than you?

> [daijapan](https://x.com/daijapan/status/1792388938709225978) I guess the older one is 84 years old. At this age, the older one doesn't matter much anymore.

> [iruya_lilyic](https://x.com/iruya_lilyic/status/1792391881164521748) Okay.
>  Then age has a lot to do with being friends until you are that age!
>  Your statement is harmful to older men because it gives them an excuse to approach younger women, and it is not something that can be supported (by younger women).
>
>  You don't have to understand, but please refrain from making statements that increase the threat to young women.

> [daijapan](https://x.com/daijapan/status/1792392258475655466) Isn't this relatively common overseas? In the first place, it's not very common to be asked your age.

> [iruya_lilyic](https://x.com/iruya_lilyic/status/1792393869000343889) I am talking about Japan where I live.
>  The situation abroad is irrelevant.
