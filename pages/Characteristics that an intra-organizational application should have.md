There are various [[workflows]] in the organization, "Individual A applies, and another individual B approves.

- Can Individual A check the progress status of the workflow?
- Can you view past workflows?
- Can searches be performed against the workflow?
- Can the workflow be shared with information other than those involved in the workflow?
- Can you communicate electronically about individual workflows?
    - Issues when discussed in venues not set up with workflow (e.g., chat, verbal, etc.):.
        - When you look back on it later, you don't know "why that decision was made".
    - Important to have a set of workflows and communication venues.
