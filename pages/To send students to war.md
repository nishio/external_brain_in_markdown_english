- To Send Students to War: Gen Tanabe's "The Devil's Kyoto University Lecture" reads
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2zw7ox3)
- The title of the book is radical, but of course the purpose of the book is not "to know what to do to be sent to war" but "to learn [[Dangerous Ideas]] in advance so as to acquire immunity, like inoculation with [[vaccines]]".
        - A book like a transcript of a class where [[Yu Sato]] goes to explain [[Tanabe Moto]]'s "Historical Reality" while having the participants of the event read it.
    - Examples of [[critical reading]] of philosophy books
- Gen Tanabe's bestseller, "[[historical reality]]."
    - Each life is finite, but if we die for the [[eternal cause]], we can [[live forever]]."

            - The kind often found in [[religious war]] and other places.
        - Very smart to get the idea of introducing a new "[[one's o]]"
            - [[Dying is a good thought.]]
- It's interesting to see the flow of irrational decisions that, in retrospect from this point forward, were justified by smart people.
- What was the benefit of Tanabe Moto?
- At that time, embassies of various countries were evacuated to Hakone and Karuizawa. The location of the embassies was communicated to the U.S. through the neutral country of Switzerland.
    - International wartime law prohibits air strikes on places where embassies are located.
    - Knowing this fact, households with money to spare moved in, and Hakone and Karuizawa became luxury resorts.
    - Gen Tanabe retired from Kyoto Imperial University on March 31, 1945, and immediately moved to Karuizawa, where he did not come down until after the war.
