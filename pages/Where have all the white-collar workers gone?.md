- from  [[New and required course "Information I" useful for work]]

This diagram is a simple depiction of the changes in the world, and it is not wrong as a "stripped-down" version, but there is one area where I think it is too stripped-down. The "people who were in the middle layer in the upper figure" who are the intended readers of this book have disappeared in the lower figure.

For the purposes of the book, I'm not trying to tell those people to go away because they don't need you anymore.
- Systematization is a transition over time, not 0/100, so those people "[[move]]" in the process.
- I'm wondering if this diagram doesn't convey that.

Where we are moving to:.
- 1: Systems Development (leading to the story at the beginning of this book where "[[Mandatory Programming Education]]" took place)
- 2: Work in the "[[interface with the world]]" part that is not directly systematized (bottom of the figure)
- 3: Entering the "know-how" arrow [[to extract and propagate information]] role
- PS: A few, of course, will move to "management."
