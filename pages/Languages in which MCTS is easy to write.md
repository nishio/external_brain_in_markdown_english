title: "Languages in which MCTS is easy to write"
---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> What is the easiest language to write [[MCTS]] in?
- It was hard to write in TypeScript (see below).
- (I get the feeling it's because you're trying to run it without blocking on the browser)
- Should it be written in Rust and Wasm?
- (I feel that if it runs on the browser, it will be easier to publish games with a little bit of clever game AI without setting up a high performance server.)
        - [[Game Engine in Wasm]]

He said it's important that the parallelism is easy to write if you're trying to be serious.
