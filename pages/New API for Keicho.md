title: "New API for Keicho"
---

- Enter bulleted text and add N questions
    - Subtle?
- In other words, use cases that don't come one line at a time like chat.
- We knew there was a need, and the "listen first" mode was still being used.
    - I want to enter a certain amount of stuff, no questions in the meantime.
- I can't keep typing the same thing over and over again."
- Bulleted text (all in the same hierarchy is fine) should be able to be entered.
- If I give you the Scrapbox URL, you can load it.
- That way, there's an incentive to keep the content you want to talk about repeatedly in Scrapbox.
- Write every "first question" properly.
    - Should I increase the emphasis of the keywords included in this?

- Instead of adding a new API, can we just read it when we type in the Scrapbox URL in chat?
