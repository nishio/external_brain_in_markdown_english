Peer Review
- Peer review is the process by which a research article or proposal is evaluated by experts (peers) in the field of research before it is made public.

Role:.
- To ensure the quality of our research, we rigorously evaluate the methodology, results, and arguments of our studies.
- Check the research for errors, inaccuracies, or ambiguities.
- Ensure that the research is consistent with existing knowledge and literature.

Replication
- A follow-up study refers to the process of conducting a already published study again under the same conditions to confirm the results of the original study.

Role:.
- The reliability of the results of the study is assessed by checking the reproducibility of the results.
- Ensure that scientific findings are consistent or not dependent on specific circumstances or conditions.

Peer review and follow-up examinations
- Peer review and follow-up examinations both serve as a means of enhancing the credibility and quality of scientific knowledge, but they differ in their approach and timing.
- Timing: Peer review occurs before the study is published, whereas follow-up review occurs after the study is published.
