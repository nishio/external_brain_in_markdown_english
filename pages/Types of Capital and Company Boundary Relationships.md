- Changes in the types of capital a company focuses on can affect its boundaries.
- When the focus is on financial and physical capital:
    - A clear boundary is created by a legal system that recognizes ownership rights for legal entities.
        - (When did non-natural persons begin to be recognized with ownership rights?)
    - The "company" owns physical assets and money.
- When the focus is on knowledge capital:
    - [[Knowledge Capital]] resides in the minds of individual employees and moves with them if they change jobs.
    - Current laws do not allow companies to forcibly retain individuals who wish to change jobs.
        - In the past, slaves were owned by their employers, but that's history.
        - Knowledge capital flows out not by the company's will, but by the will of individual employees.
    - Regarding capital acquisition:
        - For physical capital, companies could purchase machinery at their discretion.
        - Knowledge capital is difficult to acquire without the motivation of individual employees, even if the company desires it.
    - Capital flows in and out across company boundaries based on individual will.
- When the focus is on social relations:
    - Capital exists between people.
    - The metaphor of "accumulating capital within the company" becomes less fitting.
        - The strategy of "accumulating [[Social Capital]]" seems odd.
        - Productivity indeed increases if trust among employees rises, even within the company.
        - However, connecting externally as well as internally enhances productivity even more.
        - A strategy of expanding and connecting "social capital development."
    - The "[[Blurring of Company Boundaries]]" progresses further #organizational_boundary_blurring #boundary_blurring
        - Whether someone is an employee becomes less important.
        - Retirees may hold more social capital than new hires.
        - Maintaining trust with retirees is more beneficial.
    - Developing social capital is not limited to creating connections with one's own company.
        - Supporting others' connections can generate value.
        - This value returns as increased trust in one's own company.
            - [[How to Use Social Capital]]
    - It leads to a state where "the company doesn't exist."

- In reality, companies do not operate with just one type of capital.
    - Even companies that actively invest in building external networks and in motivated employees' learning use money, which is traditional "company-owned capital," as the source of these investments.
    - A system where three distinct types of capital interact:
        - Social capital contributes to improving the efficiency of acquiring knowledge and financial capital.
        - Knowledge capital contributes to improving the efficiency of acquiring financial capital.
        - Financial capital is necessary as a resource for actions to acquire other types of capital.
    - This creates an overlap:
        - Perspectives include focusing only on financial and physical capital, on financial, physical, and knowledge capital, and on financial, physical, knowledge, and social capital.
        - Accounting standards tend to focus only on financial and physical capital.
            - Equipment purchased with money is recorded as an asset.
            - Investments in acquiring knowledge or social capital are not recorded.
            - There are cases where cash flow is poor despite appearing healthy on the books after converting cash into equipment, highlighting the need to focus on cash flow as well as balance under current accounting standards.

The concepts that were not well captured 20 days ago in [[Mental Models of Companies, Evaluation Systems, and Engineers' Learning]] have been successfully revisited. Good.
