> It's very important to spend money to eat well, wear good clothes, spend time studying, and dive into different worlds before your mind itself gets old, so it's important to set a vision and invest in yourself rather than saving without a plan. Don't be a boring adult with little savings in your 40s.
> If we let things go, if we procrastinate, our hearts will age. To maximize our lifetime happiness, we must feel happiness when we can feel it most, and we must keep our hearts from growing old. Youth will last as long as we don't give up, and we must not grow old in a regretful, tortured way.
> I'm sure that after the Tokyo Olympics are over, those complicated adults who are trying to recapture their youth in their old age will continue to spend their lives at clubs in Roppongi, buying drinks for young girls and telling preachy stories.
> Don't think of things that only adults can do and things that young people can enjoy together. It's not a matter of money and time, it's a matter of timing and purpose. There are things that can only be seen when one has completed one's time, and to do that, one needs to be clear [[about what one wants to leave behind in this world]]. You have to think about it properly while you are young.
> Even if immortality is achieved, the mind ages.
> I like to do research because I believe that a sense of the future is the medicine for an aging mind that researchers fascinate us with. I like to ask the world about it. In the words of [[Nakaya Nakahara]], the indescribable high that you feel when you see the future is [[aspiration]] and [[youth]] itself. [Youth continues, and life is an adventure.
> The parameters of social despair and mental aging are indicated by the alcohol content of the alcoholic beverages that line the shelves of convenience stores. The alcohol content of the drinks we casually pick up is getting higher and higher, and the consensus of those who are going through life today is lined up on the shelves of the convenience stores. Even chu-hai is becoming a high alcoholic beverage these days, and we want to create hope in a mature society. No matter how old we get, the present is important.

> You certainly understand the feeling of "[[the mind]] getting older.
> "The feeling of the mind getting old" could easily be described as "the feeling of losing interest in things in general. Just as your body stops moving as you get older, [[your mind stops moving]]. Moreover, you may mistakenly think to yourself, "I know this and that. Or you may think like a sour grape. That's scary.
> Some people are afraid of embarrassment as they get older. I don't want to be like that. I want to do all kinds of things and be told by younger people, "Mr. Yuki, this is different. I want to be told, "Mr. Yuki, this is different. "Oh, I see! I see. I did it. I did it.
> I don't want to be ignored by younger people, and I don't want to stop being plugged in. I want to stay young at heart.
