title: "Group Size and Collective Decision Making"

[[group size]] and [[collective decision-making]]
When there is one, of course "one person decides" ([[dictatorship]]).
The time of two is special, and [[majority rule]] and [[unanimous]] are equal.
- I don't think there is much difference between two people talking and making a unanimous decision and one person making a decision after listening to the other person carefully.
I feel like when you get up to 10 or so people, one person should make the decision.
- Why is that?
- One person listens to N people to make a decision, O(N), and N people talk to each other, O(N^2), because the cost of the latter increases faster.
The problem starts to appear after 30 people.
- Because it would be too much for one person to ask, even if it is O(N).
    - When a majority of people feel that their opinions are not being heard or ignored, they begin to oppose the dictatorship.
- So we needed a mechanism to make decisions in a way that wasn't just one person.
    - One example of its implementation is majority voting.
    - Indirect democracy is one of them.
        - Assumption that elected officials will deliberate?
        - If so, then the limit is about 30 senators.

If "one person becomes unreasonable to listen" is a factor preventing one person from making decisions, then AI's enhancement of human cognitive abilities would increase the number of areas in which a dictatorship would be preferable.

Well, either way, at the level of tens of thousands of people, you need a non-human mechanism.
