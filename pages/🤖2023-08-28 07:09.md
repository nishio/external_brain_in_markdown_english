### Digest of Research Notes
.

I was supposed to write a diary yesterday, but sleepiness got the better of me.

### Relation to Fragment
.

Nishio's fragment "I didn't write a diary" and "[[side of well]] I have been writing [[diary]] for a while now and realized that I "didn't write a diary"" are relevant to my note. We both have in common that we had neglected to write a diary.

### Deep thoughts and questions

Why have we neglected to keep a journal? It may not just be because we are busy or tired. Diary writing is part of self-reflection, and avoiding it is also avoiding self-awareness. What are we avoiding by avoiding self-knowledge?

### Opinion
.

Writing a journal is an important tool for self-awareness and self-improvement. To neglect it is to miss an opportunity for self-improvement. We should maintain the habit of journal writing and set aside time for self-awareness and self-improvement.
