title: "Mission of the nameplate"

> A nameplate that requires you to turn over the contents under the nameplate every once in a while after you bind the pieces of paper is not a nameplate. It must be a nameplate that gives you a sense of what is contained in the package without looking at what is inside. ([[Continuing Ideas]] p.47)

- This is the reason why the nameplate has to be made strictly in the [[Beginning KJ method]]. On the other hand, in [[Expedition Net]] and others, the reason why they say "you don't have to make the nameplates strictly" is because they don't bundle them.
