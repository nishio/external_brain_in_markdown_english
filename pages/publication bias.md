title: "publication bias"
---

Originally, the story was "Only reports of success are reported in the paper, not reports of failure, so there is a bias toward assuming success.

I've seen all sorts of things related to this concept.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/mitoujr/nishio/icon' alt='/mitoujr/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It is easy to talk about in-house products, but difficult to talk about outsourced development.
- Only successful people's tweets get buzzed and communicated to a wide audience.
    - > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1578068284779663360): even if the success rate is 0.1%, if 1000 people try it, maybe 1 person will say "I tried this and it worked in one shot!" and it gets a lot of buzz. I tried it 10 times and all succeeded! and then the success rate will finally reach 50%.
- The vindictiveness of "I got a PhD but can't find a job" is easily tweeted, but "I got a job easily, didn't I?" However, people who think, "I got a job easily, didn't I?
