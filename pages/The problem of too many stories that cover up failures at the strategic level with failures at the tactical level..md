title: "The problem of too many stories that cover up failures at the strategic level with failures at the tactical level."
---

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1963760471812845569) The problem is that the Japanese like too many stories in which failures at the strategic level are covered up at the tactical level.

> [TraceOfEcho](https://x.com/TraceOfEcho/status/1963798218007032221) What is interesting is that stories that dare to assume strategic failure and overcome it with "individual talent" or "immediate response on the ground" are valued. I feel that this exudes a culture that places more value on decisions made in the moment than on long-term perspectives.

> [marsaogawa](https://x.com/marsaogawa/status/1963794537538883636) We are not a country that makes the rules,
>  I don't think the rules can be changed.
>
>  Yes.
>  He said that the strategic level is a constant,
>  Therefore, it is possible that they don't even consider it a failure!

> [Scientia_Vinces](https://x.com/Scientia_Vinces/status/1964252474149327198) This is probably not only Japanese, but people from all countries like it better as a story... strategically. The right way to win (more troops, better equipment, better logistics, in short, win by winning) is not so interesting...

> [Lazystr](https://x.com/Lazystr/status/1964007484684714389) Isn't it because "the story of a competent elite who thinks about strategy but never fails" is nothing interesting as a story?
>  "College professor walks down the street" is not news, but...
>  "University professor slips and falls on banana peel" is news. That's the difference.

> [MiffiyChikawa](https://x.com/MiffiyChikawa/status/1964136944926896271) In Japanese organizations, the people who formulate strategies often do not receive feedback from the people who develop tactics, and there is a lack of delegation of authority to the people who develop and implement tactics. This may be due to the fact that the Japanese organization has been drilled into their bodies that even if you question the premise, you will get stuck due to a lack of authority.

> [sefugirigiri](https://x.com/sefugirigiri/status/1963771229036503510) The longer you dither and can't decide, the worse the situation becomes.
>  Only after the strategic failure became too much, did they get their butts in a bunch and panic.
>  I try to make up for it, but by the time I get there, it's already too late.
>  The usual move of making a big play for an upset.

> [gloryhanta](https://x.com/gloryhanta/status/1963952525310378470) Because you don't distinguish between Tactics and Strategy in the first place (laughs).

> [darumaz](https://x.com/darumaz/status/1964151772869804280) In an analysis by a British military intelligence chief during World War II, he said, "The higher up the ranks you go in the Japanese army, the dumber you are. It is easy to take countermeasures because they only do the routine things that are in the pattern. Still, the reason the army hasn't collapsed is the cleverness of the underlings, who cover the stupidity of the top with their wisdom in the field".

> [molt_espressivo](https://x.com/molt_espressivo/status/1964247206975717627) It is actually quite disconcerting that postwar coming-of-age manga often portray the idea of the Pacific War, in which overwhelming material disadvantages are forced to be overcome through mentalism and gut feelings, as a positive success story. I am actually quite uncomfortable with the fact that postwar coming-of-age manga often portray the idea of the Pacific War as a positive success story.

> [urashima9999](https://x.com/urashima9999/status/1963970189948801528) Only movies can reverse strategic failures with individual tactical triumphs.
>  Grandfather: It is despair and hunger on the battlefield.

> [epi4129](https://x.com/epi4129/status/1964009858723909748) I don't know if they're all good people or not, but even with reckless instructions, they can get by on the spot with spirit and guts.
>  So, the range of "I can do this! and then one day, they suddenly go bankrupt.

> [n_jima_yta](https://x.com/n_jima_yta/status/1964188094430625865) That's because it's more dramatic for a story to turn around a strategic loser with tactics than for the strategically winning side to win outright. ...

> [kutai_5thcentur](https://x.com/kutai_5thcentur/status/1964224758561517932) Excuse the sidebar. Especially the 1942 South Pacific battle over Guadalcanal. Because some battles were won tactically, strategic defeats such as the failure of landing operations due to the sequential introduction of forces and the failure to recapture airports were covered up and verified after the war ... .

> [cccety](https://x.com/cccety/status/1963886196674994687) I installed this word from Dr. Matsuo of Tokyo University, I remember him saying it in a lecture somewhere.
>
>  I really think this is true.

> [tomo4nagashima](https://x.com/tomo4nagashima/status/1963933703060758593) It also fits with the reality of Japanese society.
>
>  I think there are quite a few industries that manage to hold their own only because of the excellence of their field force.

> [Kuronaka_1](https://x.com/Kuronaka_1/status/1964070536411324839) So people only want to see simple war results, so to speak.
>  So you love Pearl Harbor or Okeechobee.

> [AW9o1lUvo575767](https://x.com/AW9o1lUvo575767/status/1964169636695724040) because I love heroic tales.
>  For entertainment, a come-from-behind victory from a difficult situation is the royal road.

> [ndwater1](https://x.com/ndwater1/status/1964108557793829116) You might also like a story where the strategy proceeds by factoring in your own and your opponent's gaps and failures (like Death Note).
>
>  It will be fun to read the story from a perspective that distinguishes between strategy and tactics.

> [mutuno_kami](https://x.com/mutuno_kami/status/1964153436959887606) You say it's a success story of the Battle of the Sea of Japan type, but I wonder if it's not a traditional art since they surprised us in the Battle of Ichinotani in a 'take my example' state to begin with. I think it's a great reversal story and a universal favorite story of mankind before that.

> [keitoht](https://x.com/keitoht/status/1963955867289518085) That makes a lot of sense. But I think there are many stories like that. It's become a standard pattern that only a small group of people, including the main character, succeed while everyone around them fails.

> [syarinco](https://x.com/syarinco/status/1963952335308366130) I love how ingenious they are in fighting a losing battle!
>  It's not fun to look good when it's a digestive battle in a winnable fight.

> [rero_carnelian](https://x.com/rero_carnelian/status/1963982980369826015) Now if only there were no irregularities...

> [SwordAshNinja39](https://x.com/SwordAshNinja39/status/1963876343080214733) The so-called Hero's Law. If the system is mistake free, there would be little drama to begin with.
>  Maybe all mankind likes it?


> [dragoner_JP](https://x.com/dragoner_JP/status/1963985866336133395) I sometimes hear this "tale of covering up strategic-level failures at the tactical level," but I don't know what exactly you are talking about. How can you cover a failure at the strategic level at the tactical level? And if it can be covered, was it a story at the strategic level? The question arises, "How can you cover a failure at the strategic level at the tactical level?
>  >fladdict: The problem is that the Japanese like too many stories in which failures at the strategic level are covered up at the tactical level.


> [dragoner_JP](https://x.com/dragoner_JP/status/1964138907207160041) and strategy and tactics are described as dimensions or hierarchies, which translates differently from "operational coverage"...
>  >365yen: You are thinking too hard.
>  It's not uncommon for mistakes in design, specifications, and systems to be covered up in the field and in operations. x.com/dragoner_jp/st...


> [dragoner_JP](https://x.com/dragoner_JP/status/1964211116994941373) If Japan were to launch 20 million suicide attacks, they might be able to prevent the US forces from landing on the Japanese mainland, but I don't think it would be possible to "win".

> [dragoner_JP](https://x.com/dragoner_JP/status/1964258816012550286) Well, there used to be a commentary that Masanari Kusunoki's Battle of Chihaya Castle was a battle that led to a strategic shift in the battle at the tactical level, but this doesn't mean that a mistake was made at the strategic level or that it was covered up. It's not that there was a mistake at the strategic level, or that he covered it up.

> [aruma_zirou](https://x.com/aruma_zirou/status/1964081687777988914) I think the Legend of the Galactic Heroes is on Yang Wenli's side.
>  I like the pattern of heroes turning the failure of the whole thing around with their personal abilities.
- > [onishi_feuer](https://x.com/onishi_feuer/status/1964224914644173225) I know what you mean, but Yang himself said in his work that the failure of the strategic level cannot be compensated by the tactical level, and the Silver Age is realistic about that. So Yang is a good example of a man who won many tactical victories, but in the end was not able to turn the strategic level upside down.
- >  I think Suzaku Musou or Karen Musou from Geass would be better examples.

- >  You've turned the tide of the war.


> [onishi_feuer](https://x.com/onishi_feuer/status/1964222764933415367) I think the "story" the ex-pos is talking about is something like creation, exaggerated documentary, impossible instructions.
>  To give a concrete example, fantasy like Dragon Ball or Naruto, or similar impossible instructions in reality (of course, almost impossible to cover. The rest are really miraculously managed.)

> [KatzePotatoes](https://x.com/KatzePotatoes/status/1964000147156947169) In the beginning of "Guardian of the Empire", I think that there were many cases in which a reckless operation decided by a superior was carried out by an excellent field commander who thought about it so as not to cause casualties to his allies as much as possible. (Even so, the operation itself is still at a reckless level, so allies still die.

> [3sHedgehog](https://x.com/3sHedgehog/status/1964076663102230587) I sometimes wonder if it's not like Space Battleship Yamato and all the way through.
>  The pattern is that the enemy is completely outclassed at the strategic level, but Yamato is able to turn the tables with a series of tactical level victories.

> [Tomoaky88](https://x.com/Tomoaky88/status/1964091860760101056) I think you mean "talk about trying to cover up failures at the strategic level with failures at the tactical level".
>  The depletion of the Japanese army's resources at the end of the war was a failure at the strategic level (neglect of logistics, uncontrolled expansion of the front), but isn't that where the tactic of the suicide squads comes in, "trying to cover a failure at the strategic level with a tactical level"?

> [0203msato](https://x.com/0203msato/status/1964281821329534983) The Battle of Kisakihara (Shimazu vs. Ito), Battle of Okehazama (Oda vs. Imagawa), Battle of Kawagoe (Go-Hojo clan vs. Uesugi Kanto allied forces), Battle of Cannae (Carthage vs. Rome), Battle of Gaugamela (Carthage vs. Rome). The Battle of Itsukushima (Mori vs. Ouchi) is not mentioned because the Mori side lured the Persians into the battle.

> [yugokinokino1](https://x.com/yugokinokino1/status/1964259633884811726) If it is an ordinary general and 10,000 soldiers and Lu Bu and 1,000 soldiers, Lu Bu might win, but it is a strategic mistake to have only an ordinary general and 10,000 soldiers against Lu Bu. But it is a strategic mistake to have only an ordinary general and 10,000 soldiers against Lu Bu. Sometimes some people say that having more troops than your opponent is a strategic advantage, but since troop strength is only one factor, you have to look at it in a comprehensive manner. You can have more troops but no rations or morale.

> [katagatar](https://x.com/katagatar/status/1964299869339746456) First, there is the "story of how tactics got us out of a pinch," and then you just say "If we had a proper strategy, we wouldn't have had to go through all that trouble..." after the fact. I think.

>  I think this is the kind of story we are talking about.

He was asked if he could explain the difference between military policy, military strategy, strategy, and tactics.

> [nob_tun](https://x.com/nob_tun/status/1964277375597961514) If the tactical aspect is "a strong individual or platoon turned the whole thing upside down," then it's a strategy of training and deployment.

> [syarinco](https://x.com/syarinco/status/1964114378988671143) In games like Gangliphone, Earth Defense Forces, etc., you can win one mission, but it's only a small victory overall, and the next mission starts with you being surrounded by the enemy again. In the next mission, you start from the point where you are surrounded by the enemy again.
