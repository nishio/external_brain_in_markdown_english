title: "KJ method is HNSW"

from  [[Diary 2023-11-17]]
- The realization that [[KJ method]] is [HNSW

- [[Summary is an ambiguous concept]].
- So instead of a vague "summary" [[They put it in a jar and mix it up...]], I want to take it out and look at it concretely.
- That's where I was making concrete data unobtrusively.
- One of them was verbalized
    - Process for converting a two-page spread of a book into bulleted reading notes in Scrapbox
        - Various people have mentioned many times that [[itemization]] is more efficient than the de facto text format
            - [[outliner]] I guess you could say it's a bit of an "outliner".
    - Reading and compressing the contents of a book [[Leverage memo]], [[reading notebook]] target
- Since experiments with actual books cannot be placed in a public forum, I chopped up [[About Descartes' Philosophy]] from the Aozora Bunko at random and gave it a try.
    - Then I put it all together in a chapter and did a second level of compression.
- I was trying to figure out what would happen from here, and the hypothesis that [[the KJ method is HNSW]] came to mind.
    - Proximity is just the end of the line.
    - Basically, it is "the process of drawing lines between elements
    - Closest ones form clusters, which are built hierarchically...
    - That's very HNSW-ish.

Still just a messy analogy.
- I should read the paper [[Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph]] myself.
