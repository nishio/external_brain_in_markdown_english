- What was said in "[[Democracy in the 22nd Century]] Elections Become Algorithms, Politicians Become Cats" seems soooo appropriate now that I'm listening to the [[broad listening]] story.
    - Since the book came out before the ChatGPT festival, I feel that the content of the book was not well understood by the public.
    - The idea itself is [[fully automated unconscious democracy]] by fully automating [[broad listening]], but since ChatGPT had not appeared, it seems to have been evaluated as "irresponsible", "delusional", and "dreamer".

- [[10,000 Elected Nomads]]  p.144
    - [[nomad]]

- [[Free Private Cities]]  p.146
    - [[Schumpeter.]] 　 [[competitiveness]]  p.147
    - > It was [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy" (1942) who precipitated competitiveness as a desirable democratic characteristic. The most widely used arena of competition is elections.
    - → [[Assumption that democracy is about elections]]
    - > The essence of Schumpeter's argument was not the election itself, but the competition it created and the selection based on quality.
- Dahl [[pluralism]].
    - Making Elections Objective

- [[Competitive nature of the old state threatened by the new state through competition]]


[[Democracy without elections]]
- Elections" are downgraded from "the only channel for public opinion data" to "one of many channels.
        - [[Digital natives don't think that once-every-four-years upload bandwidth is enough.]]


I'd like to know more about the experiment on p.170.
- Objective external classification criteria are less important, and answers to subjective questions are the deciding factor in confidence in the ruling party.
    - If that's the case, then clustering can be done without taking sensitive external data, and we're getting closer to a [[Birdwatch]] kind of thing, aren't we?

Deregulation of general will
- Avoid dependence on one channel
- The [[ensemble learning]] metaphor

Problems with [direct democracy
- After all, it's "[[conscious electoral democracy]]" that forces people to pay [[decision costs]].
    - We can transfer it to an algorithm.
    - That's where [[unconscious data democracy]] comes in.
