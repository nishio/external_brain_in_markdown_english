- Minor acceleration
- For example, in an editor, it is faster to jump with search than to use the cursor keys to move the cursor.
    - For example, if you want to move the cursor to the "n" position in the string abcde..., you can do it with two touches of `Ctrl-s n` in Emacs.
- That in itself is true if you only focus on that narrow area, but how much of your life is spent moving the cursor?
- Pre-optimization profiling
- Compare the time you spend moving your cursor, looking for your missing smartphone, or reading a news article you don't really want to read as an escape from a task you know in your head you have to do but don't feel like doing.

- Concentration on an incorrect object
    - Compose for 30 minutes on an email that can be returned in 3 lines.
- Effort in an incorrect way
        - [[Efficiency of coin search]]
