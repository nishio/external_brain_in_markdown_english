title: "Pragmatism and Pluralism"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/> In [[James.]]'s [[pragmatism]], [[pluralism]] ([[pluralism]]) is a very important concept. He recognized the pluralism of the world and insisted on actively embracing it.

Pragmatism does not take a metaphysical position that seeks [[absolute truth]] or [[ultimate unity]]. Rather, it holds that the world is composed of diverse elements, which cannot be completely unified. In other words, the world has a complexity that cannot be explained by a single principle.

This multiplicity first manifests itself as [[diversity of experience]]. We experience a variety of sensations, emotions, and thoughts, which are not necessarily consistent. Pragmatism sees this diversity of experience as an essential feature of the world.

Pragmatism also recognizes [[pluralism of values]]. People have different goals and beliefs, and these can sometimes conflict. Pragmatism, however, does not hold any single value as absolute, but rather aims for [[the coexistence of various values]].

Moreover, pragmatism also insists on [[the plurality of truths]]. What we call "[[truth]]" is always dependent on a particular context and purpose. What is true in one context can be false in another. Thus, there is no absolute, universal truth, and truth is always pluralistic.

Thus, pragmatism asks us to acknowledge and embrace [[the plurality of the world]]. James believed that [[plurality is the source of the world's richness]] and also [[the condition of human freedom]].

However, pragmatism's pluralism is different from mere [[relativism]]. We can seek better beliefs and more useful truths through experience. Pragmatism, while acknowledging pluralism, insists on [[improving beliefs based on experience]].

Thus, in Jamesian pragmatism, pluralism is a central concept in our worldview. It asks us to acknowledge the complexity and richness of the world, while at the same time encouraging us to be pragmatic in our search for better beliefs.
