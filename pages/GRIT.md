> [@technohippy](https://twitter.com/technohippy/status/1656822448581660672?s=20): Just as the value of "remembering" has fallen a lot with the advent of the Internet and smartphones, the value of "thinking" with the advent of LLM may be losing its value. What will probably be left for the human race in the end is to "make [[decisions]]" and "take [[liability]]". In other words, what humanity will need from now on is grit. After all, it is [[grit]]! Boldness solves everything...!

    - Increasing the resolution of "thinking."
        - [[Part of it disappears, part of it remains, and a new one is born.]]
