Both Presidents Abraham [[Lincoln]] and Franklin D. [[Roosevelt]] employed strategies to incorporate opposing views in their decision-making processes, but they did so in ways that reflected the unique circumstances and challenges they faced.

Abraham Lincoln was known for his "[[team of rivals]]" strategy, in which he deliberately recruited individuals who had been his political rivals into his cabinet. This strategy not only ensured diversity of opinion, but was also a tactical move to consolidate support during difficult times during the civil war. Lincoln believed that the clash of diverse opinions would sharpen his thinking and decision-making, which he believed was critical in navigating the Civil War through the Union and ultimately toward the abolition of slavery (National Archives ).

Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt fostered an environment where differing views were encouraged among his own advisors. Particularly during the difficult years of the Great Depression and World War II, FDR's placement of individuals with opposing views required robust debate and ensured a multifaceted exploration of the issues. This approach not only helped shape [[New Deal]] policy, but also helped navigate the international complexities of the war years (The Socratic Method) ( Miller Center).
