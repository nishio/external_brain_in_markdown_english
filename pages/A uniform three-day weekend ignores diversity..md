title: "A uniform three-day weekend ignores diversity."
---

> For example, if you want to have a three-day workweek for a month, it is an act of imposing a uniform way of working without regard to "[[diversity there]]" where the optimal way of working is different for each employee. For example, if you have something you want to accomplish by the end of the month, you will be deprived of 20% of your work time, which is a nuisance. Ideally, people who want to rest should be able to rest when they want to rest. It is not [[Enforcement of rest]].

    - [[diversity]]
    - [[Imposing a way of working]]
- relevance
        - [[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status]]
