title: "Lapsed and smack dab in the middle of a bad play."
---

- [[One symptom of aging]]
Maybe we should split it up?
- Entering the market after the fad has died down.
- Doing what is already widely known as "bad" or "poor play."
- seeming proud for some reason
Is there a feature in the set of three?

Majority enters the market after the early adopter fad has died down, which in itself is commonplace.
It's common for newcomers who don't know much to make mistakes, and if you behave in a way that is perceived as if you'll listen to them if they pay attention, someone kindly ahead of you might pay attention to them.
By being boastful in that situation, you are perceived as a "cognitively deranged person" and no one pays attention to you because you are a pain in the ass, which creates a vicious cycle.
