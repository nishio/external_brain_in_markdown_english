<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/>[[James Moffett]] ([[James Moffett]]) offered an innovative perspective on composition education when he published Teaching the Universe of Discourse in 1968. His theory emphasizes the development of students' ability to write effectively in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes.

Moffett's main argument:
- Spectrum of Expression: Moffett viewed verbal expression as a continuum from monologue to dialogue, from internal thought to external communication. This empowers students to choose the appropriate mode of expression for different situations and purposes.
- Developmental Approach: He stressed the importance of structuring instructional content according to the student's stage of cognitive development. This allows students to progressively broaden their self-expression and develop the ability to effectively communicate complex thoughts and feelings.
- Mastery of a variety of writing styles: Moffett noted the importance of students experiencing a variety of writing styles, including narrative, expository, and persuasive, and understanding the characteristics and purpose of each. This allows students to choose the writing style best suited to their situation and purpose and to communicate effectively.

Moffett's theory aims to help students not only learn grammar and structure, but also to develop the ability to think through language and express themselves appropriately in a variety of situations. This approach offers an important perspective in contemporary composition education.

In Japan, research on Moffett's writing instruction methods has been conducted, and Saori Sadojima's serial article No. 7, "James Moffett's Writing Instruction," provides a detailed explanation of his theory and its practice.

Moffett's theory emphasizes the development of students' ability to write effectively in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes, providing an important perspective in contemporary composition education.
