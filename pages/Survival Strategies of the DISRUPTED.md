<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to discuss the survival strategies of players on the disruptive side of technological innovation by gathering specific examples from the past.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is a brief review of specific examples of companies that have been "disrupted" or faced the threat of being "disrupted" in the past, and a discussion of patterns of survival strategies.

Major Examples
1. kodak (from film photography to digital photography)
- Background: Kodak, which had a dominant market share in film photography, actually invented digital cameras early on, but could not get serious about them for fear of the impact on its existing business.
- Result: The company fell behind the wave of digitization and was forced to file for bankruptcy.
- Survival Strategies:.
    - Transformation into the medical and printing fields by leveraging core technologies
    - Secure revenue from licensing of patents owned

2. Blockbuster (video and DVD rentals to streaming)
- Background: While expanding its store network as a major video and DVD rental company, the company was slow to take action against online services such as Netflix.
- Result: Too much adherence to the existing business caused significant delays and bankruptcy.
- Survival Strategies (Failures):.
    - Attempted to launch an online business, but missed the timing and failed to build scale
    - Overall failure due to only localized measures such as independence of some franchise stores

3.Nokia (from feature phones to smartphones)
- Background: Nokia, the reigning champion of the cell phone era, was slow to respond to the smartphone market and lost significant market share to iPhone and Android players.
- Result: The mobile handset division was acquired by Microsoft, effectively withdrawing from the mobile business.
- Survival Strategies:.
    - Concentrate on enterprise solution areas such as telecom infrastructure and 5G networks
    - Utilization of patent portfolio and brand licensing business

4. IBM (from hardware to software and services)
- Background: The company boasted a dominant market share in mainframes and hardware, but its profit structure changed dramatically with the spread of PCs.
- Result: Hardware-centric business is sluggish.
- Survival Strategies:.
    - Major shift to software, consulting, and cloud computing businesses
    - Investing in Watson and other AI areas to develop new revenue streams

5. FujiFilm (from film to diversified business)
- Background: Affected by the shrinking film market as well as KODAK.
- Result: Sharp decline in demand for mainstay photographic film.
- Survival Strategies:.
    - Entering the cosmetics and medical fields of photographic technology application to open up new markets.
    - Generalize core technologies (colloid technology, nanotechnology, etc.) and deploy them in various fields

Main Patterns of Survival Strategies
- Redefinition of core technologies and assets and their diversion to new areas
    - Like Kodak and FujiFilm, we will apply the technology we have to other markets and create new sources of revenue.
- Business restructuring through spin-offs, divestitures, and alliances
    - Like Nokia, the overall survival rate of the organization will be increased by separating declining businesses and concentrating on areas of strength.
- Leverage intangible assets such as brands and patents
    - Kodak and Nokia will secure ongoing revenue through the development of licenses for their patents and brands.
- Internalization and absorption of innovations
    - An example of IBM's shift to a service provider by incorporating new technologies such as AI and cloud computing as its core.
- Leverage customer base to expand into subscription and peripheral businesses
    - As Netflix has differentiated itself by expanding its own production content based on video streaming, a business model shift that leverages existing customers is effective.

summary
The key to survival for players on the "disruptor" side is how to "re-use existing strengths in a different way" and "quickly change business models" in response to changes in demand and waves of technological innovation. It is particularly effective to redefine core assets (technology, patents, brands, and customer base) and rebuild business portfolios for new markets. Flexible business restructuring and collaboration with external parties are also important means of increasing survival.
