title: "aftertaste"

> [hbkr](https://x.com/hbkr/status/1829001377487695909) I've been thinking about Mr. Ochiai's term "[[bad]] aftertaste" since this morning. From the viewpoint of [[Japanese people]] who have a [[moral view]] that "[[the heavens are watching]]", "a bad aftertaste" may be more effective than being "condemned" head-on. It is like the case of "standing peeing has been eliminated after installing a small torii (gate) on the street.

>  Perhaps this is also related to the greatness and underlying strength of the Japanese people that Mr. Maezawa is talking about.
