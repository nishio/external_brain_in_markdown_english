title: "Comparing KJ method grouping to clay"

There is no "right way" to do this when you are trying to create new and interesting shapes by kneading clay.
Knead the clay to your heart's content, and if you can create new and interesting shapes, you have succeeded greatly.
If you fill an existing mold with clay, you will get a pretty shape, but not a new one.
