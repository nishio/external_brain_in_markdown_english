What is considered an achievement depends on individual [[subjective]] [[values]].
People with similar values tend to get together and form [[communities]].
- This is [[club]]-like

If you belong to the wrong community, the people around you will not recognize the achievements for you that you have subjectively created as good as they are.
- At this time, if you adapt to the values of the community, giving priority to being recognized by those around you as an achievement, in other words, you will not be able to live by your own values, which is painful

Being in a [[bazaar]] where people from different communities come and go, most people don't see value in what I see value in.
- Get used to people around you not appreciating your accomplishments because that's normal.
- Everyone around you has a different idea of what is good.
    - So I can live as I am without being influenced.
    - So some people [[are]] worried because they don't know what to follow.

- In the bazaar, some people find high value in trivial artifacts that they don't value.
    - You can trade in your crap for something more valuable.
    - On the other hand, there are people who will give you a bundle of something that is very valuable to them for a couple of bucks.
    - We gain from each other through exchange.
        - [[Win-Win]]

- If you're making certain trending deliverables in the bazaar in a light-hearted way, you're a "something shop".
    - People who find value in it will visit us as customers.
    - This makes it easier to live because you can create what you think is an achievement and then people will come to you who will find a higher value in it than you do.
    - Anxious until this state is formed.
    - Once formed, it is easy to misperceive as if it has always been there, but it collapses rather easily when society undergoes major changes.
