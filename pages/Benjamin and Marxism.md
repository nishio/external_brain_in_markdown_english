- [[Walter Benjamin]] is a thinker influenced by [[Marxism]], but he is not a typical Marxist. In addition to Marxism, his thought integrates diverse elements such as [[Jewish mysticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[Frankfurt School]] theory, and is therefore highly original.

Benjamin and Marxism
- Marxist elements
    - Critique of the historical view: Benjamin critically embraced the Marxist view of history (social progress through class struggle) and expressed skepticism toward the progressive historical view. His metaphor of the "[[Angel of History]]" ("[[Philosophical Thesis of History]]") emphasizes the destruction and sacrifices that occur in the name of progress.
    - A Critique of Capitalism: analyzed how capitalist society commodifies people's lives and turns culture and art into objects of consumption. In particular, his concept of "aura" is linked to the "commodification" of art through reproduction technology.

- Art and Politics
    - Benjamin criticized art's subordination to capitalism and explored the possibility that art could become an instrument of political struggle. In particular, he hoped that new technologies such as photography and cinema could enlighten the masses and become a means of opposing the ruling class.
    - His concept of "[[politicization of art]]," which examines the role of art in propaganda and enlightenment efforts, is grounded in a Marxist perspective.

Limitations as a Marxist
- Benjamin not only adopted Marxism critically, but also associated it with [[mysticism]] and [[utopian thought]]. In this respect, he distanced himself from orthodox Marxists.
- He also had theoretical conflicts with [[Adorno]] and [[Horkheimer]], fellow members of the Frankfurt School. Adorno, in particular, criticized Benjamin for the "excessive [[messianic]] elements" in his thought.

Conclusion.
- Benjamin is appropriately positioned as "an original thinker inspired by Marxism. Although he uses Marxism as one of his foundations, he has his own critical and multifaceted viewpoint, which is too broad to be simply called a "Marxist.
