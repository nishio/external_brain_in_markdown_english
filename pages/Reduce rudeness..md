title: "Reduce rudeness."
---

Summary: As we age, it is important to be aware of reducing our rudeness to others.
- As one gains experience, it becomes easier to recognize negative viewpoints, but one should be untainted by them and have a conscious attitude of reducing rudeness.
>  The more I look at (the world), the more my ego becomes steeped in [[popular opinion]], [[pessimism]], and [[the view of human nature as fundamentally depraved]].
>  That's because "the world is a naughty place," and if you're not careful, [[rudeness]] will increase on its own.
>  You have to be conscious enough to be less rude.


> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692584460183826446) As I get older, I think that I should be more careful to continue to reduce my rudeness.
>  No personal attacks (personality attacks), no hurling insults or expletives, no offending with sarcasm or sarcasm ......

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692585781544833057) I would like to repeat my assertion again and again.
>  "That was a bad decision" is a criticism that can be settled with "If the person admits and corrects the mistake, then there are no more questions".
>  "He does that because he's stupid" is a slander because [[even if you change it, it doesn't change your opinion of the subject]], and it doesn't move things in the right direction.

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692586619885478242) If people don't learn as a delicacy that the letters are spelled similarly, but "don't do anything stupid" and "don't leave it to this idiot" are as different as they can be, they can easily turn into a pompous, arrogant, overbearing monster of others.

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692588224747823274) (Looking at the roster of some administrative or legal reform expert meeting, etc.) Behavior such as "look at 00 (person's name) and shrug" seems straightforward and direct, but it is also not good.
>  I notice that the attention is shifting to the people who are participating instead of the specific issues for the future.

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692589100266840385) If you continue to use only "who you are" as the basis for judging right and wrong and superiority and inferiority in this way, one day you will not be able to honestly recognize even those who have achieved certain goodness and grace in front of you. If you continue to do so, and only use "who they are" as the basis for judging goodness, badness, and superiority, then one day you will not be able to honestly recognize even those who have achieved solid virtue and grace before your eyes.
>  Excellent achievements are not taken straight with various prejudices such as "young," "skilled," "unique to women," or "from a foreigner's point of view.

> [VoQn](https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1692590625970078109) The older I get and the more discerning I become, the more I see nodding pitiful stories, absurdities and indignant abominations, the more my ego is tainted with popular opinion, pessimism and sexism.
>  That's because "the world is a naughty place," and if you're not careful, you'll find yourself becoming more rude on your own.
>  You have to be conscious enough to be less rude.
