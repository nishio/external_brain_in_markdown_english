title: "CSV exported from Miro"
---

I got a CSV export to organize the discussion that was going on on Miro.
I finished looking through it, but the CSV didn't save any lines or spatial locations, so it was like "I shuffled the labels for the KJ method.
I reorganized it in Kozaneba, but it's now completely different from the original Miro.

That would be beneficial, but I think it would be a burden to go through the CSV export.
Gyazoing and OCRing each appropriate group seems like a good idea.
