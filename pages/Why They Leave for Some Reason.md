- Person B is simply moving towards a "higher mountain" (something more interesting, etc.)
- If Person A decides to act by thinking, "I don't know why, but since there are people going in that direction, I'll try going too," they can observe the new mountain with their own eyes.
    - [[Trade-off Between Exploitation and Exploration]]
- Conversely, if Person A starts saying things like "B is stupid for not finding value in the mountain I'm on" or "C, who is attracting B, is a fraud," it will tighten their own neck.
    - If Person A makes such claims, Person B will stop inviting Person A to new mountains or introducing them to Person C.
