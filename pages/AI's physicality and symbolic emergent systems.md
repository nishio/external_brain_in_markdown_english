[[AI's physicality]] and [[symbolic emergent systems]].
> [t_inamura](https://x.com/t_inamura/status/1637973712908738561) I think the mainstream view of ChatGPT is that "there is no [[corporeality]], so it is still in its infancy". His (her?) "body" is the Internet, his "brain" is the Transfomer and memory space, sensory signals are text information from humans, and the Actuator is a text generator (+display). We can think of Actuator as a text generator (+display).
> [t_inamura](https://x.com/t_inamura/status/1637973988403200000) Then, I feel that he is also a subject with his own body-brain-environment loop with a unique [[cyclic world]]. Yes, "environment" for him is the entire human race, and depending on the definition of "intelligence through interaction with the environment based on physicality," it may be possible that "[[intelligence based on physicality]]" in his cyclic world is established.
> [t_inamura](https://x.com/t_inamura/status/1637974208847429633) Inspired by @tanichu's statement that "[[the definition of physicality is important]].

> [tanichu](https://twitter.com/tanichu/status/1637979153617281024) > Symbols are not important because they have a discrete or grammar.
>  It's important because it can be generated and can be used to observe others.
>  And it transcends time and space as memory externalized by its expression.
>  Furthermore, there is arbitrariness and freedom in its interpretation, so it can be tuned at the level of society.
>  That is the meaning of symbolic emergence.
> [tanichu](https://twitter.com/tanichu/status/1637979698587385857) > I feel like we can finally get over the problematics of just internalizing language and everyone can go to the main problem of symbolic phenomena. > [tanichu It has been almost 20 years since I got the idea of symbolic emergent systems and started talking about language as an emergent system. Constructivism is finally going to reveal the emergent dynamics of language,.
