There are those who think, "People who have X shouldn't bother to say 'I have X.' There are those who think, "There is no advantage and there is a disadvantage of being jealous," and those who think, "People who have X should say, 'I have X,' because there is no harm in talking about it.

It was rather surprising. There are differences in models of human behavior.

A person who believes that "someone who has X should say 'I have X'" interprets the observed fact that "there is no one who 'has X' in his/her observation range" as "there is no one who has X."
- That's also a set of overgeneralizations that think the range of observation is all that matters.
