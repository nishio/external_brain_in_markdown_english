title: "People who blame those who don't read."

The books that man can read are only a small part of the whole.
- Let's say 1%.

Mr. B makes fun of Mr. A for not reading book X.
- The moment you make that statement, a 99x boomerang sticks into Mr. B.
- Mr. B introduces himself by saying that he is an idiot who doesn't understand that
- You don't even know that, which is why you make such statements.

- [[boomerang joke]]
[[Stupidity self]].
    - [[Visualizing Stupidity]]
