title: "Reading and the Train Parable"
---

If you don't read at all, you might as well stand still all the time, but if you read a lot and don't look back on what you've read, it's like taking a [[train]] ride through a tourist attraction

    - [[A book that should be chewed and digested well]]
    - Once it's in the stomach, it's not digested, and about six months later it comes back into the mouth at some point and ruminates (even if it's not pleasant).
    - [[Reading a lot makes you lose the ability to think.]]
    - [[reading]]
