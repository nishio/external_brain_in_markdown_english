title: "Adjusted game bias"
---

- What I thought when I was doing [[Doraemon's Dorayaki Shop Story]].
- In the everyday world, we think in terms of "[[Identify bottlenecks]] and get rid of them, other improvements are futile.
- But this is not the case in this game.
    - It's like doing three tasks that improve efficiency by a factor of 1.5, and multiplying them together to achieve a factor of 3.
    - for some reason
    - Games where identifying and improving bottlenecks can make a big difference in performance are difficult to balance.
    - Constrained by the desire on the part of the game implementers to control the overall storyline of the game
    - On the other hand, there are no scriptwriters in the real world trying to make the story of the development of human civilization interesting.
        - (There may be some religious people who think they are there, but I'll hold off on that.)
        - Individuals of Homo sapiens, which cannot share their intentions, randomly develop here and there, so there is always "one last piece" just before "something not yet connected" transitions to "a connected state", which creates bottlenecks.
    - The existence of people who "throw themselves (into an activity)" into [[Continuous Improvement]] / [[Sustained Improvement]] may have given birth to the strength of Japanese industry at one time, so I feel that criticizing this type of thinking without thinking is also something to be criticized. I feel that criticizing this type of thinking without thinking is also something that should be criticized.
- At first I thought it was a compact [[Management Games]], but this is not a good way to learn [[Management Perspective]].
    - Rather, it fosters [[uncritical workers]] who do all the work they see without discarding the work they see.
        - The [[game experience]] causes [[internalization]] of certain thought patterns.


relevance
    - [[Leveling up is a fool remedy mechanism.]]
    - [[The point is balance.]]
    - A thought that stretches each of the three in-game elements to 100.
        - [The game is a human-implemented world, so I want you to use the elements that you have spent money to implement.
        - There is no element of "using it would be detrimental, so it shouldn't be used at all."
    - Something like, "[[extreme swing]] to AGI, abandoning STR and DEF."
        - This will require [[decision-making]] at an early stage
        - Most people grow up in a balanced environment.
- We can start over.
    - It was implemented to get back the gift I gave to a customer.
        - Not in the real world.
        - When you think of it as a game, if you give an important item to the wrong person, you want to start over.
        - Entertainment is more important than reality.
