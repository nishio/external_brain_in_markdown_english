title: "UMAP visibility for the 2022 Upper House election"
---

2024-10-29
- The opinion vectors of each politician were extracted from the data of the 2022 House of Councillors election by [[Joint research by Taniguchi Laboratory, University of Tokyo and Asahi Shimbun]] and visualized by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method [[UMAP]] ( 592 respondents, 42 questions)
The clusters were specified by a person selecting a range of clusters, and the opinions that characterized the clusters were extracted by [[Fisher's exact probability test]], and a description of the clusters was generated by ChatGPT.
No information on political party affiliation was used for dimensionality reduction or for generating explanations for the clusters, but only for creating scatter plots to be shown to humans. The purpose was to observe the cohesiveness of individual politicians' opinions, not their cohesiveness as a political party.
The [[AI cluster commentary]] is created at the end of the process, but in this report it is written first for human clarity
