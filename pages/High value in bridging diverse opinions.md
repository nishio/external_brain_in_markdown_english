The following is a quote from Glen Weyl (Glen Weyl) in [[Meetup with Audrey & Glen]] about the treatment of "majority groups (large clusters) and minority groups (small clusters)" and its explanation in Japanese.

> Quotes (statement by Glen Weyl)
> “Maybe this cluster is a lot of people, maybe this cluster is just 10 people, but it doesn’t matter, because it measures the uniqueness of their viewpoints. And then we give the budget, we give the agenda setting, we give the reward to anyone who can propose statements that bridge those two clusters together … But if you count only by majority voting, then (the large cluster) already has the majority, so there is no incentive for them to think about the marginalized group. So it all depends on what you sort for. If you sort for only people’s headcount, then it just flows to the top. But if you sort by “[[bridge-making]],” and give longer bridges more bonus, then everybody or at least some people get into the mood of truly thinking about new ideas that bridge across very long distances.”

Commentary (Japanese)
- When large clusters (majority) are already outnumbered, simple majority rule is unlikely to create incentives to give consideration to "small clusters of small people (marginalized opinions).
- Therefore, visualization and clustering tools such as Polis and "Talk to the City" introduce a mechanism to evaluate not "how many people are saying the same thing" but "how well they bridge different opinions" ([[ bridging bonus]]).
- In a "majority vs. minority" structure, minority groups tend to be buried, but by designing the system to emphasize "[[bridging]]", the opinions of small clusters will not be overlooked, and the majority will have an incentive to work with "clusters of differing opinions". The majority also has an incentive to work with "clusters of differing opinions.
- As a result, the aim is to find more diverse combinations of ideas (i.e., to facilitate supermodularity and synergy) without the minority voice being ignored.
In short, by introducing the evaluation criterion that "not only the opinion with the largest number wins, but the person who bridges diverse opinions is the most valuable", the ideas and viewpoints of the minority group (small cluster) are not buried.
