title: "SNS fees"
---

> We don't feel guilty about using Twitter for free because as users, we ourselves are "[[goods]]" exposed to advertising. But someone is paying the cost of Mastodon and Misskey's servers. I have long wanted to take on this part myself if I want to push the future of distributed social networking.
[Set up your own Mastodon server with Masto.host | Lifehacking.jp](https://lifehacking.jp/2023/04/personal-mastodon/)

The [[usage fee]] of [[SNS]] is not [[free]], but the customer, the advertiser, was paying the cost, so if that is no longer the case, I will have to pay the [[cost of information dissemination]] myself...
