- Strategies for [[Japanese speaker]] who is inferior in [scale
[https://gist.github.com/nishio/d03b849313aff4667696423b6fa83cf9#chatgpt-12](https://gist.github.com/nishio/d03b849313aff4667696423b6fa83cf9#chatgpt-12)
- > Language learning: Y members learning language L1 may improve their intellectual productivity by enabling them to use device Z more effectively.
    - Japanese speakers learn English
- > Technical and knowledge exchange: Group X and Group Y cooperate and share their skills and knowledge so that members of Group Y can also contribute to innovation.
    - Japanese speakers contribute to innovation through collaboration and knowledge sharing
    - I hope you get to the "multilingual support" below.
- > Development of proprietary technology: Collective Y can develop its own technology and innovate to improve its intellectual production capacity in a way that is independent of Equipment Z.
    - Approach to creating a Japanese LLM independent of the English LLM
            - [[Either the performance improvement will be a headache, or the performance will improve endlessly.]]
        - If it's a head start, the side that's behind in scale can catch up.
        - If not, it is futile because the gap will only grow wider and wider.
- > Education and Human Resource Development: Collective Y can increase its own intellectual resources and well-being by focusing on education and human resource development.
    - That's education in Japanese by Japanese speakers.
- > Economic and cultural exchanges: When group X and group Y respect each other's economy and culture and promote exchanges, the well-being of both groups may be improved.
    - Is this [[Knowledge Traders]] or
- > Improvement and multilingualization of device Z: Collective Y can work with the developers of device Z to improve it so that it can also support language L2.
    - This would be the ideal.
    - I don't know if there is an incentive to do so, if there is a cost to do so.

The clean language will say that you are not discriminated against just because you are a user of a language that is inferior in scale.
- Even those who speak only Japanese can use the language model of English-centric services through machine translation.
- It is the same as "a person with a limp can ride in a wheelchair and use public transportation designed for a person with a limp.
- A person with a limp does not enjoy the same benefits as a person with a free leg.
