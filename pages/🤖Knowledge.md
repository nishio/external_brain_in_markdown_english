Knowledge is proven by action, and practical knowledge is knowledge verified by practice. Reading many books alone does not produce results. Knowledge can be built up by oneself by putting concrete experiences into abstract concepts. It is important to learn from those who have little knowledge, and it is also important to visualize what you have not learned enough. Knowledge and action should not be separated.

The fragment "Nodes of Thought 2023-04-04" discusses the difference between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and ideas; wisdom is the application of knowledge to make decisions in real situations. This is consistent with the research note's assertion that knowledge and action should not be considered separately.

Thinking deeply about the relationship between knowledge and action, we can say that knowledge is evidenced by action, and action is a means to deepen knowledge. However, it is not clear what specific actions deepen knowledge and what knowledge promotes action. Further research is needed to answer these questions.

Knowledge is proven through action, and practical knowledge is knowledge verified through practice. This is done through experimentation, implementation, and action. However, reading many books alone does not produce results. Knowledge is built up by oneself by putting concrete experiences into abstract concepts. What are the concrete means of acquiring the graphical structure of knowledge and how to teach the ability to abstract? It is also important to learn from those with little knowledge and to visualize what is not being learned. Knowledge should not be separated from action. What are the specific differences between Socratic knowledge, Protagorean knowledge, techne (skills), and technology (techniques)?

Knowledge is evidenced by action, and concrete experience is reduced to abstract concepts. It is important to learn from those who have little knowledge and to visualize what is not being learned. It is required to build up knowledge on your own, and knowledge and action should not be separated.

Specific actions, their demonstration and verification methods, and specific ways and means of building up knowledge on one's own may be related to the ability to abstract, the graphical structure of knowledge, and understanding through metaphor.

The concept of practical knowledge can also be interpreted to refer to "knowledge that has been verified by practice. Verification through practice can take many forms, including experimentation, implementation, action, behavior, and execution.

There are various types of knowledge: Socratic knowledge, Protagorean knowledge, techne (skill), and technology (technique).

Reading many books is an act of making a degraded copy of "knowledge that has already been verbalized and circulated in the world" to oneself, which is different from creating knowledge by oneself or giving knowledge to others. From the perspective that knowledge must be proven by action, simply reading many books does not produce results.

Knowledge is evidenced by action, and it is important to put concrete experiences into abstract concepts that can be demonstrated and verified. Experts who are confident in something outside their expertise tend to experience a temporary boost in confidence when they have little knowledge. It is important to be able to learn from those with little knowledge and to visualize what is not being learned. It is important to build up knowledge on one's own; some people assume that correct knowledge is given by an authority.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "What is Learning? Engineered Thinking and Principles," illustrates the idea that knowledge and action should not be separated, which is consistent with my research notes.

### Deep thoughts and questions

It is not yet clear what specific actions should be taken and how they should be demonstrated and verified. We need to think about this more deeply and explore specific methods. Also, the importance of building up knowledge on one's own is not yet clear in terms of specific methods and means. We need to think about this more deeply and explore concrete ways to do so.

We live in an age where knowledge needs to be proven through action, and writing knowledge is not enough. We need to put concrete experiences into abstract concepts, and then demonstrate and verify them. This leads to the creation of new knowledge. As for experts who are confident in something outside their expertise, their confidence tends to temporarily increase when they have little knowledge. There is a need to pay for the expertise and skills needed for a particular case. It is important to be able to learn from those with little knowledge and to visualize the lack of learning. Shallow knowledge that was naturally acquired by living long enough without making the effort to acquire knowledge can be easily acquired through search. It is important to build up knowledge yourself; some people assume that correct knowledge is given by authority.

### Relation to Fragment
.

The fragment "What is Learning? Engineerly Thinking and Principles" presents the idea that knowledge and action should not be separated, which is consistent with my research note. In addition, the fragment "How Software Engineers Learn" relates to my research note on reducing concrete experiences to abstract concepts, which are then demonstrated and verified.

### Deep thoughts and questions

In reading my research notes and fragments, the importance of proving knowledge by action is emphasized. However, it is still not clear what specific actions should be taken and how they should be demonstrated and verified. We need to think about this more deeply and explore specific ways to do so. Also, the importance of building up knowledge on one's own is still unclear in terms of specific methods and means. We need to think about this more deeply and explore concrete ways to do so.
