Many people seem to vaguely hold this concentric circle-like image. The assumption is that the knowledge children possess is a subset of the knowledge adults have, that what children can do is a subset of what adults can do, and that the skills children have are a subset of the skills adults possess.

However, when engaging in such discussions, it is not a fair comparison to make the child's side a specific individual while keeping the adult's side as a vague group. If you make the child's side specific, the adult's side should also be specific. Let's say, for example, "you."

What actually happens in reality is more like the diagram below.

Have you ever written a project proposal and succeeded in a competition with over nine times the applicants? Have you ever implemented and released a smartphone app on your own? Have you ever proposed and implemented a new idea that even experts couldn't find flaws in? Have you ever made numerous phone calls to secure the resources necessary to achieve your project?

There are indeed younger people who have accomplished things you haven't. Clearly, the concentric circle image is incorrect.

Even among adults, it is not uncommon for differences in expertise to result in situations where "someone is skilled at something you cannot do." If you are a 30-year-old programmer, would you say to a 25-year-old designer, "It's amazing you can draw at 25"? Would you say to a 28-year-old entrepreneur, "It's amazing you started a business at 28"? Wouldn't you consider that disrespectful?

What would be considered disrespectful to say to a 25-year-old is no less disrespectful to a 15-year-old. This is implicitly [[discrimination]] based on age. You just haven't realized the prejudice within yourself.
