title: 'A sense of "this is the right evolutionary direction."'

- I wonder if there is a better name for this "it's the right [[direction of evolution]]" feeling.
    - There is no "sure-fire way to target [[innovation]]," but that does not mean that "all challenges have an equal probability of leading to innovation. What is the difference?
- It may be like an "aesthetic sense" that grows by absorbing many examples of correct evolution (= successful and widespread change) in the past.
- Programmers should be able to distinguish between "[[good design principles]]" and "bad design principles".

- A sense of "this is the right evolutionary direction."
