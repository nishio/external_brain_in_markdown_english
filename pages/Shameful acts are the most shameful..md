title: "Shameful acts are the most shameful."
---

> When you write a sentence, you should assume that everything will be exposed. Lies will be exposed. You will be found out if you stretch too far. If you cut corners, you will be found out, and even the wittiest of tricks will be found out as tricks. When you write an elaborate sentence, you need to accept the embarrassment of being exposed as an elaborate sentence. There is nothing more embarrassing than writing without shame.
