1. conducted a comparative study of [[anonymity]] in computer-mediated communication (CMC) between Japan and the West.
2. the results showed that Japanese CMCs tended to exhibit higher levels of anonymity than Western CMCs. Japanese users tended to prefer one level higher in the anonymity hierarchy model.
3. about Internet forums:
        - - Japan's "2channel" allows complete anonymity; there is no equivalent in the West.
        - - At Slashdot, 57-69% of Japanese users were completely anonymous, compared to 21-25% of English users.
4. social networking sites (SNS):
        - - On MySpace, 51-60% of Japanese users used avatars, compared to 12-24% of American users.
        - - On the Japanese SNS mixi, 83-95% of users used avatars.
5. the authors question the simple cultural dichotomy of [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]] as an explanation for this phenomenon. This is because some research findings challenge the conventional hypothesis regarding this East-West difference.
6. other factors that influence anonymity preferences include site-specific microcultures, [[privacy]] concerns, interface design, cell phone culture, and socioeconomic background of users.
7. notes that the site's reward-punishment system may be more important in predicting behavior than the level of anonymity alone.
8. the authors call for a comprehensive study that examines broader variables within and between cultures, rather than relying on broad generalizations from East to West.

In conclusion, although clear differences in anonymity preferences were observed, the authors avoid simple cultural explanations and advocate more detailed research on this topic.

Yes, I will explain in more detail why we avoid interpreting this as collectivism.

1. questioning conventional hypotheses: 1.
The authors of this paper question the interpretation of the Japanese preference for high anonymity in CMC as simply a sign of "collectivism. This challenges the long-standing and widely accepted assumption that East Asian cultures, including Japanese, are collectivistic while Western cultures are individualistic.

2. meta-analysis results:.
The authors cite a meta-analysis of 83 studies that assessed individualism (IND) and collectivism (COL). This analysis found that while Americans had higher IND than many countries, surprisingly, they had higher COL than the Japanese.

3. reliability of the measurement scale: (1)
In studies using high reliability measures, American COL was higher than Japanese, and in studies using low reliability measures, the two were about equal. However, many cross-cultural studies used low reliability measures, which may contribute to the general view that Japanese are more collectivist.

4. construct validity: the
These results call into question the validity of the construct concepts in measuring cultural individualism and collectivism. In other words, it is unclear whether these concepts are truly measuring exactly what they are intended to.

5. intra-East Asian differences
The same meta-analysis also showed that the COL of Koreans is comparable to that of Americans and that of Chinese is much higher than that of Americans. This shows the danger of lumping all "Orientals" together.

6. consideration of other factors:.
The authors argue that factors other than individualism vs. collectivism should be considered when explaining anonymity preferences in CMC. For example, they cite the microculture of a particular social networking site or forum, privacy concerns, interface characteristics, the influence of cell phone culture, and the socioeconomic background of users.

7. the need for a more comprehensive approach.
The authors advocate a more comprehensive research approach that takes into account a wider range of variables within and across cultures. They believe this will allow for a more accurate understanding of anonymity preferences in CMC and avoid simplistic cultural explanations.

In short, the authors warn that a simple cultural dichotomy of collectivism vs. individualism to explain differences in anonymity in CMC risks oversimplifying a complex reality. Instead, they recommend a more detailed research approach that takes into account more diverse factors.
