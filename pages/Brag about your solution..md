title: "Brag about your solution."
---

In educating newcomers
- They're reserved when you say, "[[I don't know.]] Listen to what I have to say."
- Tell me when you find something troublesome and I'll brag about my solution! I'll brag about my solution technique!"
- Everybody's talking about it.
    - It's like a [[game]] where if you [[boast]] each other and your opponent knows, you lose.
