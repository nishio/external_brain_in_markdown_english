- The other day, when I talked about how interesting it would be if all the metaphors in astrology, tarot, etc. were converted into data and subjected to principal component analysis, I thought it was interesting enough, but then I thought about the philosophy book "The function of human consciousness is that the subjective encompasses the objective, in other words, consciousness is a 'place' that encompasses the object" (Kitaro Nishida). (Kitaro Nishida), which I interpreted as a bunch of metaphors, and I thought it would be interesting if I converted them into data and conducted a principal component analysis.
- It's an interesting stop, but even more interesting.
