title: "Two Lines of Why and How"
---

There are two ways of thinking when the ideal is X but the reality is not X
- "[[why]] not X?"
- "[[what can I do?]] Can you do X?"

Q: Isn't digging into the why a way to X?
A: Wrong. Digging deeper may result in something unchangeable.
- The condition that "why" leads to "how" is that it can be attributed to something that can be changed and retried.
