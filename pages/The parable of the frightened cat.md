title: "The parable of the frightened cat"
---

- The [[scaredy cat]] bristles its fur, tries to make its body look as big as possible, and makes loud, aggressive shearing noises.

People who try to make themselves look as big as possible and make loud, [[offensive]] statements are like frightened cats.

#Parable

- [[Real-life frightened cat]]

> An article in the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported a story about a thug-like man who bumped into a businessman on the train.
>  The man was yelling at the businessman so hard that the older woman quickly said, "It's okay, you scared me. He won't do anything, don't worry. She rubbed the man's back and he cried.
> The woman was a teacher at a support school and the man yelling at her overlapped with the panicking student, and she acted unintentionally. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who just don't realize it and need support, but they've grown up as they are.

- I don't know if it's a true story or a creation.
