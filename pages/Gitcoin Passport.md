[What is Gitcoin Passport? - Gitcoin support](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/what-is-gitcoin-passport)
> Gitcoin Passport​ is an identity verification application. We have written software enabling people to grow personal ledgers of verifiable credentials about themselves and organizations to assess their identities to coordinate rights and responsibilities. Users collect “stamps” from different authenticators around web2 and web3, such as Bright ID, Proof of Humanity, Twitter, and Google.
>  Gitcoin Passport acts as an aggregator of decentralized society credentials, proving your trustworthiness without needing to collect personally identifiable information. This process transmits more Sybil resistance out to the entire ecosystem.
>  While we are building the Passport agnostic to specific applications, we are actively exploring its benefits for personal proofs and plurality in organizational designs.
(DeepL)Gitcoin Passport is an identity authentication application. We have developed software that allows people to create a personal ledger of verifiable certificates about themselves and allows organizations to evaluate their identities to align rights and responsibilities. Users collect "stamps" from various authentication agencies around the web2 and web3, including [[BrightID]], [[Proof of Humanity]], Twitter, Google, etc.
- Gitcoin Passport serves as an aggregator of credentials for a decentralized society, proving trustworthiness without the need to collect personally identifiable information. This process allows more [[civil tolerance]] to be disseminated throughout the ecosystem.
- We are building a Passport that is application agnostic, but we are actively exploring its benefits for [[Plurality]] in personal certification and organizational design.

With just the Ethereum activity history, the Score only went up to 3.23.

It says, "We won't admit you unless your score is 15.

Maybe I should try to tie in Twitter? I've got over 5,000 followers.

- But I tried it twice and got no response both times, maybe a problem on the Twitter side.

Try tying it to Google to isolate the problem.

Simple!

Success!

But it didn't score much, because, well, a Google account is so easy to create.

I look at what other means are available to me. Oh, there's Github.

This one also meets all the requirements.

I did the Github two-factor authentication and asked, "Do you want to pass on public data?" I got a confirmation screen that said

They were recognized as human beings!

I thought I'd have to connect with [[BrightID]] or something, but there's been enough online activity so far that they've accepted me as human.

Open it on your PC and read the QR code with the BrightID app.

- It said it would take time.
- Oh, it's done.

- Unique Humanity Score did not increase...
    - Is it because it's a freshly made BrightID?

17.50 with Facebook tied in.
24.80 with Twitter tied in.
