Is the prediction market like a futures market?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>They are similar in that they both involve the buying and selling of contracts for future events, the prices of which represent the expectations of market participants. However, the essence of futures trading is "transfer of price risk," while the essence of prediction markets is "probability estimation through information aggregation" - the purpose, clearing method, and regulatory framework The purpose, clearing method, and regulatory framework are very different.

Request to write about calculations
- If I were to write a book now, what would it be, and I decided that society is about calculation.
- Overall, we're talking about society, using computer science concepts such as "widening the bandwidth of IO" and "pure functions have the same output if they have the same input."

Will the voice of those with money be louder in the forecasting market?
- It depends on the theme whether it is better to be or not to be.
- The market is basically a system where those with money have a louder voice.
- Deciding by one vote per person is a mechanism to prevent those with money from having a louder voice.
    - Instead, the minority is suppressed ([[tyranny of the majority]]) because the voice of those with strong opinions and the voice of those with weak opinions are the same one vote.
- Q: Allow minorities to be disadvantaged or allow the rich and poor to be disadvantaged
    - A: The action against the rich-poor gap is a mechanism of "[[redistribution]]" that takes private property from those who have money and distributes it to those who do not have money. This is not good.
        - Postscript:.
            - The "how much to take from whom" part of redistribution should not be QF because when money is a voting right, it moves in the direction of not taking from the rich.
            - The "how much to give out to whom" part is like, there's nothing wrong with using a QF where if you try to choose an option that only a few people will benefit from, you'll have to pay more than you'll benefit from it.
            - > QF has the same say whether 100 people pay $100 or 1 person pays $1,000,000.
                - This could be called "equality in the amount of compensation for those who don't come to the conclusion they want."
    - On the other hand, using it for all policy decisions puts minorities at a disadvantage.
- Q: What if everyone has the same amount of chips and we distribute them and vote on them?
    - A: That's Quadratic Voting!
    - QFs that increase voting rights based on the "amount of donations" rather than handing out a fixed amount of votes.
    - This is also a good amount of grant for OSS in the form of [[Gitcoin]].
    - Postscript:.
        - I'd like to add that I was too brief when I talked about "what if we gave a certain amount of voting rights" to the problem of strong minority opinions being crushed by the tyranny of the majority.
        - Audrey's simplified Quadratic Voting gives out 99 votes, which is better for expressing the strength of your opinion than having only one actual vote.
        - On the flip side, if you get 99 votes when you vote and lose value if you don't vote, even those without strong opinions have an incentive to act and say "what a waste, let's vote", which is a weak solution to the tyranny of the majority.
        - To solve this problem, the tokens used for voting must continue to have value after the election, and there must be an incentive for those without strong opinions to "save them for the future"
        - The quickest way to achieve this is through Quadratic Funding, where "money is a vote".

Predictive markets are not likely to solve the problem of public goods being destroyed.
- I'm sure that's true in the current forecast market alone.
- When you make a predictive market for venture investment, spending on projects that have the potential to succeed in the future, you create an incentive to invest money in creating a public good that is beneficial to you.
    - Public goods investment in QF or [[Retroactive Public Goods Funding]].
- I'm talking about carbon credit trading to acquire the cost of preserving forests, a public good.
        - [[LINE Yahoo and Owase City Sign Agreement to Purchase and Sell Forest-Derived J-Credits for 10 Years]]

- I'm starting to feel that we need to do a better job of talking about the QV and QF area, since the forecast market alone is not enough to talk about public goods investment.
    - QF fits the purpose of investing in a public good that many people will benefit from, since 100 people paying 100 yen and 1 person paying 1 million yen will have the same say.
