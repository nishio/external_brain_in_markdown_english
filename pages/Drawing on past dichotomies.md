- 1: I thought A and B would [[confrontation]] in the past.
- 2: A or B is not a point, but a set of concrete examples
- 3: As time goes by, new examples emerge.
- 4:
    - People associate new cases with close cases.
    - The boundaries of A and B are not clear.
        - This process spreads unconsciously.
- 5: A new C appears.
    - C is A or B?
        - This is [[fruitless (resultless) debate]].
    - Conflict was slowly lost as the boundaries widened.
    - The idea that the dichotomy of the past continues is itself an assumption that is not grounded in reality.

concrete example
- Pass-by-value and pass-by-reference: [[pass by reference]].
- Compile and Interpreter Methods
- Flow vs. stock type: [[Flow/stock is a false dichotomy]].
- Job-based and membership-based: [[Membership-based or job-based employment is a false dichotomy]].
- Work and Life: [[work as life]].
    - [[0-origin or 1-origin is a false dichotomy]]

relevance
    - [[False dichotomy]]
    - [[Trade-off between two attributes]]
    - A story about how destroying the assumption that two attributes are a trade-off can lead to new ideas.

[[old dichotomy]].
