title: "To what extent do we criticize the ideas obtained and where do we terminate them?"

Q: To what extent do you take the seeds of discovery that you have been led to critically and to what extent do you redo them yourself? To what extent do you want to bring it to a conclusion?

A:
    - Let's take a look at [W-type problem-solving model
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/390334994715674be46fc76dfc2c7989/thumb/1000)
    - [[KJ method in the narrow sense]] is the "idea" part of C to D
- The hypothesis obtained here is tested in a later phase, not in the KJ method (G→H)
- Criticizing with your head in the KJ method stage is nothing more than a desk theory, so you should quickly finish the KJ method, act on the hypothesis, and learn from the results!
