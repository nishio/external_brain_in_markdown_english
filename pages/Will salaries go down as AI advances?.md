Will salaries go down as AI advances? I've casually talked about just one pathway to the question, but I think this is something worth considering in detail. Suppose people are earning 1 income for 1 effort with 1 outcome. What would happen if some of them started producing 3 outcomes for 1 effort?

First of all, those whose workload is measured by effort (and time spent at the company) do not get paid more. Those whose workload is measured by the value they produce will basically triple their income, but with an important factor of "dependence on the company's resources. What this means is,
People who are 100% dependent on company resources and can't create value without them get paid very little. Even if they are treated that way, there is no danger of them changing jobs.
Those who are not at all dependent on the company's resources will triple. However, this assumes that there are enough buyers. If not, overproduction will drive prices down.

What is interesting here is that the tripling types often say that they would rather have something other than money than triple the money.
You start earning 1.8 by generating 2 value for 2/3 time, and spend 1/3 of your leisure time with your family or on hobbies, for example.
At this time, there is a bit of dumping going on as a barter for pushing one's own convenience. The person doing it doesn't care because his income is increasing enough.
The type of person whose hobby is value creation is even worse. They create 1 value in their leisure time and give it away for free.
Thus prices collapse as those who are more productive live better, and the income of those whose productivity remains the same falls.

> [kuro_shirty](https://x.com/kuro_shirty/status/1892954696408834199) I agree with the first half of this, but would disagree with the second half.
>  In a 3x output world, it is hard to believe that a salaried labor force exists that is being dumped 1/3 of the time for the same salary, while at the same time a business can exist that increases income by 3x for productivity (= no dumping at all).
> [kuro_shirty](https://x.com/kuro_shirty/status/1892960462163083269) If you imagine a world where output is not tripled but labor costs are 1/3 of what they would be,
>  If clothes can be produced cheaply in China, domestic production with high labor costs will decrease.
>  Three times the output, so three times the quota for the same pay! As long as there are companies that work at the same rate, I don't see how other freelancers and such can stay at the same unit production cost.

Specifically, the following are ambiguous
1.### Supply-demand balance in the overall market
.
    - Even if a high-productivity (3x output) worker can freely set the price, if there is enough other labor to "take on 3x output at the same salary," the market price is likely to fall.
        - In order to maintain high wages for only some, there must be a "reason why many other players cannot achieve the same level of productivity" or "differentiated value," but the explanation is insufficient.
    - 「[[需要が満たされて初めて、雇用は減少し始めます。]]」だよ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

2.### How technology/resources are disseminated
.
    - In order to "triple income for those who are not dependent on company resources," there must be advanced AI, skills that are exclusive to a limited number of people, or special customer needs that can be monopolized.
        - But in many cases, the spread of technological progress (AI) itself can easily make the same thing possible for everyone, which drives down overall wages.
    - 特殊な顧客ニーズを独占できるこれは確かにそう。「 [[A world where social capital is king]] 」だね。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

3.### Dumping (free distribution at leisure) and high wages
.
    - It is unclear how a structure that "distributes the fruits of one's leisure time for free to lower the market price" while "receiving triple the wage for oneself alone" can exist in the same market at the same time.
    - I see, this "[[単一の市場]]」や「 [[balance]] 」を前提にしているわけだな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In short, the first half of the argument describes a situation in which "those who receive high performance compensation" and "those who receive only the same compensation as before" exist side by side when productivity is extremely high due to AI, etc. However, the fundamental problem pointed out by the second half of the argument is that it lacks an explanation of ### how the equilibrium will change when these two groups compete in the same market
. However, the fundamental problem pointed out by the latter half of the paper is that it lacks an explanation of how the equilibrium would change if these two groups were to compete in the same market.

Explanation for this

from [[The End of Programming as We Know It]]
- > [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1893108639260647770) What humanity in 2022 reads as "programming" is broken down into three segments, A, B, and C. Demand for A is being met by AI, B is becoming more efficient, but supply is still insufficient, and C is demand is increasing. Overall, "we are not yet at the stage of declining employment," but for those who stick with A, declining

- Those who think in terms of a single market or equilibrium view the market for "programming" jobs as (1)
- However, in reality, as shown in (2), what used to be referred to by a single word "programming" is now divided into three parts, A, B, and C.
    - Over time, demand for A almost disappears, B also decreases due to efficiency gains, and C increases significantly
- > It is unclear how a structure that "distributes the fruits of one's leisure time for free to lower the market price" while "only one's self is paid triple the wage" can exist in the same market at the same time.
    - The discrepancy here arises from the discrepancy between (1) and (2), and the free distribution of results made in one's spare time by someone who derives revenue from C does not necessarily eat into the demand for C, but rather into the demand for A and B in terms of ease of doing so.
    - From the opposite perspective, it's harder to do, which is why C is so inflated.
