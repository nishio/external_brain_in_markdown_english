title: "Need a human resource enrichment algorithm"

- We need not only [[Human Network Building Algorithm]] but also [[Talent Enrichment Algorithm]].

- [Human Network Building Algorithm
- Wide information search range
- Prevent exploitation by selfish players
The purpose of the project was to

After the network is established, information on good human resources should flow through that network, and an algorithm is needed to naturally generate a "high concentration community" with a concentration of good human resources.
- It should not be a centralized system, because the center will be corrupted.
    - Power corrupts.

- This mechanism itself could serve as an incentive.
    - [[human network construction algorithm#5a46602aaff09e00001060f6]]
    - This is because they gain greater benefits by belonging to a more concentrated community

- Instead of explicitly banning people who are not beneficial, create a new group with only beneficial people.
    - I thought this was the basic approach.
            - [[Natural extinction instead of explicit destruction]]
            - [[Move the good stuff.]]

- How [[dual community]] works in the open source community
    - Open, low-barrier-to-entry organization that allows anyone to sign up for mailing lists, etc.
    - Be an active member of the community
    - Gradually becoming well-known within the community for the results of its activities.
    - Then recruited by organizations with high barriers to entry, such as committers and other "not everyone can be one" organizations.
        - [[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]]
