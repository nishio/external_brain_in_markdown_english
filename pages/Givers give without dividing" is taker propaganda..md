    - Relationships in the world are not a give and take, but for the most part, "don't have a relationship, cut a relationship."
    - There's a difference between "givers give to everyone they have a relationship with" and "givers give to everyone they have a relationship with."
        - And there are really very few people who can do the latter.
        - Even if he is sharing his wealth with all Japanese, if he is not sharing it with impoverished children in Africa, he is giving only to those he arbitrarily chooses, not "all people".
