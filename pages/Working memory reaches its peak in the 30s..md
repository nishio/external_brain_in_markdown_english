Working memory across the lifespan: A cross-sectional approach
- [(PDF) Working memory across the lifespan: A cross-sectional approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3/icon' alt='o3.icon' height="19.5"/>This study is a representative basic study in our field, simultaneously examining the developmental curve and structure of working memory (WM) across ages 5-80 years using a large cross-sectional data set of N = 1 070 individuals.

1 Background and Objectives
- The purpose of this study was to compensate for the fact that conventional developmental research has been biased toward children and adolescents and lacks data on older age. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach))
- The research questions are (1) the amount of change in WM levels with development and aging, and (2) examining the structural controversy of whether WM is "function-specific (retention vs. manipulation)" or "domain-specific (language vs. space)". ([Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2012.748027?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[ResearchGate https ://www.researchgate.net/publication/279417312_Working_Memory_Across_the_Adult_Lifespan?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])

2 Participants and Methods

2.1 Samples
- The general population of 1070 persons aged 5-80 years (almost equally divided between men and women) was stratified into 8 age groups (5-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-59, 60-80 30-39, 40-59, 60-80 years). ([ResearchGate [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach?utm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach?utm) _source=chatgpt.com], [UNF Digital Commons](https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/unf_faculty_publications/2783/))

2.2 Measurement
- Six tasks were extracted from the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA),
    - Language WM: Digit Recall (retention), Non-word Recall, Listening Recall (manipulation)
    - Visuospatial WM: Dot Matrix (retention), Spatial Span, Visual Patterns (manipulation)
All assignments converted to standard scores (M = 100, SD = 15). ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach), [UNF Digital Commons](https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/unf_faculty_publications/2783/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Differences between age bands and factor structure were tested with a multigroup covariance structure analysis (CFA), comparing three models (1 factor / 2 factors of function / 2 factors of domain). ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach))

3 Main Results
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/fb85fd3b91db3ebcc984611fc6ff5d88/thumb/1000)
- Language WM was maintained in old age, with 70-80 year olds comparable to teenagers, whereas visuospatial WM declined to pediatric levels. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X20300048?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

A much different story spreading on social networking sites.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The only part of the article that is presented in a radical way is "visuospatial WM has been reduced to the level of a child."
- Interesting that the language WM is maintained.

3.2 Factor Structure
- CFA Conformance:.
    - Domain segmentation model (2 factors for language and visuospatial) best fit (CFI = .98, RMSEA ≈ .14). ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach))
    - Functional categories (retention/operation) are not supported, suggesting that "which area is more decisive than which operation". ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.789816/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3.3 Additional Findings
- Covariates such as gender and years of education have no statistically significant effect, and age and domain are the main effects. ([scholars.unf.edu [https://scholars.unf.edu/en/publications/working-memory-across-the-lifespan-a-cross-sectional-approach?utm_](https://scholars.unf.edu/en/publications/working-memory-across-the-lifespan-a-cross-sectional-approach?utm_) source=chatgpt.com])

4 Significance
1. reassessment of aging tolerance
    - The pattern of protection of language WM over visuospatial is consistent with the neuroscientific finding of a left-hemispheric dominant "language network resistant to aging". ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7314411/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. education and intervention design
    - Supported the significance of incorporating WM training during the rapid growth phase of childhood, and suggested that the "visuospatial system" should be reinforced in older adults' interventions. ([Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2012.748027?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[SpringerOpen https ://ejo.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43163-025-00806-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])
3. contribution to the model controversy
    - It strengthened the view of WM as "language + visuospatial resources" rather than "capacity + processing" and served as the theoretical foundation for subsequent network analysis research. ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.789816/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X20300048?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5 Limitations and Criticisms
_
| Item Content |
| -- |
| Design Cross-sectional study, so intra-individual variation cannot be tracked, and the inclusion of generational effects cannot be ruled out. ([ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach]) |
| Issue Selection Restricted to generalization between variants because WM measures other than AWMA and processing speed and IQ are not included. ([ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach]) |
| Smaller number of subjects in the older age group N 70-80, possibly slightly lower power. ([ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271673579_Working_memory_across_the_lifespan_A_cross-sectional_approach?utm _source=chatgpt.com]) |

6 Subsequent research and practical implications
- An attempt to simultaneously measure age-related changes and brain structural indices (anterior cingulate cortex thickness and white matter connectivity) in a longitudinal study is underway. ([The Times [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/friendship-not-fitness-linked-to-sharp-memory-in-later-life-lxkc6xjrl?utm_source=](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/friendship-not-fitness-linked-to-sharp-memory-in-later-life-lxkc6xjrl?utm_source=) chatgpt.com], [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929321000876?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- In classroom interventions, instructional methods that reduce WM load, such as "diagramming what is heard" and "presenting in short multisensory blocks," are recommended. ([Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2012.748027?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[SpringerOpen https ://ejo.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43163-025-00806-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])

summary
Alloway & Alloway (2013) simultaneously demonstrated (1) rapid growth in childhood, peak at age 30, and slow decline in old age, and (2) domain-specific structure of WM, making us reconsider the common belief that "aging = rapid decline". Despite cross-sectional limitations, the research continues to have broad implications for education, clinical practice, and neuroscience.

> [@kohaken_dsl](https://twitter.com/kohaken_dsl/status/1522699476409802752): There is a guideline for the number of instructions that can be understood at once, depending on age. Of course, this is just a reference as it varies greatly from person to person, but at 5-6 years old, for example, two instructions are considered the limit.
> It is better to refrain from giving too many instructions at once, and to devise a way to say more than three at a time, or to write them down ^ ^.

> The aim of the present study was to extend previous lifespan research to a wide age range (5 to 80 year olds) and investigate any potential differences in the development and decline of working memory functions. To that end, measures of both verbal and visuo-spatial working memory were included in a cross-sectional study. The findings indicated that there is considerable growth in childhood–on average 23 standard points; with performance peaking in 30-year olds. There was relatively little change in working memory performance in older adults, with 70 to 80 year olds performing at comparable levels to teenagers (13–19 year olds) in verbal working memory tests. Confirmatory factor analyses suggest that working memory skills across the lifespan are driven by domain differences (i.e., verbal or visuo-spatial stimuli), rather than functional differences (maintenance and manipulation of information).
