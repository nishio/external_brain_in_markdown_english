title: "Importance of exchange in the problem-solving process"
---

- [[Problem-solving]] bridges the gap between the ideal and the current situation, and [[information exchange]] is an important part of the process.
- Solution methods become obsolete as the status quo changes.
- Problem solving bridges the gap between the ideal and the status quo, and as that status quo changes, so do the methods of problem solving.

Clarification of resources and objectives is important.
- As specific questions arise, new methods are needed to solve them.
- When the "obvious solution" is not being implemented, it's better to ask "why not?"

### Digest of Research Notes
.

We discussed the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process. Problem solving bridges the gap between the ideal and the current situation, and the exchange of information during the process is important. However, as the current situation changes, solution methods change and the original solution becomes obsolete.
- I see,[[Information exchange is exchange]] ということか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

We also discussed resource allocation strategies. Clarity of resources and objectives is important, and [[I'm going to change as much as I can,]] just as [People who make a difference are happier. However, since the resources that can be invested are not infinite, thought stopping is sometimes unavoidable.

In addition, we looked at examples of problem solving and verbalized the process of problem solving. As specific questions arise, new methods are needed to solve them.

Also, when the "obvious solution" is not being implemented, instead of insisting, "It should be ____!" instead of insisting, "Is there a reason why it's not being ____?" I thought it would be better to ask, "What's the reason why it's not being done?

Finally, we reiterated the point that when the status quo changes, solution methods become obsolete. Problem solving bridges the gap between the ideal and the status quo, and when that status quo changes, so do problem-solving methods.

From Nishio's research notes, "Decomposing the Problem," "The Problem is the Gap Between What It Should Be and What It Is," "Problem Solving Compendium," "Linear," "Typhoon Hoax," "Problem Solving Examples," "Hatena2015-01-07," "Solution Methods Become Obsolete When the Status Quo Changes," "Solution Methods" and other fragments are considered relevant.

Taken together, these fragments provide a deep understanding of the importance of information exchange in the problem-solving process, resource allocation strategies, the problem-solving process, solution implementation, and obsolescence of solution methods.
