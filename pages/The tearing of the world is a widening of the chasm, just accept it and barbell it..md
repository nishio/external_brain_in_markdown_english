- [[Torn of the world]] is an expansion of [[chasm]], not a phenomenon unique to this [[LLM revolution]].
It's just easier to understand because this time it's noticeably bigger.
No one knows whether the chasm will remain expanded and not return, or whether it will eventually shrink.

In this situation, those on the [[early adopter]] side are frustrated that the majority is not following, and their mind wonders which is the right choice. The [[Barbell Strategy]], which allocates resources to the two extremes, is a good way of saying "[[choosing the]] right two options.

postulate (in debate)
    - Isn't [[legitimacy]] determined by [[majority]]?
