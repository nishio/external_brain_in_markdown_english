When your head is [jumbled up
- When it's a network of "this and that are related, right?" and it doesn't become a smooth [[unidimensionalized]] [[story]].
- First, you have to get that "[[relationship]]" out of your brain and into an "[[indelible]] state.
- Then, by looking at it as an object, we can treat it "at a distance ([[associate]])" and "[[having a bird's-eye view]]".
- When you are only thinking in your brain, your thoughts and yourself are in a unified whole, so it is beneficial to separate them from the subject by making them into objects ([[objectivization]]). ([[separation of religious ritual and government administration]])

in other words
- [[Keichobot]] urges us to make words ([[symbol]]) out of [[foggy]], which is not yet a word.
    - Clarify the "relationship" by asking questions about the relationship between its symbols.
    - Lots of "relations" would be "[[jumbled up]]."
- [[Kozaneba]] helps objectify the relationship and make it a one-dimensional story

- The [[KJ method]] was a method of objectifying "relationships" that had not yet been verbalized by taking them out of the brain in the form of "let's put them near each other because there seems to be some relationship.
- Bundling with [[doorplate]]" was an after-the-fact process of looking at "[[seem relevant]] things" and putting "relationships" into words.
- In the words of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning," this means that the collection of [[RELEVANCE]] has encouraged the verbalization of [[felt sense]] (= an unverbalized feeling that something is relevant).
- In Kozaneba, the existence of a relationship can now be made explicit by "[[draw a line]]" regardless of proximity.
    - Therefore, it is now possible to "structure the existing [[Existing Structure]] in a different way while making use of it," which was not possible with the KJ method.
            - [[Why are lines essential?]]

relevance
    - [[mix up]] @ [[Waiting task]]
    - This is not a mess meaning there are lots of relationships.
