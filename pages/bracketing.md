title: "bracketing"
---

In Scrapbox, keywords in a sentence can be enclosed in brackets ` [ ] ` to make it a link in the project. This is the most important notation.
Both external links and text decoration are done by enclosing them in brackets: `[* bold]`, etc. So, this kind of "markup" thing on Scrapbox is called "bracketing".

When we use the word "markup," we tend to be conscious of text decoration within a single page, but what is important when considering the organization of knowledge is page-to-page linking, and a notation that allows this to be done without stress was essential. Bracketing fulfills this feature and is very good.

Bracketing
In Scrapbox, bracketing keywords within text using brackets `[ ]` creates links within the project. This is the most important notation.
External links and text formatting are also done by enclosing them in brackets, like `[* bold]`. Thus, in Scrapbox, such 'markup' actions are referred to as 'Bracketing.'

When using the word 'markup,' there's a tendency to focus on text formatting within a single page. However, when considering the organization of knowledge, inter-page linking is crucial. A notation that enables stress-free linking was essential. Bracketing meets this characteristic and is very effective.
