- Idobata-Policy is an AI-collaborative open-source module designed to translate the points of contention raised in large-scale deliberations into "actionable measures.
- This system is paired with the "Idobata Vision" (collection and organization of issues) on the same Idobata platform, and allows for a cyclical collaboration between citizens, experts, and policy makers through a mechanism in which the collected voices are refined through GitHub pull requests.

Background and Positioning
- Digital Democracy 2030 and Idobata
    - Idobata is an OSS developed by the "Digital Democracy 2030" project, which aims to overcome the problem of dissipated deliberations with AI.
- There are two modules: "IdoBata Vision" and "IdoBata Policy". They can be used independently or in combination, depending on the application.
    - Why do we need a "policy" module?
        - Ideas visualized in the deliberation phase are coarse-grained and difficult to implement as they are. The IIDOBATA policy is responsible for (1) documentation, (2) filling in evidence, and (3) coordinating interests, all of which are iterated through the GitHub workflow, to materialize the "who will do what, when, and how".

Examples of Introduction and Demonstration
