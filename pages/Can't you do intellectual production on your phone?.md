title: "Can't you do intellectual production on your phone?"
---

That "[[intellectual production]]" that "you can't do intellectual production on a [[smart phone]]" is ambiguous and includes multiple behaviors.
In my case, the process of writing down "ideas that have not yet solidified in my head" and creating "solidified small parts" is easier to do on a smartphone.
Use a large screen when connecting small parts together to make something larger.
