    - [[flexibility]] and [[adaptability]]: In guerrilla warfare, you will need to be flexible in changing your tactics depending on the situation. Even in situations where there is no clear enemy, it will be important to be flexible enough to constantly adapt to change and try new approaches.
- [[Mobility]] and Speed: Guerrilla warfare requires quick action and decision-making. In unpredictable situations, acting with mobility and speed is essential for survival.
    - Use of [[network]]: In guerrilla warfare, informal networks are used to gather and disseminate information. Even in situations where there is no clear enemy, establishing diverse networks and [[building]] cooperative relationships will be the key to overcoming difficult situations.
- [[a series of small experiments]]: In guerrilla warfare, it is more important to repeat small [[experiments]] quickly than in large-scale operations. In a high [[uncertainty]] environment, a series of small successes can lead to big results.
- [Adaptation to the environment: In guerrilla warfare, you will skillfully use the environment, such as terrain and weather, to your advantage. Even in situations where there is no clear enemy, it will be important to observe the environment surrounding you and make it your ally.　　#Observe the environment and make it your ally
- Importance of [[psychological warfare]]: In guerrilla warfare, psychological influence can be more important than physical combat. Even in situations where there is no clear enemy, you must consider the psychological impact of your actions on those around you and communicate strategically.
    - [[Long-term perspective]] : Guerrilla warfare focuses on achieving long-term goals rather than short-term victories. In an uncertain environment, it will be important to take a long-term perspective rather than being preoccupied with temporary results.

[In the absence of a clear enemy, we may say that we ourselves are fighting against the ever-changing environment itself. To survive in this environment, we should have much to learn from guerrilla tactics. Flexibility, adaptability, mobility, networking, experimentation, [[environmental adaptation]], psychological warfare, and long-term perspective. These are the elements we need to survive in today's society. Even if there is no clear enemy, we may gain a new perspective by thinking of ourselves as fighting a guerrilla war of our own lives.
