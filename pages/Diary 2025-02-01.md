- Comments: o1 with fast response time
- Compared to the o1 Pro, I don't have that "This thing is smarter!" feeling right now. I don't have that feeling at the moment, but the response time is faster than I expected.
- I hope you'll be able to hit it with the API soon, because the quality of work will jump up if you can ask o1 and o3 for advice when Roo Code and Devin get stuck!
    - API is already here!
- The timing of that coming will definitely be within a year.
