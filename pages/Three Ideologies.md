- Pointed out by [Kinta Nakayama
    - [[Ideology in the 21st Century]], the ideology of the 20th century was also tripolar in the first place.
- It is [[false dichotomy]] to think that it was a dichotomy, and [[horseshoe theory]] is a forced expression of it while maintaining a one-dimensional axis of opposition.
- Opinion of Nishio:.
    - Civilization 6 as a model of civilization describes the 20th century as three ideologies to begin with" This is true, I've played it and wasn't really aware of it.
    - I don't recall the Plurality book directly stating that the 20th century was also three ideologies.
    - But it is true that co-author Glen played Civ a lot and used Civ's definition to help explain the 21st century ideology in Plurality, so "Civilization 6 as a modeling of civilization" seems to be implicitly influential.

    - It is obvious if you read the diagram carefully, but if similar diagrams appear one after another, you may be misled into thinking that they are identical.
    - Of the three in the 20th century, "democracy and capitalism" became much stronger, but the two just happened to work together in the 20th century and may be separating in the 21st century
    - If we re-draw these characters, we will have a new tri-polar structure for the 21st century, rather than a 20th century structure.
