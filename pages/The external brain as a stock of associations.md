title: "The external brain as a stock of associations"
---

The expression [[stock of associations]] was created in an attempt to verbalize the positive features of the experience provided by Scrapbox.
    - [[On Scrapbox being a stock of associations]]
- Also related to [[locus of interest]] in [[memex]].

The "closeness" of each concept depends on language and cultural differences
- Spring and spring are close in English-speaking countries, but not at all in Japanese-speaking countries.
- Rather, in Japanese-speaking countries, spring (bane) and bounce (haneru) are close.

Even when using the same language, the distance between individuals varies depending on what they have seen and heard before.
- Distance is subjective
- This allows one person to associate with something because it is "close" and another person does not associate with it because it is "far away".
- So to see other people's associations is to be surprised that "you connect that with that!" becomes a surprise.
- This connection becomes a highway when developing thoughts.
- People who share the same highway can get to the same place faster.
    - But getting off the highway takes time.
    - Conversations with people who have different conceptual systems help with this.
    - [[The new is obtained by the union of different things]].
        - another level meta
            - Someone is joining two persons A and B who are not themselves joined.
                - Similarly, the reverse is also true: I am bound to B and C, but the other party is not.
            - This exchange of "bonds" combines things that were not united alone with each other.
                - A and C are combined

→Shouldn't [[associations be extracted?"]].
