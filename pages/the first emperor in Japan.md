The first Emperor of Japan, according to traditional Japanese history, is Emperor Jimmu([[神武天皇]]). Celebrated on [[National Foundation Day]] every February 11, Emperor Jimmu's accession is said to mark the foundation of Japan. This day is based on legendary accounts rather than solid historical evidence, as the existence and reign of Emperor Jimmu are considered mythical by modern historians.

Emperor Jimmu is a key figure in Japanese mythology and is often associated with the [[Shinto]] religion. According to the "[[Nihon Shoki]]" and the "[[Kojiki]]," two of the oldest records of Japanese history and mythology, Jimmu was a descendant of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]. These texts describe his journey from the region of [[Kyushu]] to the [[Yamato]] province (present-day [[Nara]] Prefecture), where he established his rule and thus founded the nation of Japan. His reign is traditionally dated to 660 BC.

The story of Emperor Jimmu is rich with symbolism and emphasizes themes like bravery, divine right to rule, and the unity of the Japanese people. National Foundation Day serves as a reminder of these ideals and Japan's ancient origins, celebrating the nation's cultural and historical identity.
