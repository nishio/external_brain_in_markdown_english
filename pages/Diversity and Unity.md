- [[It's a mistake to perceive it as a set.]]
- Looking at diversity groups from a unifier's point of view
    - When we recognize that it's a set of humans, it appears to me that the set is fragmented and the "people in it" are getting smaller and smaller.
- Looking at Unificationists from a Diversity Perspective
    - "A set of points in different positions."
    - It appears to me that we should limit its "location" and stop it within a narrow range, ultimately converging on a single point.

- I had a feeling it would be [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]], but I couldn't make it work.

Is it better to have a unified character code that differs from country to country?
Should one browser have most of the market share?
Can we let one social network grab the market share and decide what to filter?
etc
