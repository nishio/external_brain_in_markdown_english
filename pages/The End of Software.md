[The End of Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103cGe8qixC7ZzFsRu5Ww2VEW5YgH9zQaiaqbBsZ1lcc/mobilebasic)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article points out that the software industry is undergoing a major transformation.
The main points are as follows
- Before the Internet, media needed to generate revenue because of the cost of content production.
- With the advent of the Internet, content production costs were reduced to zero and user-generated content surged.
- This put media companies at a structural disadvantage and shifted value to the platform.
- Currently, the high cost of software production necessitates the need to generate revenue.
- Large-scale language models (LLMs) could reduce software production costs to zero.
- This will lead to a similar transformation in the software industry as in the content industry and the rise of new platforms.
- The traditional software business model will collapse and majoring in computer science will be like majoring in journalism in the late 90s.

In short, the author argues that with the advent of LLM, the software industry is about to undergo a major transformation, and the traditional business model will likely no longer work.

Reaction on SNS
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The main reactions on Twitter can be summarized as follows
1. the LLM will not completely replace software developers. Especially for experienced developers, skills are needed to properly use LLMs.
2. software, unlike content, requires continuous maintenance and updating. It is not sufficient to simply generate it with LLM, as it will continue to change to meet the needs of users.
3. companies are looking for consistent support, security, and data management, not just a "hodgepodge of software
4. with the advent of LLM, the value of software development may shift from individual developers to a software aggregation platform.
5. the fundamental difference between content and software is that content is consumed, while software is not. Not everyone can use it.
6. the code generated by the LLM is not perfect and will need to be modified and improved.

In short, while acknowledging the potential for LLM to bring about significant change in the software industry, there were many questions and objections to the article's assertions. It was notable that many of them argued that, due to the nature of software, the same changes may not simply occur as in the content industry.

[Not The End of Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDON4N93IvoXA6CbZ_1RWQ2zCL3aYD2deO3H5AMeYFdL50kXD6bi_LXtzHGcqcMCwjN-w95bDGeAn0/pub)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This rebuttal questions the claims of the original article in the following ways
- It is an oversimplification to say that the advent of the Internet has reduced the cost of content production to zero. Professionally produced content is still costly.
2. many media companies survive by adapting to the digital environment and incorporating user-generated content into their strategies.
3. software development involves many areas besides coding that require human expertise, such as quality control, UX design, compliance, and security.
4. the claim that LLM reduces software development costs to zero is speculative; the infrastructure for LLM itself is also expensive.
5. it is not appropriate to simply compare software and media business models. Software has complex aspects such as licensing, support, and integrated services.
6. computer science includes other important areas besides coding, such as algorithms, data science, AI, and cybersecurity, which will continue to be important in the future.

In other words, while acknowledging the potential for LLM to have a significant impact on software development, they point out that a more nuanced discussion is needed to understand the complexities of both industries. He suggests that technological advances will not completely replace the software industry, but rather evolve it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Assume that the historical changes that have occurred in the media industry will also occur in the software industry. For example, the emergence of "user-generated content" will correspond to the emergence of "user-generated code.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Let us predict the future of the software industry with reference to the historical changes in the media industry.
1. the rise of "user-generated code
    - Just as "user-generated content" has emerged in the media industry, technologies such as LLM will allow many ordinary users to participate in software development. They do not need to be professional software engineers to create applications that meet their needs.
2. decline of traditional software companies
    - As user-generated code increases, traditional software companies will lose their competitive edge. Companies that have high development costs and cannot respond flexibly to user needs will be eliminated.
3. the rise of software platforms
    - Platforms like YouTube and Instagram will take on the role of aggregating and distributing user-generated code. Connecting individual developers and users to form a software ecosystem.
4. increase in niche software
    - Just as the lowering of the bar for content creation has led to more media specializing in niche interests, the lowering of the bar for software development will lead to more diverse and specialized applications.
5. changing role of software developers
    - Just as the role of journalists has changed in the media industry, so will the role of software developers. Instead of just coding, they will specialize in more advanced design, architecture, and coordination with AI systems.

However, there are also fundamental differences between media and software. Software requires continuous maintenance and updates and also plays an important role in supporting industrial and social infrastructure. For this reason, it cannot be left completely to "amateurs," and I believe that while utilizing LLM, collaboration with professional software engineers will increase. Overall, a more open and diverse software development ecosystem is expected to emerge.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Due to the fundamental difference between media and software, first once a social problem arises, then preventive measures develop. Talking about it.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right. Given the differences between media and software, transforming the software industry may be challenging.
1. increased security and privacy issues
    - The increase in user-generated code could lead to a number of security and privacy issues. Unlike user-generated content in media, software directly accesses systems and data, which can lead to the proliferation of software containing malicious code and vulnerabilities.
2. social and economic disruption
    - Social and economic disruption may occur if critical infrastructure and business-related software is deployed without adequate verification and maintenance. Excessive reliance on user-generated code risks compromising system reliability and stability.
3. strengthening of laws and regulations
    - The frequency of these problems may lead to stricter laws and regulations regarding software development and distribution. Regulations that affect the entire software industry may be introduced, such as restricting user-generated code and requiring strict quality control.
4. increased responsibility for software platforms
    - Platforms that aggregate and distribute user-generated code will be subject to greater responsibilities. The burden on platform operators will increase, including checking for harmful software and verifying the identity of developers.
5. reaffirming the importance of collaboration with experts
    - After experiencing social problems, the importance of professionals in software development will be reaffirmed: while utilizing LLM, it will be understood that collaboration with professional software engineers is essential in terms of security, quality control, and maintenance.
6. development of new development methods and tools
    - To address these issues, new development practices and tools may evolve to make more secure use of user-generated code. We can expect to see software development best practices evolve, such as automated code verification, security checks, and version control systems.

While the changes in the media industry cannot simply be applied to the software industry, there is every possibility that similar changes will occur. The key is to recognize the differences between media and software and to take precautions while maximizing the benefits of new technologies. The software industry will need to build a more secure and sustainable development ecosystem through trial and error.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Government and municipal software procurement is also expected to be significantly affected.
1. changes in procurement methods
    - We may move away from traditional large-scale software development projects to smaller, more flexible approaches. They will be required to utilize user-generated code and open source software to quickly implement needed functionality.
2. review of budget allocation
    - The overall decrease in software development costs will require a rethinking of budget allocations. While software licensing and custom development costs will decrease, budgets for security measures and maintenance will become more important.
3. changes in procurement standards
    - Procurement criteria should focus on software quality, security, and maintainability. When utilizing user-generated code, the reliability and track record of the developer must also be considered.
4. the importance of staff with technical expertise
    - Staff with technical expertise is essential to properly evaluate and utilize LLM and user-generated code; education and training on AI and software development should be strengthened to improve the skills of staff.
5. software development with citizen participation
    - The use of user-generated code may provide more opportunities for citizens to directly participate in software development. Incorporating citizen input into the development of applications for administrative services may also result in more user-friendly and effective software.
6. code sharing with other municipalities
    - The use of user-generated code may facilitate software sharing among municipalities. Municipalities that need similar functionality can share and improve codes with each other to efficiently develop and deploy software.
7. security and privacy considerations
    - Government and municipal software often deals with sensitive and personal information and requires special attention to security and privacy protection. When utilizing user-generated code, strict security standards must be established and regular audits must be conducted.

In government and municipalities, it is expected that software development will become more democratized and efficient. It is important to explore the possibilities of LLM and user-generated code, and to address the risks appropriately.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Software procurement in the private sector is also expected to undergo a major transformation.
1. further spread of SaaS
    - Software as a Service (SaaS) will become more prevalent due to reduced software development costs and the use of user-generated code. The mainstream will be to use only the necessary functions on the cloud.
2. elimination of vendor lock-in
    - Increased use of user-generated code and open source software will make it possible to procure software independent of specific vendors. Companies will be able to flexibly select and combine software that meets their needs.
3. changes in in-house development
    - The use of LLM may also change the nature of software development within a company. Not only professional software engineers, but also general employees may be able to participate in software development to some extent, and a more agile development system may be established.
4. importance of technical evaluation
    - When implementing user-generated code or open source software, its quality and reliability must be properly assessed. Technology due diligence will become increasingly important, including setting up a dedicated team within the company for technology evaluation or working with outside experts.
5. enhanced security measures
    - Security risks may increase with the use of user-generated code. Companies will need to strengthen software security audits and respond quickly to vulnerabilities. Security training for employees will also be important.
6. use of external resources
    - In addition to in-house software development, external user-generated code and freelance developers will be increasingly utilized. Software development will become more efficient by quickly implementing necessary functions with external resources.
7. management of intellectual property rights
    - When utilizing user-generated code or open source software, care must also be taken to manage intellectual property rights. Legal support for proper handling of licenses and protection of your company's intellectual property will be important.

Private companies are required to be agile in the transformation of software procurement and proactively utilize new technologies. At the same time, they must not neglect risk management related to quality, security, and intellectual property rights. It is essential to review the way software procurement is done and find the best strategy for your company. Building a flexible and robust software procurement system while enhancing in-house technical capabilities and effectively utilizing external resources will determine the competitiveness of your company.
