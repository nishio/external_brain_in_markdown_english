title: "vegetative growth"
---

- Mental images focusing on [[growth]] among [[Parable of the Plants]] and [[Botanical Metaphors]].
- Outcomes are not created by human action alone, but by the passage of time.
    - You don't grow twice as fast by working twice as hard.
    - Waiting is necessary
- Productivity does not improve linearly with resource consolidation
    - Double the fertilizer doesn't yield double the harvest.
    - It is foolish to try to get twice the fruit from one fruit tree
    - That labor could be better spent on growing new fruit trees.
- It takes several years from the time fruit trees are planted until they are ready to bear fruit.
