What you need to do to move things into a state of "[[grasping]]"

Metaphor of tidying up
- There's a box that I don't know what's in it.
- The [[big picture]] will never be grasped until this box [[is]] "not sure what's in it.

In source code reading
- File and function names have a [[Name]] that gives a dim idea of "what's inside".

    - [[Masui Method of Organizing Clear Files]] assigns sequential numbers to spaces (=clear files).
        - [[liquidation]]
    - What's in there" is digital data.
            - [[making searchable]]
