> [kazunori_279](https://x.com/kazunori_279/status/1862588175866372388) From statistics to machine learning to LLM, everything is induction, not deduction, so no matter how far you go, you will never get the "right" answer.

>  Induction and deduction are different ways of thinking.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1864624579114881415) "If [[deduction]], if the premise is correct, then the conclusion is 100% correct.", skip over "[[assumption]]" to see if it is correct. Too many people don't think about it.
