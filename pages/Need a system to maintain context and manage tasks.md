Need a system to maintain context and manage tasks

As for AI programming, I think we are already in a situation where it is clearly improving productivity.
However, there is an important condition: AI cannot complete things, right? Because it is humans who determine that they are completed.
So, what this means is that the amount of tasks that would be done if AI increased productivity would increase, and the amount of tasks waiting for human review would pile up.

Certainly, as AI productivity increases tasks, the waiting list for human review can pile up. We will need to find a way to strike a balance between the two.

He said that AI task management is needed as a means to solve this problem.
Not only waiting for reviews, but tasks that need to be performed in a disconnected and disjointed context require a system that maintains context and manages tasks in order to reduce stress.

That's right. If we had a system that could manage tasks without fragmentation and maintain context, it would reduce stress and make tasks run more smoothly.
