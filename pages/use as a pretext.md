- The expression "dashi ni suru" is a Japanese idiom meaning to make use of something or to use it as an excuse or means. Originally, "[[front man]]" referred to the [[dashi]] ([[soup stock]]) used to bring out the flavor in cooking, but it has been turned from there to mean to make good use of something in order to achieve some other goal.
- For example, when you "use" something as a pretext to advance a conversation, it means that you are using the topic as a pretext to achieve another intention. In English, this expression is similar to "use as a pretext" or "leverage".

    - [Put [[dried shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes)]] or katsuobushi, a thinly shaved piece, in hot water and [[gut]].
- Dried shiitake mushrooms are a metaphor related to [[dead text]], [[dead tree]], or
    - Often [[dried daikon crabs]] themselves are not eaten, but thrown away.
    - Only [[umami (fifth category of taste, corresponding to the flavor of glutamates)]]" is sucked out and discarded.
        - [[Leverage memo]] Target.
- Delicious with broth of multiple origins.
- On the other hand, an ingredient used as a broth can absorb the flavor from another ingredient and become delicious.
