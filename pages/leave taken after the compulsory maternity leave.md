title: "leave taken after the compulsory maternity leave"
---

A leave to nurture yourself. One of [[Cybozu's Human Resources System]]. Started in 2012.

> The purpose of this program is to provide those who are leaving Cybozu with a sense of security that they can return to the team and take on challenges. Those who wish to use this system can return to Cybozu for up to six years.

Same as the parental leave (2006-) which is 6 years.
President Aono himself took parental leave in 2010.
The idea was born that parental leave would not only nurture the child, but also help him or her grow.
If that is the case, then the flow of thought is that the experience outside the company is the same because it also leads to his/her growth.
