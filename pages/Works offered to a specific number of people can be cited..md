title: "Works offered to a specific number of people can be cited."

    - What is [[reference]]?
    - Copyright Act 32
    - >  (citation needed)
    - > Works which have been made public may be quoted and used. In such cases, the quotation shall be in conformity with fair practice and within the limits justified for the purpose of news reporting, criticism, research or other quotation.
    - What is [[official announcement]]?
    - Copyright Act, Article 18.
    - > Subsection 2 Moral Rights of Authors
    - > （ [[right of publicity]] ）
    - > Article 18 The author shall have the right to offer or present his work, which has not yet been published (...) (1) The author shall have the right to offer or present to the public his work which has not yet been made public (...). The same shall apply to derivative works based on such works.
    - What is [[the public]]?
    - Copyright Act, Article 2, Section 5.
    - > 5 "[[the public]]" as used in this Act shall include specific and numerous persons.

So, for example, lecture materials presented at an event that only a specific number of members can attend, or the content of a paid newsletter that only a specific number of subscribed members can read, can be cited.

The citation must be consistent with fair practice and within the limits justified for the purpose of reporting, criticism, research, or other citation. Who bears the burden of proof as to whether this "conforms to fair practice"?
- Whether the copyright holder has a right to demand omission when the author asks the quoter not to quote him, because that is demanding omission from someone else.
    - Rights do not arise without a basis, so there is a need on the part of the author to show a basis.
