[Thinking about a new form of outliner - Yubitec](https://ubiteku.oinker.me/2018/07/02/new-outliner/)

> The concept of "Kotonoma
> As the network grows, there will emerge kotos that have more connections than others. Such kotos are likely to represent concepts that are important to the participants. Upgrade that koto to a "kotonoma".

> This feature may be a development of the feature [[Outliner "Focus"]]. This function may be said to be a development of the function [[Outliner "Focus"]].
- > >I feel that the nature of an outliner as a "collection of sentences" is not always recognized by those who develop outliners. Outliners that are aware of this have a "focus" feature to support this (also called "zoom," "hoist," "wind-up," etc., depending on the outliner). In a nutshell, it is a feature that temporarily displays any item in the outline as the top level of the hierarchy. Since other items are hidden from view, you can concentrate on that item. - Introduction to Outline Processing
