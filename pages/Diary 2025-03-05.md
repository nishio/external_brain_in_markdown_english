- [[Maybe we should stop working when we feel busy.]]

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897276786997969028) [[HUNTER x HUNTER]], I read it to the point where I did a [[full dive]]. Maybe it won't come out again, but the melody and memory guy was a good guy.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897279995653054644) I'm starting to see more and more that recovering a damaged psyche by operating in a multi-channel multi-threaded way as an AI agent and an integrated system is It is the time of single-channel single-threading, like immersion in reading (I read HUNTER x HUNTER).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897280740527890863) While [[purposeful reading]] such as finding information will be replaced by AI search and generation, reading for the purpose of [[immersion in the story]] itself, not for the purpose of obtaining information may become more valuable as a time to heal the spirit that has been cut off by the drive for efficiency.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897282478492274734) In retrospect, it's just another experiment I've been doing for years, "[[trying]] to apply a high-intensity load while metacognizing my intellectual production process". I know, right?
- Work intensity is too high if we work in accordance with AI.
- Try [[high-intensity load]] while [[metacognition]] your [intellectual production process
    - This will be an episode when [[Intellectual production techniques for engineers who use LLM]] is written.



> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897293353647267873) I think that those who have been following the weekly serials may have their interest heightened by the "what happens next" feeling. Unlike manga and novels, which you can't stop reading once you start and it's 5:00 in the morning, you're not really immersed in the story if you have to stop once you've started a new story.
