- [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] > I have been thinking about "purpose. Purpose is "something that [[one's self at a certain point in time]] has decided with the knowledge and information one has," but to have no purpose is "to be decided by an entity other than oneself or to have [[one's decision waver]]," so the former and latter are both good things, right?

nishio> You mean that by not having a goal, you can do [[a broad search]]?

Tomoya Tachikawa> I think it could go either way, whether it's a broad search or not, but it could be the discovery of "different areas of search" in the first place, or "by not deciding on an objective, you feel more comfortable accepting chance results than someone who has already decided on an objective".


[[Discover "different search areas"]]
- [[different search areas]].
    - [[Search area]]
        - [[search space]]

[[Accepting coincidental results]]
    - [[(by) chance]]
- [[accept result]]
