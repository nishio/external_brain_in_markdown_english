> [@UsanekoBlack](https://twitter.com/UsanekoBlack/status/1652292114775158786?s=20): There was a guy on a matching app that I really liked, but (unfortunately) he had a high income and seemed popular. So I sent him a message identifying the equation in the picture he posted. I sent him a message about it, my matching app is wrong!
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1652532894915756032?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): people who put partial differential equations on matching apps, they perceive partial differential equations as "cool I don't think it's someone who uses it as a tool on a daily basis, because they recognize it as "something to make it look cool", i.e. [[the extraordinary]]. Just like [[people who get kanji tattoos often cannot read kanji]].
