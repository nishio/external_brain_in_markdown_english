---

    - If [[percentage of correct answers]] is high, ask for a new [[impetus]].
    - Tell a human that you want new data.
    - Trying to get out of the [comfort zone
    - In the case of [[supervised learning]], [[correct]] is known, so it can be measured by the percentage of correct answers
- What if [[unsupervised learning]] does not know the correct answer?
    - Would you change the initial value and reconsider?
