[[0→1]]
- [[Drill a hole in the levee]]
If you make a small hole when there is a large gap in the water surface, the water will start to flow and grow on its own.
- This is [[1 to 100]].
- So if we go from 0 to 1, which has the potential for proper exponential development, we don't need to make any effort in the process of 1 to 100?
- Rather, it will be 100 on its own, but it will not necessarily be 100 in this favorable direction, so constant effort is required to keep correcting the direction and to become 100 in the favorable direction.

- [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]
