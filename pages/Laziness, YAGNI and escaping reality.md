title: "Laziness, YAGNI and escaping reality"

> Programmers say that [[tending to find things bothersome]] is better, but at my level, if something like this were to happen in the future, I would probably [[bother(some) to do]] and develop libraries to solve imaginary troublesome problems that don't exist at all. But they don't do anything about the troublesome reality in front of them until right before it happens. This is called [[escapism]].

Laziness, though, is acting to lower "future costs."
It's an attitude that goes against [[YAGNI]] to act to lower imaginary "future costs".
