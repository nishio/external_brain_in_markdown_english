title: "Graveyard of dead documents"
---

If a document that is not going to be updated in the future is a [[dead document]], then a document that is not going to be updated in the future should be placed in a [[graveyard]].
If by "[[completion]]" you mean a state of affairs that will not need to be updated in the future, then the blog where the completed text is placed is a graveyard of dead documents.
