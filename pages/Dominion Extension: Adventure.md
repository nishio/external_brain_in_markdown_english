- [[Expansion after the adventure has high card power.]] So I checked.
[https://wikiwiki.jp/dominiondeck/冒険](https://wikiwiki.jp/dominiondeck/冒険)

:

```
{{c6::adventure}}:wine merchant {{c5::5}}
Action-Reserve {{c1::+1 buy}}+{{c2::4●}}, place this card on the tavern mat
At {{c3::End of Purchase Phase}}, if you have {{c4::2 Coins}} left over, you can discard this card on the Bar Mat at once.
```

I built a deck for [[Anki]].
- I'd be happy to share, but I'm making it messy for myself, so I don't know, maybe you'd be better off making it yourself.
