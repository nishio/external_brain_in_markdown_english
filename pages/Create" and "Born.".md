"[[make up (one's face, etc.)]]" and "[[born]]"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The idea that the world was "intentionally created" and the idea that the world "came into being naturally" are expressed in different forms in various mythologies and religions. The following is a brief explanation with representative examples.
--

# 1. "Create" type
.

## [[Christianity]]
- Beginning of the Old Testament "[[Genesis]]".
- >  "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
- The story is that God (Yahweh) created heaven and earth and all living things in seven days with a clear intention. This is a classic example of an entity like an "architect" supposedly creating the world.

## [[Japanese mythology]]
- Kojiki" and "Nihon shoki": Izanagi and Izanami's creation of the nation
- >  The "Amanuma no Nuboko," a spear given from heaven, was lowered into the sea, and when it was pulled up, the island solidified from the drops.
- In this way, the process of "shaping the land" by the gods using tools is described, and the act of deliberately "creating" the world is emphasized.

# 2. "born (generated)" type
.

## [[Greek mythology]]
- [[Hesiod]] "[[Theosophical]]"
- >  "First there was chaos."
- The world is said to arise spontaneously from [[chaotic]] ([[chaos]]), from which the earth (Gaia), love (Eros), darkness (Erebos), etc. are successively differentiated. The spontaneous development stands out more than the existence of an orderly creator.

## [[Indian mythology]]
- The story of the [[cosmic egg]] ([[Brahmananda]]) and the "[[Naasdhya Sukta]] ([[Hymn to the Origin of the Universe]])" in the [[Rig Veda]].
- >  "At the time [[there was]] neither existence nor non-existence."
- It is an image of a world that was gradually formed by the action of nature from a primordial state in which nothing was fixed. The power of "generation" is at the root of this image, and it does not necessarily mean that a specific personal deity "intentionally created" the world.

# Summary
.

- The **make" philosophy** emphasizes the creation of the world by the "definite will" of God or a transcendent being. The creation of the Old Testament and the myth of the birth of the nation in Japanese mythology are prime examples of this, in which order, design, and purpose are clear.
- [The idea of "birth" describes the "spontaneous unfolding" of the world from its primordial chaos or egg-like state. The Greek theory of the origin of chaos and the Indian cosmic egg emphasize [[abiogenesis (biology)]] of birth and suggest that a "[[primordial force]]" or "[[flow]]" rather than divine intention brought the world into being. "[[fundamental force]]" or "[[flow]]" is said to have given birth to the world.

In many cases, there is not a pure division between the two, but rather a mixture of the two, such as "chaos at first, spontaneously generated, and then God intervened and set it in place. However, if we look at it from the perspective of "creation/birth," it is easy to understand and organize the differences in the worldviews of each mythology and religion.

- Japanese mythology is a two-tiered system: the creation of the world is a "birth" system, and the creation of the country is a "creation" system.
