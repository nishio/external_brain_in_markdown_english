    - [[üåÄ"Hacker's Testament" AI-ized]]

    - Put 190 PDFs I had on hand into Scrapbox (PC is DOING it).
        - It became Too Many Requests.
    - Implement resumption of interrupted processing
        - But we can only continue when Quota recovers.
        - I've put on a recovery mode that identifies and recovers anything that's in a halfway state, and I'll run it at night.
- Correspondence between lecture material and questions
    - üçÖI'll just do that because I'll lose track of what I'm answering verbally in the lecture when the video is gone.

Do low-impact walking.

Compare with yesterday's task tree and change or cut out anything that has not changed
üåÄ what you don't need to work on tomorrow.
