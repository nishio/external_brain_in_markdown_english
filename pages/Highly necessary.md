title: "Highly necessary"
---

If I wrote, "X is necessary for Y," it would mean, "If there is no X, then there is no Y." ([[requirement]])
If it is not a requirement, how do you write it?

- "X is a factor that [[contributes]] to the establishment of Y."
- X is an important element for Y."
- "X is [[a cause]] of Y."
None of this feels right.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- How about, "X's [[contribution]] is high."
    - Considering that you initially wrote "[[need]] high," maybe the nuance you're trying to express is packed in "[[degree]] high."
