- > "Doing what you love" is important here! It's unfortunate that you spend your time doing something you don't like! Don't make a proposal that says "do something you don't like as if you did like it" no matter what those around you say. It is an act of throwing garbage at [[Future self]].

Suppose you have acquired limited resources by lying as if you have enthusiasm for something you do not have [[enthusiasm]] for.
First, the action causes one person who would otherwise have gained resources to lose resources.
Second, resources are squandered by those who set aside resources to support those who are enthusiastic.
Finally, you, who lied and got resources, are forced into a situation where you have to be enthusiastic about something you are not enthusiastic about, and you are tormented by your lies.
