### digest of notes
.
Warning that quantitative indicators can be manipulated.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragments "Three 'ease of doing' are important (p. 192)," "Non-quantifiable goals are meaningless," and "Predictably irrational" have a common theme regarding the problems with quantitative indicators and how to deal with them. They indicate the potential for quantitative indicators to be manipulated and suggest three elements of "ease of doing," not turning a blind eye to goals that are difficult to quantify, and anticipating irrational results as a way to deal with them.

### deep thinking
While quantitative indicators have the disadvantage of their manipulability, they are also effective tools for clarifying progress in achieving goals. However, their use should be used with caution and their importance should not be overlooked, especially for goals that are difficult to quantify.
