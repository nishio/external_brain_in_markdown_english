title: "McClelland's theory of desire"
---

    - [[motivation theory]] proposed by [[McClelland]].
    - The theory that there are three types of desire: [[desire to achieve]], [[lust for power]], and [[desire for affinity]].
    - Later [[desire to avoid]] was added to become [4 Desires
- Nishio feels that this method of thinking in terms of "desire to achieve," "desire for power," "desire for affinity," and "desire to avoid" is very useful.
        - [[Maslow's stage theory of needs]] also classified human needs into several categories.
        - I figured that was the hierarchy.
        - This implicitly assumes that all humans have the same hierarchy of needs.
        - Also, when we see people with different expressed desires, we end up with an interpretation that puts a higher/lower level of achievement on people, saying that some people have a higher/lower level of desire achievement.
    - On the flip side, McClelland's is not hierarchical in its four desires.
        - The natural expression of [[diversity]] in the desires of different people.


- desire to achieve
        - [[want to accomplish]]
        - I want to do it in an [[efficiency]] way.
    - Later McClelland creates [competency theory
- lust for power
    - I want to exercise [[influence]] on others
        - [[control]] I want to
- desire for affinity
    - I want to create [[one's relationships]] with others
    - From others [[I want to be liked.]].
- desire to avoid
        - [[I don't want to fail.]]
        - I want to avoid [[stress]].

- [[David McClelland.]]
