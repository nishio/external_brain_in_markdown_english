It's not interesting to hear about those who choose not to see it.

It's not interesting to talk about why someone chooses not to look at something and not to look at it.
- Interesting to hear about what else you are seeing.

It's been repeated over and over again.
- I don't watch TV, I don't look at my phone, I don't watch Discord."
- Maybe after tomorrow, people will say "Bluesky is - so I won't watch it.
- Nothing they say is funny.

When the telescope was invented
There were those who refused to take a peek.

- [[one must see with one's own eyes]]

- [[People who don't look at the moon through a telescope.]]
