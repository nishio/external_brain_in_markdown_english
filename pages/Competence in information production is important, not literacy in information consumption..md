> [[Audrey Tang]]: Yeah, definitely. Now this was the question we tackled when we worked on the basic education curriculum. And that was before I joined the cabinet. And the answer to that is that we need to change how scoring system work in schools and examinations and so on. Instead of testing literacy, which is about how you consume information, we need to test competence, which is how you produce information that is serving the common good.
Tang said Taiwan is working on reforming its educational curriculum, which should emphasize competence in producing information for the [[public good]] rather than literacy in consuming information.

> Audrey Tang: And I think really lifelong learning is what shields people against this kind of polarizing ideologies. And only by working with the education system can we really change the nature of the conversation online and also face to face.
Tang believes that [[lifelong learning]] can protect people from [[polarized (light, radio waves)]] ideas and change the nature of interaction, both online and in person, by working with educational systems. This leads to the idea that technologies such as [[Polis 2.0]] will play an important role in strengthening democracy.

- [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]]
- [[intellectual production]]
