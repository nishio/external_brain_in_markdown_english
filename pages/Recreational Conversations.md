Recreational Conversations
T:
- It's exciting to be able to communicate verbally and pompously, isn't it?
- I think [[the heat in the middle of an exchange]] is important.
    - [[Real-time editing]]
N:
- It's a lot more intense, but it might be [[saying the right things in a flirtatious way]], and that's how LLM and I behave.
T:
- I see, I guess that would be fine with LLM then.
N:
- I recently created a voice English conversation bot on GPTs and we talk in the bath at night until we run out of quota. I can call it 24 hours a day whenever I want, and whether I'm taking a bath or interrupting to wash my head, I can communicate by voice without being rude, and everything is transcribed!
- Much better than a random instructor at an English conversation school.
- The conversation with Mr. Tachikawa is already above the GPTs because of the shared context and vocabulary we've accumulated so far, but the value of chatting with the general public that isn't is being eroded by the GPTs.
T:
- The context and vocabulary you've accumulated so far will eventually be replaced if only you can reflect it.
- What is the meaning of communication with humans w
N:
- If we can reflect knowledge sharing, we'll be able to do "reflect all the discussions in the conference" before the chit-chat, and the "character who knows all the discussions in the conference" will be born, and the progress of science will be amazing.
- You'll be communicating with humans for entertainment, not for utility.
- Just like watching videos for knowledge acquisition at double speed and videos for entertainment at constant speed.
- Do all work-related communication with AI and talk with humans in circles and at home.
- As a type of recreation
T:
- People who don't have circles or families can't communicate for entertainment, and I don't think that's a future I'd like to see. w
    - I wonder if it still is...?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Is it the perception that there is entertainment in the work conversation?
- It would take away the entertainment factor from those who say, "The only communication I have with people is at work."
- I think this area has something to do with my motivation for starting my own podcast.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Full remote + childcare has reduced chit-chat a lot in the last few years.
    - I was inclined to substitute something just on the sending side of communication.
        - I have the sense that I was building something of myself through chatting with people.
            - Yes?
                - Ego?
                - He was advancing his thoughts by talking.
                - I was picking up my own feelings by listening to myself talk.
                    - Here it is.
                    - [[Thinking with his mouth]] type
                        - [[I realize that the start of telecommuting and childcare had reduced the opportunities for chit-chat and thereby halted the cycle of contemplation]].
                        - I guess I was writing this a month ago...
                        - [[think in writing]] の亜種で[[話して考える]]があるのか<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I had a feeling that even before the development of AI, there were quite a few people who were placed in environments where there was little communication in that way.
        - Is that the demand for cabarets that is being talked about next, or something like that?
            - Others don't communicate specifically to make you feel good about yourself...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
N:
- Poor little thing.
- But an AI that has learned to "play human and provide recreation through conversation" will be available to pay the bills.
- [[Cabaret AI]]
T:
- Oh! Dystopia!
N:
- When I get home, my wife, Hatsune Miku, is there and we can have a recreational conversation.
- It's a subscription, so if you can't pay, your wife disappears, and you're out of money. ......
- Switch to pay-as-you-go mode to reduce costs and only have one conversation per year: ......
    - Orihime and Hikoboshi.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>
