title: "book"

In response to the problem of too large a release for a product called a book, we have experimented with various smaller releases, such as creating a presentation material that can be read as a reading material.
When I saw the new Mach book, I thought, I haven't experimented with releasing it for a fee.
When I think about why, for me, writing is not a "means to get paid" in the first place, so I'm not interested in whether my clients will pay or not.
Signaling Effects

On the other hand, how about doing a new Mach book in an English-speaking country?
