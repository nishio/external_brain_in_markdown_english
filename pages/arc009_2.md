- A world where the numbers are interchangeable, and the problem is to sort the given numbers according to the scale in the other world.
- The size of the problem is not so large that you can just replace the string and sort.
- [[maketrans]]
python

```
def solve(BS, N, SS):
    import string
    trans = str.maketrans("".join(BS), string.digits)
    SS.sort(key=lambda s: int(s.translate(trans)))
    return SS


def main():
    # parse input
    BS = list(input().decode('ascii').split())
    N = int(input())
    SS = [input().strip().decode('ascii') for i in range(N)]
    print(*solve(BS, N, SS), sep="\n")
```
