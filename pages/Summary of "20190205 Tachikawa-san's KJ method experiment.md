- [Have Claude 3 Opus summarize [[20190205KJ method experiment by Mr. Tachikawa]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/> For those interested in the [[KJ method]], here is a summary of the key points of this session.

KJ Method Flow:.
- Write down on sticky notes as many as you can think of about the subject (in this case, we asked the participants to write down 100 sticky notes in advance).
- Spread out sticky notes so they can be listed.
- Collect and group potentially related stickies
- Label (nameplate) each group
- Consider and illustrate relationships between groups
- Deepening the discussion.

Points: 1.
- It is important to freely write down on sticky notes anything that comes to mind. Do not hesitate to write things that may be ethically problematic.
- Grouping should be done bottom-up, focusing on the relationship between the two stickies. Avoid setting top-down classification criteria.
- Each group label is represented on a single sticky note. The labels will be more abstract.
- Some stickies (hagre monkeys) do not join the group at first, but they can lead to unexpected realizations later.
- The process of diagramming reveals new relationships between groups. It is important to be flexible and not be bound by stereotypes.
- When associations are accompanied by physical sensations, such as leaps and gestures, it is a sign of important discoveries.
- The concepts that emerge are clarified by putting them into words and writing them on sticky notes.
- If time permits, repeating the steps of grouping, labeling, and diagramming will provide further insight.

Finally, as Mr. Tachikawa himself realized, "[[Likes]] are close to me," the real appeal of the KJ method is that it allows us to see the essence of things that we were not aware of before. In order to gain deeper insight, I felt that it is important to be flexible like Mr. Tachikawa, questioning conventional frameworks and deepening one's thinking.
