title: "People in the first community stick together."

People in the [[first community]] [[stick]] to that [Community
- We want that community to remain in good standing.
- I would put more than the appropriate level of effort for that community.

Not so for those who have moved between multiple communities.
- If a community can't be managed with a reasonable level of effort, don't get involved and move to another community.
- If you're related to someone, you'll meet them here and there.
    - If you find a good community, you can talk to people you think would be good for you and bring them here.
- We'd rather see more and more communities arise and more and more crumble.
    - Related: [[The social network that keeps escaping]].

[[Depends if there is only one]]
    - [[Independence means more dependents.]]
