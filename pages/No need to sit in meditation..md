It's important to "reduce the amount of stimulus coming in."
- Sitting is an option as a method to achieve this.
- Choice of relaxing in the bath or walking.

- Maybe [[zazen (seated Zen meditation, usu. in a cross-legged position)]] is the image of what you're supposed to sit in.
    - Some sects emphasize sitting.
- But there are walking sects.
        - [[Zen meditation]]
    - > In Rinzai, as it is also called "running [[meditation performed while walking]]," one walks at a brisk pace, sometimes as fast as one can run.
    - > In contrast, in the Soto sect, one breath is half a step, and in one breath you walk half the width of your foot.

- For example, even if you take a bath and just sit in a state of blankness, your mind is still calm, which is a kind of meditation.
    - Some people think of meditation as some kind of special ritual.
    - That's because some people want to stage it like a special ceremony.
    - Related: [[Intellectual production is not stoicism.]]
- Even if Buddha was enlightened by zazen, it is not right to think that sitting is essential because of it.
- It is [[penance]] to put someone who is not used to sitting on a hard floor into a state where they feel "[[suffering]]" if their buttocks hurt and their feet hurt.
        - [[Buddha didn't tell us to suffer.]] Rather, Buddha said no suffering.
    - We do not become enlightened by doing painful things.
- To begin with, compared to Buddha's time, people today spend the majority of their time sitting.
    - Level of sitting too much is bad for your health.
    - Sitting further from that state does not have much of a "switch from normal life" effect.
    - Rather, vigorous exercise followed by rest is closer to the original "zazen."
    - There's one called [[Kundalini Meditation]] where you exercise for 30 minutes and then relax for 30 minutes.
- I don't think you can meditate while watching Twitter, indeed.
    - In other words, "reducing the amount of stimulus coming in" is important.
    - Bathrooms are also suitable for meditation because there's little stimulation if there's nothing in the bathroom, and you can't meditate if you play Netflix.
