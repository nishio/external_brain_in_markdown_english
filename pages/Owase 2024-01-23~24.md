> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1749585937221484728/photo/1) I'm on my way to Owase.
> I am going to visit [[Local Coop]], which is working on a system of outsourcing services originally provided by local governments to the private sector using [[PFI]] ([[designated administrator system]]), [[SIB]] ([[social impact bond]]), etc.
>  As mentioned in "[[Next Generation Government]]", especially for software, I think the core needs to be centralized, but for applications, I think a more [[Civictech]] approach + support structure for them is a good idea. I think it would be good to have a support structure for them. ("[[Public administration as a platform]]")
>  The idea itself is not new, but I haven't seen many examples of it working well.
>  I would like to consider why it doesn't work, and if it might work in local coop, and why.

- [[blue carbon]]
- > The carbon that is taken up by coastal and marine ecosystems and stored in their biomass and underlying soils is called Blue Carbon, which was defined in the "Blue Carbon" report published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2009 and has attracted worldwide attention as a new option for sink measures. Blue Carbon" is now attracting worldwide attention as a new option for carbon sinks. The major sinks for Blue Carbon are seaweed beds, salt marshes such as tidal flats, and mangrove forests, which are called "Blue Carbon ecosystems.

Approaches to Connecting to Markets
    - [[carbon credit]]
    - > Carbon offsetting is the concept of compensating for greenhouse gas emissions by investing in activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. In order to ensure that the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals used for carbon offsetting is reliable, the Japan Verified Emission Reduction ("J-VER") System was established in November 2008 to certify emission reductions and removals resulting from domestic emission reduction activities and forest improvement. The J-VER (Japan Verified Emission Reduction) Scheme was established in November 2008 to certify the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals resulting from domestic emission reduction activities and forestation, and in fiscal 2013, the J-Credit Scheme was launched as an evolutionary integration of the J-VER Scheme and the Domestic Credit Scheme.
    - [About J-Credit System and Carbon Offsetting | Global Environment and International Environmental Cooperation | Ministry of the Environment](https://www.env.go.jp/earth/ondanka/mechanism/carbon_offset.html)
- > The J-Credit System is a system under which the government certifies the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions and absorption as credits.

- It takes about two years before the money is actually earned.

    - By combining an organizational system that operates on an annual budget with a private organizational system that does not operate on an annual budget, the inefficiencies caused by the budget system can be absorbed.

Approaches to reduce costs
- Cost savings will be the source of funds.
    - Municipalities stop collecting garbage and outsource it to the private sector.
    - Streamline and reduce costs in the private sector
- Q: In the short term, will the cost to citizens increase and will hate increase?
    - There is a need to regain self-governance in local governments that have been swallowed up by "big municipalities" due to external factors such as municipal mergers and have lost their "self-governance" (= sense of being in control).
    - Many people prefer it if they can regain their "autonomy" by paying a small time cost.
        - interesting<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - So [[social participation]] was lost for the sake of efficiency?
            - The customer value lies in the fact that some of the money floated by rationalization can be used to fund local public investment, and "autonomy" can be restored by opening up participation in decision-making to residents.

        - > A blue-gray or greenish-gray soil layer derived from divalent iron, which is produced in a reducing environment saturated with moisture. It is derived from the Russian dialect word gley (muddy soil), which refers to blue-gray soils in areas of poor drainage near peatlands. In waterlogged soils or poorly drained soils with high groundwater levels, microorganisms in the soil consume oxygen to break down the organic matter in the soil, creating a reducing environment.

The wooden frame wall construction method is a box-shaped structure in which load-bearing walls and rigid floors are rigidly integrated, and is supported by walls and floors (facing materials) made of framed wood to which structural plywood is laminated, whereas the [[wooden frame construction method]] is supported by shafts (linear materials) such as posts and beams.
