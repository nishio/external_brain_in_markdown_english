I have seen Mr. Anno's new work as an artist, "Self-Identity Flexibility Gymnastics".
It was a "gymnastics exercise" created by Deep Fake, where one's self-identity is stretched and becomes more flexible while feeling pain when one sees people who look different from oneself doing the same movements as oneself. I could not contain my laughter.

Why do I generate laughter? Am I trying to trivialize what is happening in front of me by laughing? Are the bumps on the surface of my physical body part of my identity? Or are they simply assumptions and conventions? The mystery only deepens.

It featured people-created through deep fake-with faces different from mine yet performing the same movements as I do.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890792809768145351) This artwork was described as a kind of "flexibility exercise" in which one’s self-identity is stretched, causing pain, but also becoming more flexible. I couldn’t stop laughing. #Plurality

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890794634827210900) Why do I laugh? Am I trying to trivialize what’s happening right in front of me by laughing? Are the bumps and contours on the surface of my physical body part of my identity, or are they merely assumptions and conventions? The mystery only deepens.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890919130011672694) When I told my wife about Mr. Yasuno and Ms. Yamane's "self-identity flexibility exercises," she said, "That's what it means to have [[dementia]]. I think I am in my 30s, but in the mirror there is an old man who moves the same way as me, and the people around me treat me like an old man.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1890919770771296705) Yesterday on the air, they were talking about how some of the early ideas were "[[I'm]] getting old and dying in the mirror," but maybe that's the dementia perspective.
