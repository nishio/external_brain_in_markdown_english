I think this is a good way to operate [[a community that produces something useful]], but I don't know...
- [[Community management]] / [[Community]]

The resolution of "Splendor in the Fence" is low.
- Is it "fun" or "smell of money"?
    - Sending out "[[interest]]" is beneficial for [[making the community dense]] because it attracts [[people who find the same things interesting]].
    - Sending out "[[smell of money]]" is harmful because it brings in [[money-grubbers]] and diminishes community resources.
- In other words, is it better to let people think, "I see someone is sticking their time in [[Interest Driven]] for [[things that don't make money]]," and then when the smell of money leaks out, they can't get in anymore?

- After all these years, I thought the term "smell of money" seemed a little too peculiar.
- I think "[[usefulness]]" is about right.

2023-03-04
    - [[brilliance]] → [[make something shine]] → [[make a display (e.g. of wealth)]]

relevance
    - [[Gates should be hidden.]]
    - [[gate]]
    - [[A squeal of "I'm sad I didn't make it into the festivities."]]
