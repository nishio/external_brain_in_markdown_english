- The connection between [[banning]] people who troll the [[Community]] and "[[leaving]] no one behind".

Arrangement of purpose
- No one is left behind" (a value embodied in the SDGs) aims for a state of safety and opportunity for people of diverse backgrounds.
- Ban (exclusion) is the final enforcement action taken by a community against an act that seriously violates the rights or safety of others.
Although the two appear to be at odds with each other, in practice they are on the same footing and work complementary to each other as means of protecting "inclusion.

Community "fundamental rights" and hierarchies
_
| Level Objective Typical measures |
| -- |
| Safety & Dignity Protect everyone from harassment and violence Moderation, ban, emergency stop |
| Visibility/voice Equal opportunity to speak Thread separation, translation/accessibility |
| Growth and learning Understanding rules and improving skills Onboarding and mentoring |
If the top level, "safety and dignity," is breached, the lower levels cannot function.
Thus, a sequential relationship arises: in order to "leave no one behind," it is first necessary to restrict behaviors that threaten safety.

No one is left behind" does not mean "allowing anything" but "including everyone within a framework that protects their safety and dignity.

Prompt isolation and care is the prerequisite for inclusion. The hierarchy is clearly stated that the protection of the victim should take precedence over the protection of the perpetrator.

- Ideally, o3 says, it would be better to listen to and educate the person with problematic behavior without taking the time to argue with him or her, but realistically, it's not a good objective to devote resources to that person, is it?
    - This is the difference between a place where people just exist and an organization that achieves its goals
    - When a place isn't created for the purpose of inclusion, it's normal to ban people who are negative to achieve the goal.
