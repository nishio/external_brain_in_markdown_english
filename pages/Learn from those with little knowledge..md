### Summary of notes
.
This note contains a discussion of knowledge distribution maps. The vertical axis shows the amount of knowledge and the horizontal axis shows the knowledge areas. It also presents the idea that one can learn from those with less knowledge, from the opposite perspective of those with more knowledge teaching.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The fragment "Radar Charts and Distribution Charts of Knowledge" is directly related to the note. The note describes a distribution map of knowledge, and the fragment states that the radar chart and the knowledge distribution map represent almost the same thing. The fragment "Learning even from those with little knowledge" is also consistent with the subject matter of the note.

### deep thinking
A knowledge distribution map can be a useful tool to visualize the diversity of knowledge and its distribution. However, it can also be seen as making an implicit assumption as if a portion of knowledge can be cut out and measured in one dimensional values. The notion that one can learn from those with less knowledge also underscores the importance of diversity in the knowledge exchange and learning process.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
Knowledge Distribution Charts and Learning Diversity: The idea that knowledge distribution charts are a tool to visualize the diversity of knowledge and that one can learn from those with less knowledge underscores the importance of diversity in the knowledge exchange and learning process.
