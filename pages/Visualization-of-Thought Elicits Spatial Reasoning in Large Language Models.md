<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>In this paper, a prompting technique called [[Visualization-of-Thought]] (VoT) is proposed to improve the [[spatial reasoning capability]] of large-scale language models (LLMs). The main contents are as follows.
- VoT is a method to make LLM imitate [[spatial inference]] by human "[[mind's eye]]". It elicits spatial inference by performing [[visualization (data, results, etc.)]] at each inference step and guiding subsequent steps.
2. evaluated the effectiveness of VoT in three tasks: natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling; VoT significantly improved the spatial inference capability of LLMs in these tasks, outperforming existing multimodal LLMs.
3. developed two new tasks and datasets for "visual navigation" and "visual tiling" in a 2D grid world. These will be suitable testbeds for the study of spatial reasoning with varying complexity.
- 4.[[Mental image generation]] by VoT resembles the human mind's eye, suggesting its potential application to multimodal LLM.
5. experiments with GPT-4 demonstrated the effectiveness of VoT; quantitative and qualitative analysis of LLM's ability to generate mental images was conducted, and its limitations were also discussed.

- How to emulate thoughts using [[scenery in one's mind's eye]] in the LLM
- If this can be done, then the current LLM can do [[KJ method]].
