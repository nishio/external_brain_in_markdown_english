> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1814915030871097361) [[AI politicians]] three levels
>  1: Just tell people what [[politicians]] put out and don't listen to them
>  2: Listening and interacting with people, but that information is not being passed on to politicians
>  3: People's stories get passed on to politicians, who can update their ideas and information
