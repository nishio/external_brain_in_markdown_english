> Citrus unshiuensis (scientific name: [[Citrus unshiu]]) is an evergreen shrub of the tangerine family or its fruit. It is a type of citrus that is said to originate in Kagoshima Prefecture. There are various cultivars and brand names depending on the region of origin. The fruit is edible and has no seeds, giving it a lighter flavor than oranges.
>  Name
>  In modern times, "[[mikan]]" usually refers to the unshu mandarin orange. The Japanese name "unshu-mikan" comes from a popular belief that the variety was created in Japan by sowing seeds from Wenzhou (Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, which is said to be the origin of mandarin oranges in the Sangokushi Yanyi and other stories), but the origin of this variety is believed to be Nagashima in the Satsuma region (present Kagoshima Prefecture) of Japan, and it was not introduced from Wenzhou. This does not mean that it was introduced from Onshu.

>  "In English, this species is called satsuma mandarin. In Europe and the United States, the common names are "[[Satsuma]]" and "[[Mikan]]. The name "satsuma" is derived from the fact that this species was introduced from the Satsuma region of Kagoshima Prefecture to Florida in the United States in 1876. Later, this species was introduced to the U.S. from the Owari area in Aichi Prefecture, where it was also known as "Owari satsuma.
>  The Citrus reticulata is closely related to the tangerine orange ([[Tangerine]]) and mandarin orange ([[Mandarin orange]]) (both scientific names are Citrus reticulata), and is a cultivar derived from these two species.
