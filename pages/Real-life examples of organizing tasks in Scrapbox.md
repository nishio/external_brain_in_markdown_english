title: "Real-life examples of organizing tasks in Scrapbox"
---

step1
- Write what comes to mind
- Page title is appropriate
- A link to this appropriately titled page has been placed on the task list (forgot to take a screencap).

step2
- Use bullet points to bite off specific things to do.
    - In the process of chewing it up, I realized I was mistaken.

step3
- Draw a line and write a bite at the top of the page based on your new understanding

- Scrapbox's auto-updating links change the way task lists are displayed.

step5
- Another task may unexpectedly occur during implementation
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7a495f07da77833482dcb4438525d39b/thumb/1000)
- Revisions and considerations for this task should be written down as they may be useful later
- This task is "relevant" because it occurred while the original task was being processed.
- On the other hand, it doesn't have much to do with the purpose of the original task, etc.
    - If it is written on the page of the original task, the topic is long overdue.
    - → put it on a separate page

step6
- Task completed.
- Update title pictograms
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/c1d91c493e45d9a4cdc9b0f5e03087a6/thumb/1000)
- The list is also automatically updated.
