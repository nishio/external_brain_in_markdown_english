- Characters: Hora and Tempus, master watchmakers
- Product: High-end watch with approx. 1,000 parts per piece
- Condition: Phone rings frequently and work is often interrupted

tempus
- Assemble 1,000 parts at once from start to finish
- If you let go of your hand in the middle of a task, everything falls apart and you have to start all over again from the beginning.
hey!
- 10 Parts → Create and fix small units
- 10 small units → medium units
- 10 medium units → complete
- The unit does not collapse when placed in the middle of the process, and resumption starts at that stage.

Result: Tempus resets every time the phone rings, but Hola thrives because it can reopen with very little loss, and Tempus goes out of business.

Key Lessons Learned -- The Power of Hierarchy and Modularity
- Hierarchical partitioning (resolution)
    - Dividing a large problem into stable "subassemblies" makes it more resistant to disturbances and exponentially reduces the search space.
- Almost independent" subsystems
    - Strong coupling within each unit and weak coupling between units → to a structure that [[Herbert Simon.]] later called "[[near decomposable systems]]".
- Speed of evolution and learning
    - If the intermediate form is stable, "trial and error with conservation" is possible, and the probability and time required to create a complex system can be dramatically improved.

summary
- The fable of the two watchmakers has a universal message: "Divide things, organizations, and knowledge into units that cannot be broken down along the way, and build up reusable blocks. Today, when interruptions and environmental changes are commonplace, the hora-like approach--[[stratification]], [[modularization]], and [[securing a stable intermediate form]]--is the key to achievement and sustainability. The key to success and sustainability is the holistic approach.
