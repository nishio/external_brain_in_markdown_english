title: "Irreconcilable arguments are sterile."
---

When you see people on social networking sites claiming that something you think is "X" is "not X," you might be tempted to argue with them, but once you get into the "X v. s. X" composition, it's logically irreconcilable, so you shouldn't focus on that.

A common pattern is "[[implicit assumption]] is discrepant" and "the [[meaning]] that the word X refers to is different." But this is a two-way street, so you should look at yourself first before pointing it out to the other person.

When I look at myself, I can say, "I think I am X if I make the assumption that I am ~, but you make a different assumption?" or "I am using X to mean ~...".

Incompatible [[discussion]] is [[barren]].
