title: "What we want to do and what we can do"
---

What I [[want to do]] cannot be taught by others, so I have to verbalize it myself.
What you "relatively [[are made]] better than others," or "[[forte]]" is, surprisingly, something that others know better than you do. You may not feel pain when others feel pain, you may not feel fear when others feel fear, and others may not take what you take for granted for granted. Because that is a strength.

So, "[[Unexpected Success]]" is useful in knowing one's strengths.

On the other hand, remember that it is only [[Evaluation by others]], so it is not what you want to do

- [[Hungry for recognition]] Sometimes we are so happy to be recognized that we do whatever is appreciated. That is inevitable, and it is beneficial to do it temporarily, but the self does not exist as an extension of that. The self is rather at the root.
