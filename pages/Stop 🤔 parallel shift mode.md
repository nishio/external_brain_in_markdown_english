Stop switching to 🤔parallel movement mode
- Stop switching to parallel mode when doing a parallel move.
    - Refine the way you do things without switching.
- Conclusion that "Try using shift drag" doesn't work in lasso mode.
    - 🤔 shift-drag in lasso mode for parallel shift.
        - In parallel movement mode, shift-drag was zoom.
        - Obviously a source of confusion.
- Then change the parallel shift mode to "[[ROM mode]]".
    - This will also solve what Mr. Kawai said before, "I'm afraid of operating it because I might accidentally break it.
- When co-editing, you can prevent casual conflicts by making sure that when someone goes into edit mode, the others go into ROM mode.
    - I'm starting to think things are starting to add up.
