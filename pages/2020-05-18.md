- Duplicate paths when selecting and grouping paths and stickies
    - When grouping, it removes the selected item from the existing item, because "existing item" is a path and the selected item is a group containing paths?
    - Reverse.
    - Should this be fixed at the grouping or not...
    - A situation where a path group with 1 element and a single path can be mixed.
        - Not good...
    - The duplicate path issue is tricky, so I'll have to put devtool in there first.
- Ungrouped when pasting
    - Because the selected path is not a group.
    - Should I group them when pasting?
