title: "Difference between worrying and thinking"
---

from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 20200825]]
- Difference between [[be worried]] and [consider
- It bothers me, but [[No idea.]] There are people
- What is thinking?
        - [Trying to create a bond.
- Even if you haven't put it all together yet (i.e., you haven't discovered the bond), you can output it if you have collected the materials for the bond.
    - I can answer a large amount of cluttered data when asked to explain what is bothering me.
    - Some people can't answer, because they haven't thought it through.
    - Write down what's bothering you on a whiteboard, make sticky notes, etc.
    - We go seeking new information in the hope that the new information will combine with what we are currently thinking
- Conversely, there are cases where "[[I'm not worried.]]" people are just jumping to the conclusion at hand without thinking it through.
