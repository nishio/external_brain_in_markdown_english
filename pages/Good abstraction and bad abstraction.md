Good abstraction and bad abstraction
[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677861710789775367?s=20](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677861710789775367?s=20)
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1677861710789775367) I interpreted "A is A" as the subtitle of the third part of the Atlas of Shrugging Shoulders, and "The Art of the Betting Booth" as drawing out private investment, am I correct?

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1677894502093316096) Interesting w yes, mine is correct. I was using it to separate it from the general usage and to limit it.

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1677908727138074625) Since we're at it (?) I'd like to add a few more "intuitions" to help cultivate ChaGPT.

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1677913112735895553) So what is a good abstract B? About. This time, I interpreted that the criterion for a good abstract is "[[whether it is based on concrete]]", and brought up "[[A is A]]" as a verification tool.

>  1. abstract B has not deviated from the original concrete of abstract A
>  2. abstract B is an association from abstract A. The original concrete does not apply, but it can be applied to another concrete.

> [_tea_two](https://twitter.com/_tea_two/status/1677913899671207938) I think this story is about 1 in particular being preferable, but "A is A" itself can be used for 2 as well. That is all.
