A community that doesn't care if you go through with it.
- N:
    - > "So, if a speaker offers a topic that no one is interested in, everyone skips reading it?" Yes, and then the speaker automatically leaves the community.
    - Supplementation needed here.
    - If there is no expectation that others should respond immediately to what you say, there is no reason to leave the community even if there is no immediate response; asynchronous communication via text may be responded to after a period of time

- T: I understand that, but as a human being, if no one responds to you for three whole days, you may think, "Oh, maybe I said something boring..." and get depressed. I think there are a lot of people who feel depressed because they think, "[[Oh, maybe I said something boring]].

- N: Seems to recognize that "[[no one has responded yet]]"
    - And I think when you're outputting every day, [[you don't care much about what happened three days ago]].
    - cf. [[The value of a text is not determined by whether it is responsive in the short term]].

- T: I mean, [[I think]] only people who are okay with being through for a few days will remain in a community that is through for a few days.

- N: I suppose it would.

- T: I thought of something like this, so I'll leave it here!
    - I don't care if there is a response or not!
    - I think there are very few people out there who can do it!
    - There are those who cannot write to [[the void]] and those who can.
        - [[Writing to the void]]
- N: In that sense, there are people who say, "I've started a blog! and then they write about 3 articles and quit because they don't get any comments.
    - [[Expecting a response is a mistake]].
    - A lot of VTubers seem to be falling behind too.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I remember the other day, there was a story about a neighbor who was doing a delivery...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>
- T: If a community has a [[culture of throughness]], I'm sure everyone shares that premise.
    - Oh, we came back to the same place.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
