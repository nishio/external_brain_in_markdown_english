Q: What is enchi?
A: 「 [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]] 」のコンテンツを用いた実験場です<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Originally, it was an experiment in [[active reading]], a new form of reading using Scrapbox.
- The term [[Dialogue in the Book]] was born because books and people are no longer one-on-one.
- In 2023, I feel that something new could be created using generative AI as dynamic content rather than books as static content
