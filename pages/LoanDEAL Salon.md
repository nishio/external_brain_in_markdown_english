I was invited by Seki-san to attend a social event for transferees of [[LoanDEAL]], where I am a mentor. The meeting was for people who have completed their transfer period to talk about their experiences in front of people who are in the process of transferring or who will be transferring in the future. The transferees get a "human network at the new venture" and a "human network of people who transferred at the same time" at the same time.

Aside from the venture experience during the transfer period, the connections they make with the outside world in this way will make them great [[information flow paths into the company]]. The network created in this way will create great value five to ten years down the road.

Gray is the company boundary. People who belong to the company form a network across the company by sticking out and belonging to the temporary community enclosed by the red dotted line.
