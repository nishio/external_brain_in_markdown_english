- [[Objective.]] [[layered structure]].
- For a given purpose, "Why are we doing it?" for a certain purpose, [[Upper Purpose]] comes into play.
- For a given objective, "How do we do that?" [[Subordinate Objectives]] when you think about it.
- For a given objective X, "Why do it?" and after the higher-level objective Y comes up, "But the way to achieve it doesn't have to be X, right?" and X may disappear.
- When you think about your personal purpose, you may ask yourself "Why? and finally come to the conclusion that "there is no reason, I do what I do because I want to do it", which is called "Purpose of Life" or "[[values]]".
- [[OKR]] considers a hierarchy between the goals of an organization and the goals of individuals who belong to that organization.
    - But it implicitly assumes [[Inclusion of organizations and individuals]].
        - That is a false premise in the age of [[parallel work]].
