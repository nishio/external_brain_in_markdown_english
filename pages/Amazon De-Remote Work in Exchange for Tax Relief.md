title: "Amazon De-Remote Work in Exchange for Tax Relief"
---

[[Amazon]]'s claim that de- [[remote work]] is an exchange for tax relief.
> Amazon receives massive tax incentives from the cities and states where they have offices. In theory, how this works is that Amazon gets a tax break, people get jobs, the place becomes a booming tech town (like Seattle), homeowners benefit, local officials benefit, local business owners benefit, and everyone makes themselves rich.
>  However, cities and states have no incentive to continue to release Amazon from tax exemptions if their offices remain empty and their downtowns continue to be desolate and abandoned. If Amazon continues to allow remote work, the tax commissioner will come knocking and they will be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.

I think it's actually a combination of factors, not just one obvious factor, but many, including myself, seem to overlook the tax aspect, so I'll note it.
