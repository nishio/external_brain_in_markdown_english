[[Opinion Traceability]] has two directions
- Now [[public information AI]] has traceability from "final report" to "original post" direction
    - It allows you to show that what is written in the report is based on "someone else's" opinion.
- But no traceability in the direction from "original submission" to "final report".
    - I can't find out where "I" put what I wrote in the report.
    - [[Requires traceability in both directions]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>You raise a good issue. The word "traceability" conveys the meaning, but depending on the nuance, other phrases may be more appropriate. To summarize, it can be summarized as follows.

1. traceability
- Originally means "traceability" or "retraceability". It is often used in the manufacturing and food sectors.
- It can be used for one-way tracing of "Report → Submit" without any discomfort.
- However, "Submission → Report" is meant to indicate "where the impact appeared", so "traceability" alone is somewhat weak.

2. other candidate expressions
- "Reference Relationships."
Emphasizes that the link is bi-directional. Similar to "cross-referencing" in technical documents.
- Correspondence
Indicate where the submission and the report description correspond. Easy to understand for the general reader.
- Origin Indication" / "Source Indication"
Nuances indicating where the submission was reflected in the report.
- Visualizing Contributions."
From the contributor's point of view, highlight how his/her opinion was reflected. This goes along with the visualization of the contribution.
- Impact Mapping."
Image to map how the original submission affected the final outcome.

3. expression of recommendation
- In a technical context, "[[bi-directional traceability]]" or "[[bi-directional reference relationship]]".
- In the civic participation and democratic context, "[[avenues for reflecting opinions]]" and "[[making contributions visible]]".
