<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to put Keichobot in context.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "[[Keichobot]]" is that "[[Keichobot]]"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Listen first.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The problem is that "[[A blur that cannot be put into words properly]]" is particularly problematic because it is not circulated until it becomes words. The visibility of "A blur that cannot be put into words properly" misleads people into believing that it is all there is to an opinion.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It tends to be the responsibility of individuals to verbalize and transmit their mumbo-jumbo, but many individuals feel that they are not good at it. The advantage of an organization is to increase productivity as a whole by having those around you cover for the individual's unskillfulness.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The human-powered solution to this is to "listen to them," and discussions of good listening techniques have been held, with names such as "[[listening closely]]" and "[[coaching]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Listening.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This can create a quality experience if the listener is trained to "not impose his/her opinion," etc., but using [[a flesh-and-blood person]] is expensive.

- What does this "blur" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The sea, like the primordial sea in Mesopotamian mythology, is a sea of fertility, a sea that gives birth to many things, itself chaos, clean fresh water flowing into it, giving birth to diverse gods, which in turn shaped the world.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Tiamat]].
    - > Tiamat, the primordial sea goddess in Mesopotamian mythology. She intermarried with the freshwater god Apsuu and gave birth to younger gods. For example, Tiamat produced the goddess Raham, who was paired with the curly-haired male goddess Rahum, who brought forth blessings, and the siblings Anshal and Kishal, called the progenitors of the next generation of gods, who in turn produced new gods, the next generation of gods, including Anu, who later became the sky god. She is the symbol of chaos in the primordial creation...
    - >  After defeating Tiamat, Marduk took the "Book of Heaven's Life Version" from Kingu and applied Kingu's blood to the "creation of man" to shoulder the labor of the gods, while Tiamat's corpse was dismembered from its remains to be used as material for the "creation of heaven and earth". It is said that they were torn in two, each becoming the heavens and the earth, and that the breast became a mountain (and a spring was created near it), and from its eye arose the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Thus the mother god Tiamat became the basis of the world. [Tiamat - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ティアマト)
    - The earlier connection with the resource symbol "moyamoya is a treasure trove" has changed the metaphor "ocean" to the resource symbol "sea of fertility."
    - And combined with the historical metaphor of Mesopotamian mythology
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
- How do you know this "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You can tell by the way the words come out and it feels right.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "words" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Words are acquired through learning with "institutionalized" meanings. However, when we are faced with a "blur" that cannot be explained in words, there are no appropriate institutionalized words to express the blur. Therefore, existing words are used to express the new experience, and this is Eugene Gendlin's metaphorical creation of meaning.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Here we talk about [[institutionalized language]], then [[faltering in one's speech]] and [Eugene Gendlin's Metaphor Concept
    - As for good stammering, Scrapbox doesn't explain it very well, [[Parable of the Gears]] and others are relevant. When a question is answered quickly, it's not so much the answer that matters, but the good stutter, the words spun after thinking for a while, that have value.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "blur" when that "word" is used?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If the words and the moyamoya are "compared" and they feel right, the moyamoya is expressed in words and disappears. On the other hand, if you still feel a sense of discomfort, compare the words with the fuzziness and dig deeper to find out what is the same and what is different, and the fuzziness will be broken down into smaller pieces.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>By "compare," I'm thinking of [[direct comparison]].
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is between the "word" and the "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(This is a tough question...)
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is exactly what a "good thud" looks like.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Sometimes a probabilistic spontaneous occurrence can occur from a state of moyamoya, but it is inefficient to leave it to luck and wait for it to happen. In Mesopotamian mythology, fresh water flows in, and in the case of my sea and fish metaphor, casting a net, or in the current implementation of Keichobot, the software is trying to increase the probability of words being produced from the miasma by asking clean questions
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The sea and fish metaphor compares verbalization to "catching a fish in the sea.
        - [[Hooks to fish for what has not yet been verbalized.]]
    - Here, the fish is hooked (the image of a harpoon with a string attached), but in the initial stage, the fish is not visible, so it is impossible to throw a harpoon at the fish. It is more appropriate to think of it as throwing a net in a fluffy manner. Throwing a harpoon has the nuance of "if it doesn't sting, it's an NG" and causes the false perception that the question must be answered. Test metaphor. Rather, there is a question, and even if you can't answer it, you get a hint that "there are no fish in this area right now.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the "word" during that "blur"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Words acquire new meanings.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with regard to that "word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It is not beneficial just to create new meanings for words or new meanings for words. It is like a child thinking of a cool special move name. It is profitable when the [[new combination]] of words and meanings created brings about an economic benefit to the thought.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> By [[thought economy]], [[Ernst Mach]] means that concepts are created to lower the cost of thought. And when the created concept actually lowers the cost of thinking, it is economical and beneficial, then [[pragmatism]] is correct. There are opinions that look to foundation or consistency as a basis for correctness, but both are inappropriate here because we are creating a new combination of words and meanings.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "word" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In the case of a word that is understood only by an individual, the use of the word as a tool for thinking needs to cause an increase in the efficiency of thinking. In the case of words that are used by multiple people, the words need to cause a reduction in communication costs. (Of course, it is preferable if this indirectly improves the efficiency of the organization's thinking and the thinking of individual members of the organization.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This can be paraphrased as the economic benefits of thought
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "the word"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This is a [[self-challenge]]. Some words will be, some will not. It is not something that "does"; it is something that "becomes" some of the many that are created. At least through repeated calibration meetings with Mr. Tachikawa, the phenomenon of the actual creation of that kind of thought-economy-like language has become an observable fact.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This "becoming" is the story of [[Becoming]] and "Making" in [Introduction to Anti-Philosophy
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "word" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>(Oh, I see, what is it like? This is a very important question. I can't think of an answer right away, but if I can answer this, I guess I'll be good to call it a day. My first thought was "this is exactly what the word is", but I don't feel like that says anything.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought, "It looks like a cog." The explanation as to why it is a cog has yet to emerge, but that will come later.
