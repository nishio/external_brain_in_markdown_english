- Person A and Person B, who have taken different paths, can exchange the different knowledge they have acquired and mutually benefit from it.
- Person C, who remains stationary, does not possess new knowledge to offer for exchange, thus cannot engage in an equal exchange.
    - What patterns exist?
        - Use money as compensation
        - Offer [[attention]] as compensation to those who [[want to attract attention]]
            - Often, information is distorted by the incentive that "it's more attention-grabbing to say [[something extreme]]"
        - Wait for information to be released for free by those who do so for the public good
