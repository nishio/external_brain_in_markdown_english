title: "selective marital separation"
---

> The [[(system of) selective marital separation]] is a system that allows married couples to continue to use their respective clan names after marriage if they so desire. This system is generally referred to as "the [[(system of) selective marital separation]] system," but since the Civil Code and other laws refer to "family name" and "surname" as "clan," the Ministry of Justice refers to it as the "selective married couple separate clan system.
