#keep4o About the Movement
- I can sympathize with the sadness of those who felt attached to 4o and lost it in the upgrade.
- On the other hand, in order for something to be maintained, a maintenance fee should be paid, and if you were using it for free, you are in no position to complain!
        - [[Who pays the maintenance costs?]]

OpenAI has [[antagonized]] as a result of giving 4o for free and then taking it away.
- Should we not have given it to them in the first place?
- Sam Altman's philosophy is that it's not good for some people to have a monopoly on AI, so he gives it away for free.
