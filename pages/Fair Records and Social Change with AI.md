- When AI compiled the minutes of the meeting, it sometimes failed to record what one person said. In discussing this, the new concept of "[[AI harassment]]" is mentioned, suggesting that perceptions are changing about how AI can preserve or create social fairness or injustice.


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Q: Why didn't you include Mr. X's statement in your summary?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- We determined that X's statement did not directly affect the main flow of the conversation.
- With A, B, and C playing a central role in the work, we thought we could make the summary more compact by focusing on their interactions.
- To keep the summary concise, we focused on extracting the main flow of work and key points, rather than including all participants' statements.


[[Summary is a value judgment]], so if it's a "worthless statement" from the AI's point of view, then of course it will be ignored.
- What does [[fair record]] mean by [[chopped burdock root (and sometimes carrot) cooked in sugar and soy sauce]]?
    - [[If you communicate via AI, harassment will not occur.]] but people who say that [[being ignored by AI]] is harassment can occur.
