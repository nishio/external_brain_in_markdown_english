- Converting an angle to a ratio of x and y is tangent
- Conversely, converting the ratio of x and y into an angle is arc tangent
    - Also written as $\tan^{-1}$ or atan depending on the environment

- However, since $\frac{y}{x} = \frac{-y}{-x}$, this method also identifies points 180 degrees opposite
    - Same reason why the tangent graph is 180 degree periodic.
- If you want to restore 360 degrees
    - Information is lost when the ratio is taken, so the information before the ratio is taken must be used.
    - For example if (x > 0) ... else if (x == 0 and y > 0) ... else if (x == 0 and y < 0) ... else if (x < 0) and divide into cases
