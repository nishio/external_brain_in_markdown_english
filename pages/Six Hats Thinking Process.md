- Six hats represent [point of view
    - White hat Objective facts and data
    - Red hat Anger, passion, emotional perspective
    - Black hat Earnest and thoughtful, alert and careful, pointing out weaknesses in thinking
    - Yellow hat Bright, positive, optimistic, hope and positive thinking
    - Green caps Images of plants, fruitful growth, creativity and the birth of new ideas
    - Blue hat calmness, color of the sky, image of transcendence, composing the process of thinking or controlling the use of other hats

pair
- White and Red
- Black and yellow
- Green and Blue
    - This is the only subtle one.

Compare with [Four-Player Framework
- Bystander is blue
- Opposer is black
- I think Mover is green and Follower is yellow.
- The rest.
    - Red may Follower or Opposer emotionally.
    - White may calmly Follower or Opposer with data.
    - Okay, the red-white axis seems to be going straight.

- In this book, it is translated as [[parallel thinking]], but is it the same as [[lateral thinking]]?
    - Is it different from the horizontal thinking of "lateral" because it is pretended to be "parallel?"
    - There's a chapter on horizontal thinking in the chapter on green hats, which is different.
        - The word imagination is ambiguous; it is imagination that creates confusion and harmony.
        - Horizontal thinking is "pattern transformation of asymmetric exchange systems."
            - > just as logical thinking is based on the principle of action in a symbolic language (a particular worldview).
            - > Horizontal thinking is based on the behavioral principles of pattern systems (also a particular worldview)
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is a translation that the translator doesn't understand.
            - I think he means symbol manipulation.
