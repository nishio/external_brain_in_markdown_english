Replacing constants with functions

Can't we think of that constant as actually a "function that always takes a constant value"? Can't we solve the problem by extending it to a general function?
The application of Riemannian geometry, in which the curvature of space is not constant, to physics gave rise to Einstein's general theory of relativity.

### Summary of notes
.
It explores the possibility of solving problems by viewing constants as functions that take constant values and extending them to general functions. This idea led to the application of the nonconstant curvature property of space in Riemannian geometry to physics and the creation of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment 1013, "Replacing Constants with Functions," is directly related to the note. The content of the note and Fragment 1013 illustrate the same idea, providing a new perspective on problem solving by viewing constants as functions that take on constant values.

### deep thinking
This concept shows the possibility of looking at things from a new perspective and finding solutions that are invisible to traditional problem-solving methods. By viewing a constant as a function that takes a constant value, we may be able to maximize the potential it holds.
