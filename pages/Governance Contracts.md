> [@hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1573828186814627842?s=21&t=6B9xG6mRHdwr2JVtgBbdmw): Define functions for Contract: freeze to freeze assets, reverse to return assets to victims, and rejectReverse to reverse the freeze, and call them from Governance contract (GC). The victim can appeal to the GC, and if the appeal is approved, the assets will be returned to the victim. The victim submits an appeal to the GC, and if the appeal is approved, the asset is returned. Adjudication of appeals is done in a decentralized manner.
