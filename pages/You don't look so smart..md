title: "You don't look so smart."
---

A "People who use the word X don't seem smart."
B "People who make the statement, 'People who use the word ~ don't seem to be smart' don't seem to be smart either."

- [[boomerang joke]]

from [/villagepump/words that seem unwise](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/words that seem unwise).
If someone says they feel like they don't look smart, I don't think they need to conform to that at all.
- "Someone X said, 'People who use the word A don't seem smart'" is not equal to "People who use the word A are not smart."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I mean, the real problem is that X may not be smart enough...
    - The statement "People who use the word ~ don't seem smart." doesn't seem smart! (Boomerang!)
