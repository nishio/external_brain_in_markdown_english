title: "Human Inertia"
---

- In physics, there are phenomena in which a moving object keeps moving in the same direction or a stationary object keeps stopping.
- This is called the law of inertia.
- Humans have such inertial movements and non-inertial movements that start moving in new directions that are not so inertial.
- The organization strengthens [[inertia]].
    - Suppose there are three people who have a 60% chance of choosing "[[maintenance of the status quo]]" and a 40% chance of choosing "[[reform]]".
    - Individually, 40% of the time, we choose to change.
    - If these three people take a majority vote...
        - All maintain status quo: 22
        - 2 maintain status quo: 42%.
        - 2 people transformed: 29%.
        - All transformed: 6%.
    - and the probability that the status quo will be chosen increases.
        - [[majority rule]] strengthens the majority option.
        - It would be interesting to visualize how the increase in the number of people biases the majority #Experiment needed
        - On the other hand, a majority for "change" would strengthen it.
            - Call it "company culture," but dominant design in decision-making.
            - Example: "If an improvement fails, do not undo it, but improve it further." Toyota Production Capability: The Ultimate Wisdom of Monozukuri.
    - This calculation was a choice between "maintenance of the status quo or change," but in the form of a proposal and discussion, it could happen that the change proposal differs in a case where "more than one person chose change," making it even more likely that "[[maintenance of the status quo]]" will be chosen.
        - We can alleviate that a bit by making the choice "first, maintain the status quo or change."

- It is inevitable that [[inertia]] will be stronger in an organization that has been maintained for many years.
