> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1801856440145219827) We have extracted questions from the minutes of the 2023-24 Metropolitan Assembly and used AI to analyze and report on the "issues of the Metropolitan Assembly". We will deepen our understanding of the overall picture of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and where it is now, and determine "what we should focus on now" carefully.
>  We will continue to examine policies from various angles.
