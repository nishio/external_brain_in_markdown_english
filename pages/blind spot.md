title: "blind spot"
---

- When people learn, they first need to [[notice]] that they "don't know yet.
    - In learning with textbooks, you may see "learning" as the act of taking something outside of yourself that you need to learn and incorporating it into yourself, because the textbooks contain a lot of "things you don't know yet".
        - [[Learning without textbooks]], you must first discover what you don't know.
    - Referring to this, Nishio expresses that "in order to learn, we must first become aware of our blind spots.

- You don't see it, but you don't know you don't see it. That is the blind spot.

- Between the "obviously know" area and the "obviously don't know" area lies the "don't know what you don't know."
