- I'm fed up with formulas that are hard to understand.
    - Appropriate handling of symbols
    - Please stop omitting the integral range.
        - What area are you dividing?
        - In case you read the successive integrals that come up in the equation transformation right after, you can finally see where I wanted to integrate and what I wanted to do.
            - I want you to write first.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- It's faster to rewrite it from scratch yourself.
    - Whether it is early or not.[[understanding]] は深くなりそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The word "early" was inaccurate.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - A closer representation would be, "It is easier to move my hand if I translate the expression into the [[symbolic system]] that I normally use before expanding it, rather than expanding it with the symbols that the textbook uses."
            - I feel like I'm just stating the obvious.
            - Does this mean I'm not learning new concepts?
                - [/enchi/1.3.4.5 When you need sutra again](https://scrapbox.io/enchi/1.3.4.5 When you need sutra again)(private)
                        - [[(1.3.4.5) When the sutra is needed again]]
                - But I have only learned the symbolic rules in the textbooks, but not the content of the theory (in this case [[Stability conditions of floating bodies in hydrostatics]]), so is that a problem?
                - If you're so focused on rewriting symbols that you don't have the substance of the theory in your head, that's a problem, but if you don't, why not?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - I'd rather rewrite it and clear it up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - Also, it's interesting to see more and more areas that aren't explained well enough.
                    - When it's written in unfamiliar symbols, it's unconscious.[[Cognitive Resolution]] を落としたり [[skimming]] たりしちゃうのだと思う<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

                        - You skipped reading it in the first place.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>

                                - Resolution to the extent that when Topic A is dumped, it comes right out and says, "You know, the verification column for this was at the end of Chapter N of Book B.
                            - (As for formulas) I have to rewrite everything in my own symbols to understand it.
                                - And re-draw all the diagrams.
                - Whether something expressed in a symbol system A is transformed within that symbol form, or whether it is transferred to symbol system B and then transformed
                    - I want something that gets me to the right answer fast.
                    - When tackling a problem with no correct answer, the wider the search area, the better the chance of reaching the correct answer.
                    - Better to use both A and B than to use only A.

                        - I think it's a kind of [[fast travel in the knowledge network]], where there's a network in symbol system B, and you can use that for fast travel.
    - I used to encourage my brain to reconstruct the board by daring to use a different layout when transcribing it into my notebook.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
