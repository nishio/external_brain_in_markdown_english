[Who spread the posts of each political party (Fujio Toriumi) - Expert - Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/1109453487abd2c5744bd0f737d3566fd22c67b7)
- I'd write down the URL, but since it's voting day, I didn't want to link to it just in case. w
    - No, I'm not supporting a particular political party, is that okay?
- I made it a link since the date changed.

I'll organize the weekly journal tomorrow.
- When I organize today, I'm inevitably going to have to mention certain party activities.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946588672498835646) Everyone was working with their hands until the last minute. It was an interesting festival. Looking forward to seeing the results.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946724139479548365) Who thought of a system where after the festival is over, everyone who contributed will be shown in the end roll. And there's another scene after the end roll, isn't there, like Nausicaa?


> [letejada](https://x.com/letejada/status/1946258012739674185) Go vote, Japanese!
>  If you don't vote, come to Africa!
>  I'll let you experience real crazy politics.
> [heroyattin](https://x.com/heroyattin/status/1946268866230800538) You are very convincing.
>  Current President of Cameroon
>  Mr. Paul Biya
>  ■Age: 92 years old
>  Oldest living head of state in the world (among living heads of state in office at age 90)
>  ■Tenure: 42 years

> [philomyu](https://x.com/philomyu/status/1946595191860998475) Personally, I'm of the "democracy is really important" school of thought before I care about any party, so I want everyone to go to the voting booth in the worst possible mood and write down the names of strangers they see on the spot. I want everyone to go to the polls and write down the name of a stranger they see on the spot, and then be happy or angry when that person fails, wins, or does something good or bad after winning.
>  >philomyu: I think there's a common thing that happens on election day, "I start watching election specials while drinking alcohol, and when I'm happy or sad that someone I support or personally find unforgivable has been accepted or rejected, I realize it's late at night and the first MTG the next morning is too sleepy". I can enjoy democracy without any worries.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946751127166570736) Voting in House of Councillors election "must go" increases among younger voters Voter turnout expected to exceed previous election

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946167645239136425) Japan appears to be the last bastion of democracy, Taiwan's former Digital Minister Audrey Tan says
>  >[hal_sk](https://x.com/hal_sk/status/1946167645239136425) With democracy down to the Cold War era, can Japan, a relatively undivided country, be the last bastion of democracy?
>  The world is paying attention to us.
>  On the other hand, Japan is also becoming permeated with a divisive virus. A scene I saw a long time ago in the US. The countdown to division has begun.

LUUP Useful Stories
- The event ends at 7pm and you move to the next venue by 8pm.
- I checked at 7pm and it's a 20 minute bus ride to the station, and if you include the train, you'll just barely make it in time.
- LUUP created room to run 2km in 12 minutes.

The nice thing about LUUP is that you can ride it out.
- I had experience up to "bike + phone holder + GPS."
- But with your own bike, you need a "place to park".
    - Plus, in the old days, it might have been commonplace to park illegally there.
- I'm just speeding up the "from my house to the train station" course, which is not much different from walking.
    - I was not really going to the destination, but rather, I was going to the virtual spots around me in the geo-game and coming back home.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/3e54af2fb02c38382d5766eb9ada1626/thumb/1000)
    - 1: To and from the station
    - 2: Tour of home
    - 3: Go to your destination and ride away
        - New use cases for these 3 have been added.
        - You don't even have to be on the same bike the next time you move from that destination.
        - You will be charged for the duration of the rental, so return it when you get to your destination area to end the contract.
        - No mass-derived ties to "find a place to park your bike" or "ride your bike home."

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946889066320203975) #TeamMirai , 1-2 seats!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1946890873159176391) I want two seats!

> [tanukiponkich](https://x.com/tanukiponkich/status/1946835040278917571) I'm looking at the github report of Team Mirai. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to handle this by myself since there are more than 5,000 PRs, but I can see the horsepower of the group of engineers that Mr. Yasuno has assembled to get the job done.

> [tanukiponkich](https://x.com/tanukiponkich/status/1946835744443834632) This is due to the unexplored projects that METI has invested in over the decades. It was essential to foster a community that included the University of Tokyo and SFC.
