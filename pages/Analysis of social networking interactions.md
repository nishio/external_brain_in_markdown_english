Reusable components extracted from this analysis include
1. framework for analyzing psychological characteristics
    - [Self-analytical perspective: Is the subject aware of [[his/her own issues]] and [[his/her attitude toward those issues]]?
    - [Critical Tendencies: What causes [[criticism]] of others and situations ([[envy]], [[anxiety]], [[value conflicts]]).
        - [[cognitive dissonance]] : [[where the contradiction between action and consciousness]] exists.
2. response types of dialogue participants
    - [[direct advice]]: Whether or not you have specific suggestions to address the issue.
    - Flexibility and [[humor]]: [[attempts to]] ease the air of dialogue.
    - Responding to denials: Continuously attempting to engage in dialogue even when denied.
3. structural analysis frame of exchange
    - [Misalignment of objectives: Whether participants have different perspectives on the outcomes they are seeking or discussing.
    - [Social comparison and anxiety: To what extent is [[comparison with others]] affected during the dialogue?
    - [[Dialogue Parallel]]: To what extent does [[Point of View.]] stall the discussion?
4. psychological factors behind the statements
    - Trust and [[desire for approval]]: signs of craving for approval and connection.
    - Values for information: How do you perceive the "quality" and "quantity" of information?
5. overall dialogue evaluation criteria
    - Influence on the other party: the potential to [[encourage positive change in the other party]].
    - Limitations of the status quo: Factors that limit the impact of the dialogue.

Based on these components, a generic analysis can be performed that can be applied to other social networking interactions.
