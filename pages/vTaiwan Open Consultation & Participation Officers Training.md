Q&A (Audrey Tan)
Now let's go to ...... I was appointed Minister of Digital Affairs ..... .in August 2016.
I waited a month because I am an independent contractor consultant for Apple and therefore have to give 30 days notice.
I don't give private interviews, so journalists can ask me anything they want, but I can only answer them publicly, so we have to put our thoughts on top of each other.
Both the question and the general public have been asked about the idea of a white open such as this.
Multi-stakeholders communicated with the society for several months.
People gradually learned that I was a conservative anarchist in a more radical way. The same sort of thing in Taoism, so ylp do so because it is all voluntary.
Each year we have about 20 full-timers and 30 interns.
But it was also a condition of my entry into government.
And I've learned that they don't pay attention to the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc.
I think because we impose our way of doing things and it is all voluntary, there are no challenges or resistance.
This is because people know that we are a public service - a public servant.
So we provide public services, not the other way around.
I was able to introduce our presence in the central government to those who really wanted it.
We can offer innovative ways to do this without us commanding or forcing you to do so.
I think the number of people who initially participated out of curiosity gradually grew.
Some cases have been quite successful and people have joined not only to reduce risk but also to gain credit. For automation: ...... That's the easy answer: ...... Thank you ...... Other ministers are starting to do this as well.
Yes, we work very closely with the National Development Council.
NDC is essentially a research division, working in two countries, Taiwan and
Once some methods, components, and such are determined, they work quite well.
Since NDCs are employed on a joint platform, there is always a relationship of research and deployment between PDIS.
NDC also coordinates training programs with other firms as well as
For example, a joint platform is not just a petition, but also a local public entity.
It is evolving into a participatory as well as a pre-announcement program of open spending and regulation.
As a result, NDC staff spends a great deal of time with local and regional governments.
It is important to spread this concept of open innovation to national governments.
For this reason, the Office of the President organized this event.
Here is a three-month long presidential election hackathon using more or less the same ideas and methods, and because of that
The President's Office has access to far more data than we do, and can function in all Presidential Offices.
The five winners of this annual presidential hackathon come from different branches of government.
There is no monetary reward. There are very nice trophies, but no monetary rewards.
Five innovative ideas will be part of our public service offerings starting next year.
Innovation is also employed on the scale of the presidential office.
It's something that is prototyped, studied, failed over and over, and made public, but if you settle on something that really works
And it propagates upwards and downwards: ...... It's unbelievable.
So, I'm sorry, but I'm going to say what I understand, just to clarify if I understood.
So, to all of you who are experts in digital services, please correct me if I have been and am wrong.
But you have a specific methodology and you tell the government that you want to work with me under my methodology.
It is voluntary, but legally has no binding force or authority over any other person.
Yes, there is no digital ministry.
Each participating officer will report to the CIO.
The ministries and we are merely facilitators of the PIO network.
That is why there are about 30 ministries with participating office teams, and that is the rule.
It is their regulations that created this network, but my position within it is the same.
As a facilitator, you cannot force participating officers to do anything.
Also, do you ever work with agencies that may have confidential information or things you can't do?
In that case, due to the nature of the information they do not come to us or with us.
Because it is voluntary.
What percentage of these 30 ministries?
It's like that.
What is the percentage of CIOs that are allies or not particularly so?
He is enthusiastic about the project as a
So dangerous, in fact, that half of the ministries
Work very closely with voters and protesters and
This is a method that is gradually gaining attention as a way to take advantage of
New power, horizontal power, to channel them, new power, horizontal power, to channel them.
However, that is not the case.
It is a ministry that targets citizens and has personnel authority.
Exercise and Problems ...... It took me a year to meet with public officials.
They are also potential constituents.
They will also fight for their own well-being in such cases, and in such cases they will fight for their own well-being.
Getting them involved early in the participatory process makes a lot of sense.
is more citizen-like, such as the Agricultural Council.
And the second wave is for positions closer to civil servants, and of course there are still some ministries that do so.
We are primarily responsible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is one of the ministries we serve.
It works closely for things like public relations and not for other things.
However, this methodology has not yet been used to translate citizen input into trade.
I feel that there is a third wave of service contract negotiations, etc.
Traditionally, they do not engage with Taiwanese citizens at all. ...... Their main constituents are abroad and around.
There are other ways to do it, but even so, there is no such thing as resistance.
Therefore, I think that makes the response more natural.
How much do you want to face the citizens and how much do you want to adopt their methods?
Hi, do you have any financial requirements set for other agencies?
are they paid or are they paid by other agencies, which is a very 18f question.
Is it a fee for service or do we need to bill other agencies or is it voluntary?
The billing model is how we as a government agency recover our costs.
In short, we are looking for talent, not budgets.
In this method, you will be asked to organize your team according to the skill criteria we have come up with.
You must pay for the expertise and skills required for that particular case.
to meet not only HR's requirements but also the requirements of the service itself.
There is very little required as it is only free software and appreciation software.
Operationally, with the right people in the right places, ..... .GV Zero is very thrifty.
The innovative way is that we always know how to use the software in its
It can be accomplished at zero cost and in two ways.
To combat takeover by private vendors: ...... We always find open source.
If it starts to become proprietary, as in POLIS, then peer pressure will convince it to go open source.
So it is one way to move forward without incurring licensing fees or other financial burdens.
Any other questions? I don't want to be exclusive: ...... Yes. ...... What is your wish?
Of all the participants you have opened up to, who has come close to you and who has not?
Also, what do you hope to communicate to those who have not been involved in the project?
Yes, ...... This is one of the evolutionary points in Taiwan's history.
Because of this, we started to deal only with digital issues, but for certain types of issues, we started to deal only with digital issues.
There were calls for a special chapter in the Corporate Law on profit corporations and social enterprises.
The results showed that stakeholders, in the main, may be using the Internet, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
And even if you follow the live stream, it will not be translated.
Therefore, instead of bringing such people, we make it participatory, where they can act.
To this end, we held fifteen meetings.
We will travel around Taiwan and go to places where the indigenous people seem to live and in the countryside.
They are socially entrepreneurial and my crew and I are listening to them.
But you can use live streams and other things to keep track of what is happening at the town hall.
The people of Taipei must respond to inquiries from 12 different ministries via videoconference.
real time, as if in Taiwan, but using video conferencing.
This was done to improve an unnecessary process.
In addition, their preferred mode of behavior is not a written or yes/no questionnaire.
Adapt the entire process based on the components
equal temperament (music)
Yes, what is the name of the annual hackathon? It is the Presidential Hackathon.
presidential thank-you
It may not be appropriate to ask this question, but I am just trying to get a comparative idea of how others are doing.
Structuring digital innovation by governments at the city or national level
And ...... I don't know if you have ever done any comparative thinking.
We will discuss how these initiatives are emerging around the world and what the advantages and disadvantages of V TAIWAN are.
Experiences in this context
Regarding this question, yes, Taiwan.
Geographically and historically, Taiwan is very unique.
This is because of its population of 23 million people and high Internet penetration.
Measured by NDC, it was over 80%.
It is very important that our President commit to broadband that respects human rights.
Many countries have declared it, but very few have actually realized it.
In areas without broadband access or in rural areas.
It is not the government's fault, it is a simple right.
Of the 23 million, about 5 million use e-petitions and other websites.
Therefore, as the digital gap and digital technology advances, this problem may arise.
It is like a digital divide (information gap).
Assume that some people do not have access to broadband and that there is a problem with access.
If not, then it would be very different. It is at the city level or comparable to the city.
The philosophy at the city and national level in Estonia, then, is really a big span.
Digital services at the national level need to accommodate heterogeneous digital connections.
These two are that the pressure for open government actually comes from Japan.
Civil society is quite different from other especially Asian countries.
This is because Taiwan only lifted martial law and prohibition 30 years ago.
We look at PRC today to see what Taiwan was like 30 years ago.
This is a call from civil society.
The armed groups will not want to go back there, so remember that there is absolute freedom of speech and assembly.
etc., can be seen as a kind of exegesis on the generation.
In my generation and younger generations we are considered conservative.
units and demand for more.
Civil society has always demanded radical transparency and participation, but this is not the case in other Asian countries.
Country ...... That is another difference.
