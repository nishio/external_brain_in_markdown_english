title: "Predicting the Future and Apple Trees"

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1842929783027736914) We talked about how [[future prediction]] can be done by considering "[[apple tree]]" as a model...
>  "At any given moment, which apple will fall from the tree?" is unpredictable.
>  but
>  "By winter, most of the apples will be falling off the tree" is predictable.
>  Discard the former forecasting problem and focus on the latter.
> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1842930107058630817) People who miss a lot of predictions or are unevenly distributed focus on the former prediction problem.
> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1842930601164464491) The former is expensive, has a low strike rate, cannot be deployed laterally, and is easily wasted.
>  Life is advantageous enough if you just stick firmly to the latter question.
