title: 'People who do not understand "the act of creating new value."'

They do not know how it feels to have their originality damaged, so they do not feel remorse when they plagiarize.

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1755726341717237886) For the past few years, I have been uncomfortable with the fact that there are so many people who consume value only to take away the achievements of others or to satisfy their own greed, and I have been asking myself why I cannot understand "[[the increase in total value]]," which is the true essence of manufacturing. I have been asking myself why they don't understand "[[increase in total value]]," which is the essence of monozukuri, and it finally became clear to me. They don't believe in "[[the act of creating new value]] itself in the first place."

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1755727586456707404) If you have come to believe that everything and everyone else's possessions are "a combination of [[something that came from somewhere]] and [[something that already existed in the world]]," then it doesn't matter whether you steal them or use them without permission. If you believe that everything you have is "a combination of [[things that came from somewhere]] and [[things that already existed in the world]]," then it doesn't matter if you steal them or use them without permission, you simply recognize that you have "acquired usable parts. This unique cognitive bias must be at the root of the problem. That is how I understood it.

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1755729019432210462) Originality is relatively easy to achieve if one makes the effort, and new value can be created if one puts in the effort. They have not yet acquired the fact that this is a fundamental activity for humans." Excessive trust in the world" blinds people to their uniqueness and the effort behind it.

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1755730940503159019) Over the past decade or so, I have witnessed in many situations a kind of "creativity sickness" where people "can't create without materials. This trend seems to be accelerating. To think that we have created something just by putting things together, almost like an assemblage, is nothing but an act of ignoring the efforts of our predecessors who have built our civilization from generation to generation.

> [knshtyk](https://twitter.com/knshtyk/status/1755733818181558371) Materials are a medium for skill acquisition to learn [[chewing]] and understand and extract methods in one's own way, not parts to copy and paste. I have read too many people who assume that everything already exists in the world through information, and I have read them that way. Just reassembling the puzzle doesn't create a new picture.
