Plurality.net is an open and collaborative book project led by Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tang and intellectual leader E. Glen Weyl. It aims to redefine the relationship between democracy and technology through a pluralistic, Web3 enabled vision of collaborative governance.

The main goals are as follows

1. elucidate and disseminate successful models of digital democracy
2. advocating the use of digital tools to increase participation in democracy and counter authoritarianism
3. reinventing publishing through the use of regenerative web3 tools
4. to get more people from around the world to participate in large-scale experiments using these tools
5. establishing Audrey Tang as an international symbol of pluralism and regenerative web3

In the short term, we aim to promote a global debate on digital democracy and encourage the adoption of democratic innovations. In the long term, it aims to establish pluralism as the future paradigm for technology and politics by 2030 and to make Taiwan a global symbol of digital democracy.

Funds will be used to cover the cost of publishing this important book together and making it available in bookstores. plurality.net aims to ensure a future that empowers decentralized, rather than centrally controlled, democracy to thrive in the digital age.
