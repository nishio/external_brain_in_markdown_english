title: "Intelligence, not knowledge, is trusted as the environment changes faster."

from [[Kozaneba:Plurality]]
Intelligence, not knowledge, is trusted as the environment changes faster.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645698957685960704) When the environment changes slowly, the stock of knowledge that has been refined by the eyes and hands of many is superior to any one individual and is the object of trust. However, when the environment changes quickly, that stock is no longer appropriate for the current situation. At such times, it is not the "[[knowledge]]" but the "[[intelligence]]" that produces it that is trusted.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1645699908199129092) I'm going back and looking into a concept I don't understand, and I'm coming back to Audrey Tan, and I'm thinking, "[[Audrey Tan]] isn't stupid, and she has no incentive to trick me. There's no incentive to fool me, so I guess I can trust him." and meta-me observed me thinking that.
