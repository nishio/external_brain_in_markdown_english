title: "Avoid overlapping stickies."

from [[pRegroup2020]]
- Avoid overlapping stickies.
    - The test user says, "I moved the sticky and it came up again from below!" They're confused.
    - Stickies should be made so they don't overlap.
    - Adding a sticky when adding one is always in the center
        - More and more things are piling up on top of each other.
        - Every time you add something, you can shift it sideways and fold it back when it comes to the edge of the screen.
            - Just reset it to center every time you open AddPane.
        - →done
    - When added in batches
        - I used to place them randomly, but that just gets confusing, so I started arranging them in squares.
- If there is already a sticky note in the position where you are going to write, avoid it.
    - HitTest from the four corners, and if it hits, go to the next candidate location.
