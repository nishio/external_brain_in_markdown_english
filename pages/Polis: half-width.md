> [@dz_](https://twitter.com/dz_/status/1655396949758197761): Half-width spaces between Japanese and English words? No?
> This is a sample. This is sample.
> I used to be in the camp of putting it in because I thought it would make it easier to see, but I started to feel it was superfluous and have been experimenting with not putting it in lately.
> Which is it for you guys? I'd love to hear your reasons in a rip~üôå

> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1655458177255882754?s=20): I guess if you use a proportional Japanese font with a modern GUI, it will put the proper amount of white space (quarter space) on its own.
> I'm not sure how to put "half-width" spaces in a monospace font, which is a dirty font....

> [@felis_silv](https://twitter.com/felis_silv/status/1655460699462840320?s=20): @kazuho I'm of the opinion that sometimes it's better to put spaces in the text to make it wrap better. Especially for western apps that don't support CJK well. If you put two or more English words in the middle of a sentence, it will wrap badly.

> [@XR230](https://twitter.com/XR230/status/1655465766987386881?s=20): @kazuho If you consider your manuscript for publication, please don't do half-width aki, because DTP apps like InDesign will automatically do it, DTP apps such as InDesign will automatically add the "aki".

> [@babie](https://twitter.com/babie/status/1655457200591228928?s=20): @dz_ I don't remember when, but iOS, iPadOS, and macOS automatically adjust to show spaces as if they are there even if they are not. I thought it was the job of the rendering side, so I stopped adding spaces.

> [@hebikuzure](https://twitter.com/hebikuzure/status/1655418760470339584?s=20): @dz_ Microsoft's style guide is "put half-width characters", so it became ingrained in me when I worked for MS. I was so ingrained when I was working for MS.

> [@kaorun](https://twitter.com/kaorun/status/1655465128752726017?s=20): @dz_ The Japanese version of Word has a Japanese-European interspace function, so you don't have to put it in yourself, and documents created in Word automatically have the appropriate You don't have to put the space between Japanese and European texts by yourself.
> By the way, you can also turn it Off in the paragraph formatting/style.

> [@tkihira](https://twitter.com/tkihira/status/1655533377666285568?s=20): As a web engineer, I think it is right that these things are controlled by CSS and so on, and it is not right to put spaces I think it's not right to put spaces in the text, but I do it. I use spaces to stimulate my brain when I am typing (seriously). I started inserting spaces relatively recently.

> [@kuboon](https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1655539858549665800?s=20): if it's English text, you put a space between words, so isn't one principle valid to put a space to separate English-Japanese text? I'm not sure.

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1655544727360671745?s=20): @kuboon "renders the same with or without whitespace" is correct.
