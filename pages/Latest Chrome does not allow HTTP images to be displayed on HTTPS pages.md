Latest Chrome does not allow HTTP images to be displayed on HTTPS pages
- I get these errors.
    - `Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure element 'http://...'. This request was automatically upgraded to HTTPS, For more information see` [https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/no-more-mixed-messages-about-https.html](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/no-more-mixed-messages-about-https.html)
- From Chrome M86
- I was investigating the Regroup [✅Image stickies are not showing up in the latest Chrome.
- This is not a problem limited to Regroup.
    - For example, Scrapbox is also an HTTPS service, so the part that was loading images over HTTP is broken.
