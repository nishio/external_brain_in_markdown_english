<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The two growth rates indicated by Piketty are "[[economic growth rate]] (g)" and "[[return-on-investment ratio]] (r)." The economic growth rate (g) indicates the increase in national income, while the return-on-investment ratio (r) indicates the percentage of income derived from capital (assets). Piketty noted that when "r > g," wealth inequality increases.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the specific value?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The specific values that Piketty presents in Capital in the 21st Century are as follows:
- Economic growth (g): 1-2%.
- Return on capital (r): 4-5%.
This leads to a situation in which the rate of return on capital outpaces the rate of economic growth, and those with assets accumulate wealth at a faster pace, leading to widening inequality.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> For [[venture capital]] (VC) investment returns, 2023 data show that the 10-year [[internal rate of return]] (IRR) averaged around 13%, but grew by only 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was the first positive growth rate since 2021.
