<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The expression "axis blurring" originally referred to a blurring of the physical axis, or unsteadiness, but in the context of business and project management, it refers to an instability in goals, policies, or standards that have not been established.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Physical axis blurring means that when an object rotates, its axis of rotation becomes unstable and shakes or changes position. For example, when a motor, wheel, fan, etc. rotates, ideally it should rotate smoothly around a fixed axis, but if the axis is blurred, the rotation may become unstable, causing vibration and noise. This is often caused by worn bearings, imprecision in assembly, or structural weaknesses. Physical shaft blurring conditions can adversely affect the performance and durability of the machine, ultimately causing it to fail.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the context of project management, "axing" refers to the instability of a project's goals and policies and deviation from the initial plan and the results to be aimed for. This can lead to a lack of project focus and frequent changes in direction, which can result in wasted resources, delays in progress, confusion and lack of motivation within the team. In short, the "off-axis" condition can be viewed as a problem that can negatively impact the quality and delivery of project deliverables and complicate the path to success.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> Unclear goals / Poor planning / Poor communication / Lack of flexibility / Delayed or unclear decision making / [[Scope creep]]
- >  Scope Creep
- >  The scope of the project gradually becomes unclear and expands out of control, making it easier to deviate from the original goals.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think it is too naive to think that if the goals and plans are clear in advance, the problem can be solved. In many cases, new discoveries are made as the project progresses. Ignoring these discoveries and carrying out the initial plan is not "shaky," but it is bad [[rigid]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The [[agile]] project management approach has been widely adopted to address this situation. Agile emphasizes flexibility in planning and execution, evaluating progress through regular feedback loops and adjusting direction as needed.
