title: "person who disturbs (e.g. someone's peace)"
---

- The concept of a "person who disturbs harmony."
    - When there is a problem in [[Team Management]], the cause is not a specific individual, but the whole team.
- Labeling and ostracizing a particular individual as a "peacemaker" may seem to solve the problem in the short term, but it only distracts from the true nature of the problem, and is an action that will lead away from a solution in the long term.
