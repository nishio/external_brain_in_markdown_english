title: "throughout"
---

To say it's messy and "all over the place" is misleading.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
Not that any point satisfies the condition of being an irrational number, but it is an irrational number with [[probability 1]], a kind of story.

The statement "any point is an irrational number" is actually incorrect because it means "all points satisfy that property." In fact, you want to say that "almost every point (in a metric sense) is an irrational number" because "the set of points that are irrational numbers" in a bounded interval, for example, occupies [[measurement]] 1 (i.e., the measure of a rational number in a bounded interval is 0). Mathematically, it is more appropriate to say "almost everywhere (almost everywhere) is irrational" or "is irrational in measure 1".

On the other hand, "everywhere (measure-theoretically everywhere) is irrational" is literally interpreted as "all points are irrational" and does not fit the situation where "not every point satisfies the condition (of being an irrational number), but with probability 1 (measure-1)". The phrase "almost everywhere (measure-theoretically almost everywhere)" correctly expresses the nuance of "throughout the entire region except for an exceptional set (measure 0).

Dense" is a topological concept that means "any point in any neighborhood of a point contains a point that satisfies the condition. For example, the entire rational numbers are tight-lattice in the entire real numbers, but the measure of the rational numbers is 0. On the other hand, "probability 1" or "measure 1" is a metric concept, which means that "a set occupies 1 of the measures (probabilities) of the whole (the measure of the exceptional set is 0)".

Therefore,
- Tightness: Whether or not an element is always in the neighborhood (any small open interval)
- Measure 1 (probability 1): whether the set occupies almost all (the exception is measure 0) in the measure
Thus, whether or not it is tight-lattice and whether or not it has a measurement of 1 are concepts on completely different axes.
- Example: Rational number is "tight-lattice" but has "measure 0
- Example: The irrational numbers are "tight-lattice" but "measure 1

The word "everywhere" tends to literally mean "every point itself satisfies the condition", but "almost everywhere" means almost everywhere with the exception of measure 0, so it is a different concept from tightness. It is necessary to distinguish between topological "neighborhood entry (tightness)" and metric "size of the exception set (measure 1, 0)".
