- Distribution sampling the variance of the normal distribution from the half Cauchy distribution
    - Suppose this is the distribution of weights
    - Very wide base due to [[Cauchy distribution]] effect = robust
    - The Cauchy distribution is a very wide distribution with no definable mean or variance
- But the origin spike is high.
    - Is it greater than zero?
        - No, so it does not collapse to just 0.
