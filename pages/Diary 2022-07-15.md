- [[Project Hail Mary]]
- My wife said, "Read it because a number of people who read it said, 'I can't tell you anything about the details, but it was interesting, so read it,'" so I did, and I'm on chapter 3, and I can't tell you anything about it, but it's interesting.
- I now know what the term "Hail Mary" means.
- If you google it, the mystery in the beginning will be spoiled, so please squint and buy it without looking at the synopsis (see below).

- [[It's not "more of the same."]]
