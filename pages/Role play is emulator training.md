title: "Role play is emulator training"

roleplay (e.g. in computer RPG games)
- (Digital [[RPGs]] don't offer much freedom for role-playing, so I think of [[table talk RPGs]], or in 2025, [[Murder Mysteries]] or [[LARPs]].

This is literally [[playing a role]].

I think this is an [[emulator]] exercise.

- Emulate the thoughts of people who are different from you.
    - It allows for a physical understanding of different thinking people.
    - [Relative to thought.
