- Project note on [[Tools to organize your head]] ([[Regroup]])

- [[Network of demand requests]] needed to be created.
- That should have been a higher priority than managing task status in Scrapbox.


- [[Regroup Release Notes 5/11/2021]]

- Cover Undo with a test
    - Currently, it probably doesn't work at all.
- Use it to organize your Twitter replies.
    - Replies (unlike my usual writing) are in a "japanese" style, which eats up the number of characters.
- IME on for import and forget to turn it off and the cursor gets stuck?
    - Can't it be turned off when the dialog is closed?
- Clear content when import is closed

    - [[I would like to discuss the design of Regroup]]
        - [[Stop ðŸ¤” parallel shift mode]]
    - [[More language about what happens after exporting from Keicho to Regroup would be nice.]]
    - Need to get a message from the guide during the tutorial.
    - Tutorials should limit what you can do.

    - [[ðŸ¤”Make 3 explanations of how to use Regroup in specific applications.]]
    - [[ðŸ¤”I need to know how many stickies there are now.]]
    - [[ðŸ¤”Import screen, should there be a button for easy editing on iPad?]]
    - [[Generate Regroup map from ðŸ¤”multiline text]]

    - [[âœ…Image stickies are not showing up in the latest Chrome.]]
    - [[âœ…Error dialog appears when creating a new blank map]]
    - [[I changed the âœ…favicon.]]
    - [[âœ…Multi-line import dialog with sticky click]]
- Keicho  [[Generate Regroup map from âœ… chat logs]]
    - [[âœ…Number and length of stickies to be added on the import screen.]]
        - [[Only one of the divs lined up in âœ…flexbox is scroll]]
        - [[Jump to the beginning of the âœ… longest line]]
    - [[âœ…Easily share the work process with readers]]
    - [[Assistance in dividing long sentences into stickies]]
    - Import screen, I'd like to be able to paste a long sentence and with one click, chop it up appropriately.
    - â†’ [[âœ… longest line is ticked with one click]]
- âœ…Cursor movement direction, reversed
    - [[âœ… Parallel movement with WASD or cursor]]
        - [[I would like to discuss the design of Regroup]]
    - [[âœ…Toggle between overall zoom and full-size view with the space key]]
    - [[âœ…Bug in which the whole view shortcut does not show the whole view.]]

    - [[ðŸ¤”Make a screenshot in full size]] feature would be nice
    - [[Icons on external link stickies are misaligned when stickies are enlarged.]]
- Selection highlight is thin and difficult to see when zoomed out and selected
- I created a function for titled stickies, but [[server side rendering]] is required to "show the title when pasting an external site", which was my initial expectation.
    - If you are going to make a SSR, it would be better to make a thumbnail at the "Create a link for sharing" stage.
    - 3/29/2021 Once commented out of the menu
- The ability to zoom out to the overall view would be nice.
    - If you don't specify the viewport in the URL, that's what you're doing, so if you can activate that, that's all you need to do.
- Is it easier to find and move newly added stickies (one or more) if I keep them selected?
- Paste maintains the original coordinates, so it may appear off-screen.
    - Should I zoom out as far as I can see?
- In lasso mode, sometimes the selected highlight does not appear even though it is enclosed. If I try to move it in that state, of course it doesn't work. Unlocking the lasso doesn't work either.
    - It is not yet clear if this happens outside of finger manipulation on the iPad.
- No ghosting indicator when lassoing, making it difficult to move multiple pieces and place them in a good spot on an existing sticky.
    - However, ghosting displays would make multiple moves less smooth.
    - For example, only the border line can be produced, or only when the number of sheets is small, etc...
- Undo of lasso selection move not heard?

- [[REGROUP-10]]
- When selecting stickies in lasso mode on iPad and x2, gray selection highlighting winds up occurring for empty groups.
    - Not reproduced.
    - [[Export in JSON format]] Low priority
    - Select and copy will go into the clipboard.
    - Want to export as a file?
    - In that case, you'd want to import it as a file.

    - [[Image links can also be OpenURL]]
    - [[Larger sticky size causes text to shift.]]
