Just as the fully qualified class name java.lang.String is guaranteed to be unique in Java, and just as the name String is used unqualified in Java, so too in natural languages, when a class name is sufficiently qualified to have no semantic blur (e.g. "[[artifact]] in [[Engelbert's Four Classifications]]"), as is the case with the name "String", which is guaranteed to be uniquely qualified and unqualified on the one hand, and on the other hand used as an artifact.

In programming languages, explicit importing uniquely defines how names are resolved in scope, but in natural languages, there is no explicit importing, so implicit importing varies from person to person
