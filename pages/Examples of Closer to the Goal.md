title: "Examples of Closer to the Goal"

- The completion of the [[Project for English-language intellectual production techniques for engineers (-20200122)]] was "will it be finished by the end of March or will it be delayed until April?" The situation was "will it be finished in March or delayed until April?
This is too far from the goal.
So I tried to display the estimated number of days remaining per chapter (far right)
The estimated number of days remaining in Chapter 1 is 1.5.
This estimated number of days remaining is calculated by dividing the number of pages remaining by the average amount of progress per day (column name is "pages/day").
Average amount of progress divided by the "number of days since the start of the project, including days not done.
So, "If I work hard today, I'll make above-average progress, so if it's 1.5, I can make it, right?" And so it becomes, "If I work hard today, I can make above-average progress.
