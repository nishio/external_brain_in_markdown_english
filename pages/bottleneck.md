> Bottleneck ([[bottleneck]]) is a concept of constraint in system design. English meaning "neck of a bottle."... [[rate-determining]] (risuku)... [[bottleneck]] (airo), a synonym also exists... An allusion to the fact that no matter how large the size of the bottle, the volume and rate of outflow ([[throughput]]) of the contents is constrained only by the narrowed neck.

- [[Flow Rate Metaphor]]

Local optimization of non-bottleneck areas does not improve overall throughput ([[local optimum]] is not [[global optimization]]).
