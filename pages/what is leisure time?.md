title: "what is leisure time?"
---

When I tried to explain the concept of "(of one's business) slow" in "[[waste of time]]" in English, I found positive nuance in [[free]] and [[leisure]]. Leisure in Japanese has a negative nuance.

Busy" is "killing time", but time is not "boredom".

Core image of "Leisure

- A state of being "idle" with no external obligations or internal objects of devotion.
- It is not "leisure" that is "reserved" for enrichment and rest, but includes the feeling of emptiness and boredom** that comes with **excess time.
- It is often said that a prolonged "negative void" can lead to mental harm ([[waste of time]]) such as lethargy, jealousy, and negative thinking.

Points to consider when translating into English
- (1) Just doing nothing
    - idleness / idle time
    - Negative connotations of "idle" and "idle" | Closest to "idle" is the feeling of "engine idling" | Negative connotations of "idle" and "idle" are the feeling of "engine idling
- (2) Emphasize harm
    - the perils (or harms) of idleness
    - waste of time
    - "Perils" with alarming wording.
- (3) Boredom is a constant time
    - dead time / empty time
    - Zero productivity, time is "dead" colloquially
- 4) Leisure time
    - kill time / time-killing activities
    - Act of "killing" time
    - Note that "time" is the object.

> *Proposed translation**
>
>  * leisure time harms → *"the harms of idleness "* or *"idleness hazards "*
>  *an idle person* → *an idle person* (*"free" and "at leisure" are too positive)

### Difference from "leisure / free time

- The etymology of **leisure** *scholē* (ancient Greek) includes the **positive value** of "learning and thinking in leisure time," and even modern English takes on the nuances of rest and self-improvement.
- **free time** also neutral to positive.
    - Thus, in "leisure time" = "free time," the negative connotations (idleness, boredom, emptiness) fall away.

### Cultural Background Memo

- In Japanese society, the context of "busy = virtue" is deeply rooted, and "busybody" tends to be a mildly derogatory term.
    - Ah, this is the influence of Japanese culture.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Psychological research has also reported that subjective well-being declines** when free time exceeds 5 hours per day, and excessive "free time" can lead to stress and low self-esteem.
