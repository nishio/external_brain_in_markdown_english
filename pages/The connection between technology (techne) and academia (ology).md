The phrase demonstrates the connection between [[technology]] (techne) and [[discipline]] (ology). Specifically, it focuses on creating methodologies that produce results more efficiently than random trial and error.

explanation
- Techne (Technology):.
    - The ancient Greek word means "skill" or "technique.
    - In modern times, it refers to practical knowledge and skills to achieve specific goals.
        - [[technetium (Teknay)]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Ology: Ology
    - Suffix meaning "˜study' or '˜theory'.
    - Indicates a systematic field of knowledge or research.

Significance of the combination
- This phrase means creating a systematic methodology to increase efficiency. In other words, we aim to find more effective techniques and solutions by using a planned and scientific approach rather than random trial and error.

concrete example
- For example, in the evolution of agricultural technology, the following methodologies may be considered
    - Random crop crosses: creating new crop varieties through trial and error.
    - Scientific breeding techniques: using knowledge of genetics to efficiently breed crops with the right characteristics for the right purpose.

The latter methodology combines techne and ology to produce more efficient and effective results. Thus, the combination of technology and systematic study can optimize the evolutionary and generative processes.
