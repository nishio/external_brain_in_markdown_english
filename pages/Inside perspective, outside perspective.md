[[Inside view]], [[Outside view]].
Inside and outside of organizations, communities, and linguistic spheres.

Send inward
- [[inaudible]].
        - [[incorrect cycle]]
        - Only in a community setting do we share our accomplishments and praise each other to build affirmation.
- I don't send it out.
    - Nothing from the outside
        - non-existence

If you want to be a being, you have to be at least [[observable]].
- Put it in a public forum or have it automatically translated into English.
- But just making it observable is not enough at all.
    - [[information overload]]
    - [[Content Excessive]]
        - [[congestion]]
        - [[tax congestion and subsidize public goods]].
    - [[attention]] is expensive
- We need [[contextual connections]] for our existence to be recognized by others.
        - [[context]] [[connection]]

Scrapbox-like patterns of thinking
- Layers that represent things not by the content itself but by its connections
    - [[Expression by connection]]
            - [[connection]]
- Our existence is defined not merely by self, but also by [[our relationships with others]], our connections.
        - [[intersubjectivity]]
        - [[Expression of connection, not community affiliation]]
- Connections make our existence understandable and recognizable to others.

Concepts such as organizations, communities, or linguistic areas are often divided into "inside" and "outside" perspectives. This inside-outside perspective can lead to important problems in information dissemination.

First, consider transmitting from the "inside". This is often referred to as "uchi-uke," and is characterized by the sharing of accomplishments only within the community and mutual admiration and affirmation. However, the resulting spoiled cycle is "non-existent," invisible to the outside world. As a result, in order to be present, it must be at least observable.

Being observable includes putting one's thoughts in a public forum and utilizing automatic English translation. However, being observable is not enough. Today's society is in a state of information overload and content overload. As congestion increases, our "attention" becomes more and more expensive as we tax what is congested and subsidize public goods.

The key here is "contextual connection". For our presence to be recognized by others, we need to connect our thoughts and actions in a context that others can understand. This is a reference to the Scrapbox-like pattern of thinking, meaning that we represent things by their connections, not by the content itself.

Our existence is defined not only by our self, but also by our relationships and connections with others. This is called intersubjectivity. And this connection allows us to express ourselves not through community affiliation, but through our relationships with others. In other words, the connection makes our existence understandable and recognizable to others.

Through the above discussion, we hope that we can offer new perspectives to help us connect with society.

Perspectives from within and without: what is our existence?
How is our presence observed and perceived? The answer to this question depends largely on whether we view it from an inner or outer perspective.

First, when we look within our self, we feel that our existence is firmly established. Our actions and thoughts are shaped by our perception of self, which reflects what we perceive as self. This perspective can easily become an insider's view. This is because this perspective is often limited to how we represent and understand the self.
- Oh, that's how you interpret it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I was imagining talking about the ins and outs of organizations and communities.

However, when looking at us from the outside, our presence may be little or not visible at all. In this case we become non-existent. Making ourselves observable to others is the minimum requirement for recognizing ourselves as existing.

However, it is not enough to simply be observable. In today's society we are faced with information overload. Content is in excess and we need contextual connections for our presence to be recognized by others.

This is much like the Scrapbox pattern of thinking. In this pattern, things are represented not by the individual contents themselves, but by the way they are connected. In other words, our existence is defined not simply by self, but also by our relationships and connections with others.

This connection is the key to making our presence understandable and recognizable to others.
