In the first BMOT special class, "Intellectual Production," it is stated that the nature of intellectual production depends on whether or not one is aware of a problem. Without a sense of the problem, it is possible to get the job done by simply tracing the methods given to you. Even if the same work is given to you, it is important to devise ways to use that time to invest in yourself and to expand and reproduce.

It is important to keep the fun alive.
