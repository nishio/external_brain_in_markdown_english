title: "Group formation based on familial similarity"

> When you find one that seems to be related, move it so that the two warps are close to each other. By repeating this process, a group of warp lines that seem to be related to each other will gradually form.
- [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]  p.152  [[(5.2.3) Move the possibly related items closer together]]


This is [[grouping]] based on [[familial resemblance]].
- What is the difference between [Classification.
- Classification is done by first determining "characteristics common to the group" and then deciding whether a person is a member of the group or not based on the presence or absence of those characteristics.
- On the other hand, a group formation based on [[familial resemblance]] only requires a relationship among its members, without any common characteristics.

It seems we need advice to release the captivity of "we must create a group with common characteristics."
