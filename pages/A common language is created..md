- 1: Alice has something she wants to express in a blur, but doesn't know just the right word for it.
    - It may be that Alice simply doesn't know, or there may not yet be a corresponding word in the world to begin with.
- 2: I dare say that Alice could be expressed by a combination of existing words A and B.
    - For example, "[[Properly subjective]]", "[[intersubjective]]", "[[dwell-think]]", "[[Institutionalized language]]", etc.
- 3: Bob hears that combination of A and B and thinks, I don't understand; I don't feel like A and B are well connected.
- 4: Bob thinks for a while and says, "Well, if I think about it from this angle, perspective, and point of view, there is a relationship between A and B. This must be what Alice wanted to say! I'm sure that's what Alice meant!
    - At this point Bob thinks, "I get it!" but of course it is an untested hypothesis whether this "interpretation" FB is consistent with what Alice "wanted to tell" F
    - This "I get it!" is still fuzzy in Bob's brain, so he can't tell Alice to verify it.

- 5: Bob tries to put this "I get it!" and thinks, "In essence, the relationship between A and B is the relationship between C and D."
    - Here, "what we know" that had not yet been verbalized is being verbalized.
- 6: And when I told that to Alice, she said, "What? That's totally different. or something like that.

Through this kind of exchange, a common symbolic space is created for the two of them.

- Each of us sees things differently from the perspective we originally had, but we arrive at a structure that allows us to do so without contradiction.

This "exchange" is a common experience and [[collaboration]] in the SECI model.
Through this process, [[lingua franca]] is born for Alice and Bob.
- If someone hasn't gone through that process, I think, let's try to express it in a way that they can understand it.
- This adds constraints and costs to communication.

        - [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]] without using the terminology.
    - The term "[[symbolic space]]" doesn't have much of an explanation written on it yet, like the A+B that just came out of Alice.
    - [[6 and 9]] or [[It's not a circle or a square.]]
