title: "Taskshoot Experience"

>  What I found when I tried [[task shoot]] was that a document task that I estimated to take "10 minutes" took 14 and 17 minutes respectively, a reply to an e-mail that I thought "3 minutes is enough" took 7 minutes, and every time I went to the restroom, which I thought took 0 minutes, 3 minutes were consumed. Or you may think it takes zero minutes, but every time you go to the restroom, you spend 3 minutes.
> On days when I had a lot of emails and documents, I thought I was losing time very quickly and not getting any work done at all, but that was because [[estimate]] was off on the low side.
