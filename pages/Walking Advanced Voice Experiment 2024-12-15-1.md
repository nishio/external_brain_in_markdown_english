Instead of the traditional "by project" classification, the need for flexible management of ideas and tasks by action units and link structures, and the reduction of cognitive load through GTD-like overall understanding and "invisibility" were pointed out. Practical issues related to the communication environment and inter-tool collaboration (Scrapbox, O1 Pro, etc.) were also touched upon, and the importance of an efficient information organization strategy based on the division of roles between humans and AI was summarized.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>In this dialogue, the participants discussed many aspects, ranging from how to collect and manage conversations via voice input while on the move to the fundamental issues of information organization and task management.
1. voice input and communication instability while walking:
    - Communication in outdoor environments, such as headsets and Zoom connections, revealed UDP-based communication instability.
    - Even in a 5G environment, interruptions occur, causing a sense of "interruption" in the conversation.
    - The transmission of information on the move inevitably involves the influence of communication conditions, requiring exchanges in places where communication is stable and temporary stops are necessary.
2. basic information organization tasks: use of GTD and Scrapbox:
    - The importance of using GTD to externalize information in the mind and reduce cognitive load was reaffirmed. In addition, tools such as Scrapbox allow for flexible linking of interrelated information rather than fixed "project" units.
3. the problem of "project-specific" classification and alternative approaches:
    - Project-based classification is difficult to handle ideas and tasks that span multiple domains. Instead, organizing them in a flexible framework, such as actionable action-based or objective, priority, and linkage structure, can reduce confusion.
4. cognitive load and "[[invisibility]]" of task management:
    - Huge task lists exceed human short-term memory limits and create anxiety and stress.
    - As a countermeasure, it is easier to stay focused if necessary tasks are carefully selected and displayed and other tasks are made "invisible".
    - The same idea applies to methods such as [[managing incomplete chats in tabs]].
5. division of roles between humans and AI:
    - Humans are not good at handling large amounts of information at once, but AI can process vast amounts of information and extract relevance.
    - Hybrid operations, in which AI maintains the overall picture and humans focus only on the essentials, are effective in reducing cognitive load and improving efficiency.
6. inter-tool collaboration and data migration issues:
    - A mechanism is needed to utilize data between different tools, such as passing information from Scrapbox to O1 Pro.
    - Efficient collaboration should be sought through exports, APIs, cloud sharing, etc.
7. practical innovations in task management:
    - Specific techniques were presented, including limiting the number of short-term priority tasks, reviewing tasks through weekly reviews, organizing unnecessary tasks, and utilizing "Someday/Maybe" lists. If these are made a habit, long-term stability and stress reduction can be expected.

Comprehensive Perspective:
- At the core of this dialogue is the question of how to manage and reorganize vast amounts of information and tasks to reduce human load and anxiety.
- Rather than a fixed classification by project, a [[stress-free]] organization of information is possible by combining flexible methods such as links, tags, action units, and GTD.
- In addition, practical issues such as AI utilization, communication, and tool coordination have emerged, requiring more multifaceted workflow design.
