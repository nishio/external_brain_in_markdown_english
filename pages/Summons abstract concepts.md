<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, the metaphor of "summoning abstract concepts" can be understood to indicate the act of embodying or evoking certain thoughts or ideas into consciousness. This is the image of drawing out an abstract concept or philosophical idea that is difficult to grasp in everyday life, as if one were "summoning" something, and making it easier to utilize or understand in a concrete context. This metaphor can be described as an expression that emphasizes the act of invoking and making sense of the abstract in the real world.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In chatting with an AI, the metaphor of "summoning abstract concepts" would be the act of the user "invoking" certain abstract concepts or thought frameworks for the AI to incorporate into the dialogue. This can be viewed as a process of exploring new perspectives and philosophical ideas or clarifying ambiguous themes through dialogue with the AI. I envision the user using the concepts "summoned" by the AI to engage in a dialogue to interpret real-world problems and deepen ideas.
