- Discussion of [[self-assurance]] and Rorty's [Bazaar and Clubs

Rorty's [[bazaar]] reminds one of [[diversity]] or [[a place of]] exchange. Here it may refer to a place where different people gather, exchange goods and services, and enjoy [[social interaction]]. Such places create not only economic value, but also cultural and social value. People use these places not only for material gain, but also for spiritual satisfaction, such as [[empathy]] and [[a sense of belonging]].

A club, on the other hand, represents a group of people with a limited number of members who share certain common interests and goals. Club members strengthen their [[personal identity]] and sense of belonging through common goals and activities. The club serves as a place to foster close bonds [[between people]] and [[shared values]] among its members, and to distinguish [[itself from outside groups]].

If the stories of Rorty's Bazaar and the club are related, the connection may lie in concepts related to "[[community and individual identity]]" and "[[social interaction and individual self-awareness]]." Specifically, through the dynamics between the [[open social interaction]] provided by Rorty's bazaar and the closed, more [[intimate community]] provided by the club, individuals can find opportunities to lose or gain self-affirmation.

These venues provide opportunities for individuals to take action to increase their self-assurance, while at the same time reevaluating their social roles and self-positioning. While the diverse interactions in the bazaar broaden one's perspective and promote new self-awareness, the [[close relationships]] within the club provide a strong [[social support]] that underpins [[self-assurance]].

The interesting part of this statement is that the two axes are orthogonal.
In the bazaar, the term "sense of belonging" comes up and you say, "Huh? Isn't that wrong?" I think, "Is that wrong? But "sense of belonging" also appears in clubs.
These two senses of belonging are different.

Clubs are "[[closed, intimate communities]]. In other words, for most people, they are "inaccessible. Even if you catch a glimpse of the fun inside through the window, you may not know where the entrance is, and even if you knock on the door, they won't let you in. They feel a sense of alienation as a "lack of belonging.

On the other hand, the bazaar also hosts occasional events. These events are often "open to all. When you find out that an event of interest to you is going to be held, you try to attend it. When you do so, you will find that there are many people there who share your interests and you will feel a sense of "belonging. People who have felt alienated because there is no one close to them who shares their interests will feel a sense of belonging.

What I associate with writing this.
