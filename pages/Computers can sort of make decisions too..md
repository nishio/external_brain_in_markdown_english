title: "Computers can sort of make decisions too."
---

I found that there was a point where we were not on the same page. When I dug deeper, I found that we didn't share the same understanding that "computers can also make some kind of judgment.

In the past, if you wanted a computer to make a decision, you had to explicitly describe the rule. Therefore, in situations where the criteria for judgment were not clear (i.e., humans could not clearly verbalize the criteria for judgment), it was said, "We can't let the computer make the judgment.
However, advances in [[machine learning]] have made it possible to create many cases where "better decisions can be made by collecting and learning data rather than having humans describe the decision criteria.
In cases where humans are making "casual judgments" based on non-verbalized criteria, humans are making judgments based on data in the form of experience. In cases where this data is in a form that is easy for computers to handle, computers can make judgments based on more data than humans can, and thus can "sort of judge" with greater precision than humans.
