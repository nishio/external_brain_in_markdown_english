Enhance the summarization capabilities of Scrapbox users
SUMMARY: Scrapbox's titling feature encourages crystallization of content and should improve GPT-4's ability to generate titles.

As for Scrapbox, titling content functions as a kind of "summary generation" or "crystallization," and those who are familiar with Scrapbox have been trained in this ability through thousands of training sessions. Currently, if you do a cursory "titling" of GPT4, it will not be a very good Scrapbox-like title. I feel that once this "goodness" is defined and LLM is viable, it will be a better system for handling knowledge.
