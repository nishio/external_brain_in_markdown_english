> K: Actually, I wonder if computerized [[posthuman intelligence]] has already been created, and they are making this happen to squash humanity?

I'm sure he'd say.
    - >  K: And what else would you like? is definitely [[metaverse]], right?

If they develop a self-image that "the body is a tie, and the thoughts freed from it are the essence," they will recognize that interfering with other civilizations to develop computers is "to increase the land they can colonize," so of course they will do it.
