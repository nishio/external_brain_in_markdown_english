- I feel that as A increases, B increases, but I couldn't figure out why exactly A would increase B.
- This was a combination of [[Implicit Resources]] and [stochastic change
- Doing A increases the implicit resource R
- A state P changes stochastically to B
- The more resource R, the higher the probability of
