It all started when an influencer, referring to the development of AI technology, said, "Thanks to AI, even people with no talent for drawing will be able to create professional-looking illustrations. This is the democratization of talent.

Many people were repulsed by this expression "democratization of talent.

First, they pointed out that the use of the word "[[democratization]]" is problematic. Many thought that the word democratization is inherently political in nature and is not appropriate in this context.

Second, I am of the opinion that even if AI technology enables us to create things at a certain level, it is not the same as real "[[talent]]. Creativity and originality are the essence of true talent, and cannot be replaced by AI.

Third, some expressed concern that this statement seemed to reflect a desire to achieve results without effort and disregard for creators who have made the effort.

There is a lively debate on social networking sites about the appropriateness of the term "democratization of talent" and the relationship between AI technology and human creativity. It is an interesting case study of how a single choice of words can cause such great controversy.

This discussion makes us think about how society will be changed by the development of AI technology and what we should value. While technological advances certainly bring new possibilities, they also raise ethical issues. This event in Japan may pose a question that all of us living in the age of AI must face.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following claims may be helpful.

- There is a problem with the use of the term "democratization of talent. The English word "[[democratize]]" also means "[[make accessible]] to all," but the Japanese word "democratize" has no such connotation. The more appropriate words are "[[communization]]" and "[[popularization]].
- Even if the "democratization of talent ([[the commoditization of technology]])" occurs with the development of generative AI, the difference in creativity between creators and non-creators will remain. In fact, the difference will become visible.
- Behind the phrase "democratization of talent" is a desire to be "chided without effort. People who have made sincere efforts do not share this term.
- Information professionals say "[[democratization]]" to mean "[[even]] idiots can do it," but this is a misuse of the word. The words "[[commonization]]" and "[[commoditization]]" are closer to the reality.
- Using a generative AI as a tool for creation is a completely different attitude toward creation than using it as a gadget.

Overall, the majority of the comments questioned the appropriateness of the term "democratization of talent. We felt that the content was suggestive of the need to be careful in the choice and use of language.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How did this discussion come about?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The debate seems to have been triggered by someone using the term "democratization of talent" to argue that the development of AI technology would allow anyone to do what until now only a few "gifted" people could do.

Specifically, the person is presumed to have said something to the effect that "even those who lack the talent to draw will be able to create professional-looking illustrations using AI," which he described as the "democratization of talent.

In response, many people felt uncomfortable with this. The main objections are as follows

- Inappropriate use of the word "democratization." It is different from its original meaning.
- AI may allow anyone to create at a certain level, but that is not the same as real "talent". It does not fill the gap in creativity.
- The desire to achieve results without effort is apparent and seems to desecrate those who have worked hard and developed their talents.

In other words, the easy use of the term "democratization of talent" seems to have provoked a backlash against the misuse of the term, excessive expectations of AI technology, and a seeming disregard for effort.
