### Digest of Research Notes
.

My research focuses on abstracting experiences and putting them into words. This is related to Nishio's studies "Digging Down and Circular Referencing," "Detaching from Concrete Experience," and "Training in [[Symbol Manipulation]]." These studies describe training that separates abstract concepts from concrete experience and treats them as concepts.

We also often think about matters that are "experientially self-evident. This refers to matters that are obvious to those who have experienced them, but difficult to understand for those who have not. This relates to Nishio's "introduction of axioms grounded by experience" or "grounded by experience.

We further discuss "reproduction through labeling, which verbalizes the experience. This is the idea that by putting an experience into words, the experience can be reproduced. This is related to Nishio's "U Theory and Tokoroten" and "Pattern Language".

Finally, it also considers "as yet unnamed concepts that emerge from experience". This is a discussion of abstract concepts that emerge from experience, which is related to Nishio's "Polanyi's Tacit Knowledge."

As mentioned above, my research examines the abstraction of experience, putting it into words, and how these concepts relate to experience. These considerations are deeply related to Nishio's research and through them we can gain a deeper understanding.
