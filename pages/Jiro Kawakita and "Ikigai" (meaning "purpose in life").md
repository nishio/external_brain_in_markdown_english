> There are two words that I have popularized. One is "[[raison d'être]]".
>  In my 1964 book, I used the phrase "[[being worth doing]]" along with the phrase "[[being worth doing]]," but "worth doing" never caught on, only "being worth living" spread rapidly. It is noteworthy that the term "being worth doing" first became popular in the corporate world, but soon became generalized to other segments of society as well, because it was during this period that the management and administration of the company became more and more important. The reason is that there seems to be a close relationship between the further development of the managerial society that began around this time and the sense of crisis surrounding this "joie de vivre.

    - [In the chapter "Love of Creation," he cites "[[the joy of creating something new that did not exist before]]" as one of the things that make his life worth living.
- I suppose "I made it popular" is a bit of an oversimplification, and it was enlivened in the 60's by numerous references to the "purpose of life" by numerous authors.

> The other word that has gained popularity is "[[participation]]. I used it in an article I wrote in 1969. Before this, the term "[[participation]]" had gradually begun to be used by Japanese intellectuals, but I did not adopt it. But I did not adopt it.
