title: "Observations and Reflections of a Genius"
---


Not a good choice of word "genius" to begin with.
- I think the word [[genius]] is [[ambiguous]] to begin with.
        - It's a term often used by [[mediocre]] to maintain [[self-respect]] by [[isolation]] with a [[label]] saying "that's [[heterogeneous]]".
        - Well, it's better than them coming to kill me.
            - relevance
                    - [[An ordinary man killing a genius]]
                    - [[Attacking the unfamiliar without looking at it properly.]]

I feel "[Some kind of smarts.
- What is this "certain cleverness"?
    - The fact that you want to prefix the word "sort of" means that it is a different concept than the default "[[intelligence]]".
    - > [@shogochiai](https://twitter.com/shogochiai/status/1646265939405701120?s=20): this ability is not [IQ
    - > We need metrics that can measure this capability.

The [[Learning Cycle]] of an engineer's intellectual production
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/学びのサイクル/icon' alt='学びのサイクル.icon' height="19.5"/>
Normal learning process
- 1: Collect information and arrange it at the bottom
- 2: Think about it and pile it up on the top step.
- 3: Apply and learn from the results
        - [[Learning Cycle (old)]] is more well written.
        - [[I'm suspicious of anything that looks neatly put together.]]
- Some people see study as classroom learning and overlook the importance of 3

That genius is spinning the learning cycle at high speed, or is it?
- Well, you could say that and you could say that they don't.
- I get the feeling that you're jumping to the easy explanation that "the learning is greater because we're running the learning cycle at a higher speed."
- That doesn't explain the existence of a "certain kind" of "cleverness."

Learning by turning the cycle of learning is the high road.
- I feel we're taking the not-so-high road.
