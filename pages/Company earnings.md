title: "Company earnings"
---

- I've seen feedback along the lines of, "It's great that you support something that doesn't directly translate into revenue."
    - That interpretation would deny the existence of [[Research Division]] because it is not directly connected to [[earnings]].
- In terms of knowledge acquisition, the composition of an individual's study is similar.
    - The composition of gaining knowledge by doing [[research]] as a job and gaining knowledge by studying as a job are similar.
- We tend to think of "company revenue" as "cash coming into the company," but "knowledge coming into the company" is also beneficial to the company.
- You can turn knowledge into cash, but you can't turn cash into knowledge.
    - Piling up cash doesn't mean you can download knowledge to people who aren't willing to learn.
    - [[knowledge]] is a more valuable good than cash # Knowledge capital
- Employees who learn are generating [[knowledge acquisition]] revenue.
        - Just don't account for it in [[ACCOUNTANT]].
    - Running a company by looking only at accounts that do not record revenue from knowledge acquisition underestimates the benefits of knowledge acquisition.
        - This is not a good situation.
