- [[GPT o3]]
- 2025-02-01
    - I made a new icon because I'm likely to switch from [[o1 Pro]] a lot.
    - [[o3-mini-high]].
- 2025-04-18
    - The real o3 came along and used [[o4-mini-high]] instead of o3-mini-high
- 2025-04-21
    - It's not good that these are the same icons.
    - I changed the name to o3-mini-high, which is labeled o3mh.
    - The real [[o3]] will be made separately.
