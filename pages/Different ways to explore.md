- I can relate.
- Try multiple actions from a single point.
    - Of course [[one can only do one thing at a time]], so inevitably [[design it so that you can go back]].
    - After a failed experience of not taking notes during the work and not being able to go back, designing a system that allows you to go back.
- Multiple candidate states in the process
    - It is important not to rush to narrow it down to just one.
        - [[Negative Capability]] and it seems to have something to do with it.
    - There is [confluence (of rivers)
    - I think this is important.
    - I feel that those that follow multiple [[different paths]] and merge are a step more reliable.
        - [[Achievement of inclusiveness]]
