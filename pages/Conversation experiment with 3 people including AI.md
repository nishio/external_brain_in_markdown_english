- The chat begins with abstract discussions of AI, organizational theory, digital democracy, creativity and values, and then moves to specific topics in the second half, such as recording and distribution via neck-mounted cameras and long- and short-form comparisons of content.
- In short, the first part of the discussion exchanges views on abstract topics such as efficiency through AI and the state of skills, while in the second half, the conversation turns to practical and everyday topics such as actual device use and delivery methods.
- Users are interested in trying out new technologies, but are also considering their usefulness and value, their counterparts' reactions, and privacy issues.
