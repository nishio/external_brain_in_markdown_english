I realize that I agree with the assertion that "Eastern philosophy is useful in the age of AI," but I don't think it's useful.

To someone who is familiar with Eastern philosophy, it appears to be "an ambiguous statement that puts diverse things in a miscellaneous box.
To those who are not familiar with Eastern philosophy, it appears to be a "statement without substance.

We need to choose the appropriate explanation for their situation. In many cases, the bracket "Eastern philosophy" is too vague. It is a low resolution statement.
