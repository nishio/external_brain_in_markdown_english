Video that got a lot of attention with the phrase "Is SaaS Dead?" (2025/01/13)
- I'm not actually saying SaaS is going to die (but neither am I saying it will continue to exist as it is now).

Satya Nadella's statement:
- > "This time around the thing about agents is they are not going to be bound to essentially anyone’s SaaS application and its data, right? So I’ll have an agentic sort of view where the task, the intent, and I will go operate and orchestrate all the logic across multiple SaaS applications, right? I’ll go call a bunch of APIs through tools use, so I’ll call a bunch of APIs. I will in fact most likely fine-tune my model to know about multiple SaaS applications in the agent tier and so that’s what’s going to happen."
- An agent is essentially not tied to anyone's SaaS application or data. So I take an agentic view of the task and intent, manipulating and orchestrating all the logic across multiple SaaS applications. I use tools and make lots of API calls. In fact, I will probably tweak the model to know about multiple SaaS applications at the agent layer.
- > "So I think what’ll happen is these CRUD… I mean SaaS applications are a CRUD database with a lot of business logic. So the CRUD database will then get orchestrated outside of the business logic tier of just the SaaS application is what I mean is going to happen."
- In other words, the SaaS application is a CRUD database containing a lot of business logic. This means that the CRUD database is orchestrated outside the business logic layer of the SaaS application.

This statement indicates that Nadella envisions a future in which AI agents perform tasks across SaaS applications and orchestrate database CRUD operations outside of the SaaS business logic layer.

Simply put, software has been separated from "the whole of the whole" into "the logic part and the part that persists data. This is what [[(1.4.4) Model / View / Controller]] and the invention and separation of databases (RDBMS) are all about. The composition has shifted, and the [[orchestration layer]] of the agent has become the equivalent of the logic layer of the past, and SaaS has become the database layer of the past.
Personally, I think the need to operate without an agent will remain because of the overhead of time, cost, and uncertainty in the agent orchestration layer. However, the rate at which the overhead is shrinking is faster than I thought.

The following points briefly summarize the content of Satya Nadella's interview:.

- Architectural Evolution.
    - In the past, data and logic were separated from the ISAM database built into the application by a relational database.
    - SaaS has been popular in the form of CRUD operations and business logic, but new forms of SaaS will go beyond this.
- Agents appear.
    - The new paradigm will be dominated by "agents" that are not tied to individual SaaS applications, but integrate and coordinate between multiple systems.
    - Agents call multiple APIs to retrieve and integrate data for efficient workflow.
    - Examples include business processes that pull information from CRM, Office365, etc. and use unified data.
- [[SaaS is not "dead" but in a period of change.]]
    - Conventional SaaS has a "database + business logic" structure, but in the future, agents (AI assistants) will call the APIs of various SaaS and tools in an integrated manner to perform processing according to user intent.
        - As a result, the need for users to log in and operate individual SaaS is reduced, and the value of SaaS shifts to "providing data and functionality that can be referenced by agents.
- Major changes due to agentization.
    - When hiring people, "the ability to utilize agents" and "what kind of agents are available" are also important.
        - Even at the individual level, "having multiple agents dedicated to one's own use and combining them to improve work efficiency" will become commonplace.
- Opportunities for each region, including India.
    - Large-scale language models will diversify, requiring optimization models for various industries, domains, and scientific research.
        - If the development community in India and elsewhere quickly adopts new SaaS models and AI services, it will provide an opportunity for new attacks (market capture) against the major players.
- Advice to young engineers.
    - It is important for young engineers to have a "[[double gear]]" strategy of constantly trying out the latest technologies (AI and new models) while simultaneously optimizing existing systems.
    - Continuous experimentation and learning is required to keep up with rapid technological evolution (models that improve in performance every few months).
- Areas of particular interest in the future.
    - Major breakthroughs are expected in applications to science and technology (chemistry, materials, biotechnology, etc.).
        - Research combined with large-scale models could accelerate the development of new materials and drug discovery.
- Recommendations for legacy companies.
    - Giving up on implementation based on failures in past models is a loss.
        - It is necessary to start with the parts that could be used, continue with trials, and optimize them to fit the company's needs.

In short, Satya Nadella's argument is that "the era of SaaS is not over, but is changing to a new, "agent-led" form of SaaS utilization.
