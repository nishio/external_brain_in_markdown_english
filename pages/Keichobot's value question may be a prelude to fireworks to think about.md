title: "Keichobot's value question may be a prelude to fireworks to think about"
---

- [[Value Question]] in [[Keichobot, a chatbot that brings out your ideas]] may be a prelude to [Fireworks to think about

Keichobot asks, "What is it that you feel [[value]] in?" asking the question "What is your [[value]]?
- It is the role of "[[middle dot (typographical symbol used between parallel terms, names in katakana, etc.)]]" to ask this question and elicit the answer.
    - In the first half, [[delving into]] the keywords used by the user.
    - Verbalizing the user's [[values]] in the middle closure
    - In the second half, ask for [[relevance]] between keywords
- Examples of Value Questions and Answers

    - > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ultimately, I hope that human civilization will advance to the next stage, but even if I invent a great method, it will take time for it to spread throughout the human race, so I want to use a so-so method myself first to strengthen my own intellect. I feel the value of a method that I feel is strengthening my intelligence, and that is Scrapbox, Keicho, and KJ legal methodology (Regroup as a tool).
        - [[Chatbots also have the effect of focusing]]

- The questioning in the [[KJ Method Study Session Reflection Study Session]] led to a discussion about setting a theme for [[Fireworks to think about]].
- An example was given of the theme, "What is valuable to you?"
    - [[KJ method study group review study group#63a17ef5aff09e00001a54a1]]
- At the time, I thought, "I see, [[personal affair]] is important.
- In retrospect, I realized, "This is Keichobot's 'value question.
- Keichobot's asking about the relationship after asking the value question and also corresponds to creating a net by connecting lines between the relationships of the labels written out regarding the question in the thinking fireworks.

In other words, Keichobot (and [[symbolic modeling]] on which it is based) is a technology that occupies an "overlapping and slightly preliminary stage" to thinking fireworks.
- [[KJ method study group review study group#63a159e0aff09e000071597e]].
    - KJ Method ← Exploration Net ← Thinking Fireworks."
    - I talked about the gradual emergence of preliminary technologies over time.
- Keichobot could be positioned as such.
    - KJ method←Exploratory Net←Thinking Fireworks←Keichobot
    - In fact, here he says, "If it's one-on-one (= if you have time to spare), I'll dig into it with symbolic modeling questions."
        - [[KJ method study group review study group#639abbe4aff09e0000bb77b1]]
    - The reason we use "Keichobot" instead of "symbolic modeling" for the preliminary technology is that Keichobot is a chatbot, so it is important that it can be used by one person.
