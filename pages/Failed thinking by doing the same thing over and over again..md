- Variant of [Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past

There are those who think that "the same thing has been done many times before and all have failed, so this time it will fail too" in response to the current attempts being made.
- Is it "[It's the same thing.
    - If you look at the details, the surrounding conditions, etc., are different each time, so I'm just saying that "as a result of abstraction by some standard, [[they]] look the same to me.
    - How closely is the speaker in a position to observe the current situation?
        - Often totally [[outside]] and with little information.
            - That would make everything look the same to you.
            - These people's opinions are worthless.
- Is it true that "everything failed?"
    - This depends on what you define as success.
    - Often people fantasize about "great results" that ignore the constraints of reality and then describe themselves as "failures" because they do not materialize.
