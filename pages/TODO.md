title: "TODO"
---

I made a TODO tag, but you should see [search page](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/search/page?q=TODO) rather than the page title that appears below in the tag
- Because it's not about "which page," it's about "what."

#Experiments required I also made a tag.

    - Maybe you should add a "question" tag to the page where [[question]] appears.

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/TODO](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/TODO) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
