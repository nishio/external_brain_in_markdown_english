title: "Event article is dying"
---

- I attended [[Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810]] yesterday as a blogger slot and wrote an event post, but after one night I thought event posts were dead.
- Related [/shokai/not a warehouse to keep dead texts](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/not a warehouse to keep dead texts).
- I feel like I'm still alive at the time I wrote it.
    - I may add or reread it after a bit of time, but it will shortly be unedited.
    - Changed the title from "The Event Article is Dead" to "The Event Article is Dying".
- Why it will no longer be edited is because it's positioned as "[[record of past facts]]."
        - [[The Unchanging Past]] So it seems strange to rewrite

- We should let as many "[[child]]" as possible be born before the dying event article dies completely.
