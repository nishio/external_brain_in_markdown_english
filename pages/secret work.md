I think it is a kind of "hate crime. Otherwise, I don't think they could have hit and kicked the elderly (some of them women) like that.

It is said that the "recipients" and "pay-outs" are imprinted with the logic that "it is social justice to withdraw money from old people who are saving it and use it to turn the economy around" so that they don't feel guilty.

>  I get a lot of replies saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
>  It is also true that at the moment, influential figures are fomenting a division between the young and the elderly,
>  Well, it means that certain political party leaders and influencers are as fraudulent as they say they are.

> [YazMatsuki](https://x.com/YazMatsuki/status/1848831570532307301) As I watched the recent series of robberies, I was reminded of the brutally simplistic process of criminal determination in Osamu Tezuka's "Crime and Punishment (1953)," in which the perpetrator "dares not allow his victims to escape to a hidden layer. I was reminded of the brutally simplified process of criminal determination in Osamu Tezuka's "Crime and Punishment (1953).

>  This is my imagination, but I think they are eliminating more and more [[thinking people]] who return questions and sorting out the "pawns" who will do as instructed.

> [jiei_yushi](https://x.com/jiei_yushi/status/1847491669899489611) Well, but the fact that dark work is popular is because the [[real economy]] is not smooth (or the mechanism of the real economy is not trusted), and [[jiei_yushi The reason why people are becoming more conspicuous who appeal to direct action instead of elections is because the democratic system is dysfunctional, and in the Heian period, it was the end of the [[Ritsuryo]] system. The [[age of the manor and samurai]] is coming.
