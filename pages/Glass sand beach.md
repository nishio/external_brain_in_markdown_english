2016
> The Nagasaki Prefectural Environmental Health Research Center decided to promote the growth of bivalves that feed on phytoplankton and focused on clams, whose larvae easily gather in the surrounding waters. Clam larvae prefer sand particles of about 1 mm, which is too fine for natural muddy sand. The center came up with the idea of using artificial sand made of glass grains of the size preferred by clams.
>  After spreading artificial sand, about 220 clams per square meter were found one year later. Five years later, they spread artificial sand over approximately 200 meters, and in January of the following year, they confirmed 525 clams per square meter.
