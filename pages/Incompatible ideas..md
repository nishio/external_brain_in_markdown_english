If you think you have an idea A that you have and [[incompatible ideas]] B

In the first place, since the brain of another person is [[unobservable]], the idea that "the other person has idea B" is an [[interpretation]] you have made from [[observed fact]], a hypothesis that may or may not be true.

So first, this hypothesis may be wrong.

Second, the idea that "A and B are [[incompatible]]" could be wrong.
For example, if you insist on a black circle and the other party insists on a white square, at first glance they seem incompatible. However, if you listen carefully, you will find that the other party is more concerned about the square and less concerned about the color, while you are more concerned about the black color and less concerned about the shape. Then, if you make a black square, both parties will be satisfied.
- [[Assumption that what you value should also be valued by the other party]] is common.

Then there are cases that are indeed incompatible, but are simply [[Misalignment of Observation Facts]], where [[confrontation]] can be resolved by simply [[information sharing]] with each other. In the figure, the opinion that most of the facts are white and the opinion that most of the facts are black are incompatible. However, this is simply a difference in the referenced facts.
