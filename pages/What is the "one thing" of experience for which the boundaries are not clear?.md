    - What is "one" in the case of "one"?
    - The human experience is a blur without clear boundaries that can be thick in places.

        - If you try to describe the dense areas of this diagram, how much of it is "just one thing" and how much is "the whole of that thing"?
        - You claim it's "best if it's ~ and ~," but is that feasible?
            - A clear boundary can be achieved by wrapping only one grain.
            - Seems unfeasible for something that has no clear boundaries.
    - This "should be atomic" is
        - It's not, "You can always be atomic, so you should try to be atomic."
        - I think it's, "There are a lot of things you can't do atomically, but hopefully you can make it as atomic as possible."
