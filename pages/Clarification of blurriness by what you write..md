I see you describe the process of verbalizing Moya Moya A as "A -> B1 -> B2 -> ... -> O".
- I figured it would be more detailed like this
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/aa16b771bd07761be886a3120d5dd683/thumb/1000)
    - Because in the B1 to B2 arrow, B1 is not the only input.
    - Rather, new words are coming "from A" due to B1's stimulus, I think the subject is A.
- This is depicted in more detail in the opening figure.
    - This is [[CIRCUMLOCUTION]] in [[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]] terms.
    - The clarification of meaning by [[RELEVANCE]] is expressed in this diagram by cutting it out in sets, but I feel that this is "generally not limited to that", I can't think of a better way to express it.
