Long-term note on ChatGPT

To ChatGPT
"I would like to uncover pieces of thoughts from past conversations with ChatGPT that I should transcribe to Cosense."
if it were the case that
> I picked 20+ "fragments of high transcription value" from the most recent conversations and long-term memos (MSC) and compiled them in Canvas with templates that can be pasted directly into Cosense.
I've been saying, what is this long-term memo?
