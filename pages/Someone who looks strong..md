title: "Someone who looks strong."

Often it happens that people who seem strong are not "strong people".
    - [[The parable of the frightened cat]]
    - [[Appeal to Strength]]
    - [[Mounting is born of insecurity.]]

They are not strong, so if we act carelessly, they will corner us on their own and bite us.

It's exactly like a cat.
