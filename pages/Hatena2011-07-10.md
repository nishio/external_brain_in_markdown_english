*1310289934* The name of that song is not Scarab Fair.
For those of you who googled "what's the name of that song, not Scarab Fair..." and couldn't find it five minutes ago, it's "Scarborough Fair." I'll write it down. <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AB%E3%83%9C%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2'>Scarborough Fair - Wikipedia</a>
