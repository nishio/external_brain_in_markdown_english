- The representation of the process called [[expression]], [[association]], and [[internalization]] in the [[SECI Model]], from my experience as a book author.
- In the process of writing a book, the author's [[experience]] must first be output as word fragments
    - Books do not have the volume to convey the entire experience, and most of the information of the experience is lost in writing.
        - [[Detached from context]]
- Combine its fragments
    - To create a [[story]] to convey a higher, abstract, concept that is situated away from the experience to be conveyed
    - Stories are stepping stones placed in small leaps to take the reader from low to high
- Readers read written books and correspond what is written to their own past experiences or gain experiences that correspond to the content of the book by referring to it and acting on it.
