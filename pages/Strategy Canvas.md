        - p.55

- Why not on the radar chart?
    - Because there are an infinite number of axes, and the radar chart masks the fact that new things can be created.
    - Same as I wrote in [radar chart and knowledge distribution chart#5add661caff09e00006b33a0
        - Radar charts have a finite definition range.
            - Definition range of knowledge distribution map is infinite
            - There's a sense that new fields of knowledge are being created all the time.
