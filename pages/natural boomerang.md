> [s_opaque](https://x.com/s_opaque/status/1851530887093264527) You say it sounds right at first glance, but then which space should trans women use in public baths and restrooms? So, there is no safe choice, and that is nothing but social discrimination.
>  You're not thinking, "I'm a guy with a body, so why don't I just use the men's room?" are you? ......

> [HalMementomori](https://x.com/HalMementomori/status/1851654406313476199) Men's restrooms and men's bathrooms are dangerous.
>  You could appeal to men to use it safely.

> [s_opaque](https://x.com/s_opaque/status/1851658741609103421) Why should trans women have to suffer the wrinkles of "men's issues"?
>  "jointly and severally liable because they are the same man"?

> [yowa_stomach](https://x.com/yowa_stomach/status/1851752824130220145) Why should women have to suffer the wrinkles of "trans women's (men's) problems"?
>  "jointly and severally liable even though they are not even of the same sex"?
