### Digest of Research Notes
.

The KJ method, developed by Jiro Kawakita, is a methodology for structuring information and training metacognition, and for the dissemination and education of the KJ method, it is important not only to understand the theory but also to experience and reflect on it through practice.

### Fragment of relevant research note
.

- "Cumulative Effects of the KJ Method": the effects of the KJ method are cumulative.
- "Virtual Kawakita Jiro and Pseudo-Pair KJ Method": by acquiring the theory of Kawakita Jiro's KJ method and using it as training data, future humans may be able to implement virtual Kawakita Jiro and pseudo-pair KJ method.
- "Weekly 2023-01-13": Jiro Kawakita himself found common structure early on in the KJ method and in the type of teamwork where multiple people bring their perspectives together, but when he began offering educational services, the idea that he had to do it right and that he had to get formal training was born.
- "About pictures and the KJ method": the KJ method allows for the use of pictures as well as text.
- "Knowledge Creation Theory": the KJ method is positioned as part of knowledge creation.
- "KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork": KJ Method study sessions allow participants to learn in depth about specific methods and concepts.
- "I tried the KJ method": the KJ method is a bottom-up structuring method for generating new ideas.
- "Nodal Point of Thought 8/29/2018": the KJ method is a technique that is always unfinished and in the process of trial and error. Therefore, snapshots at that point in time are recorded, which are then distributed commercially to attract attention.

### Deep thoughts and opinions

From these notes and fragments, the importance of the KJ method and the challenges to its dissemination become clear: the KJ method is an effective technique for structuring information and generating new ideas, but it requires experience and reflection to understand and practice the theory. In addition, the KJ method is a constantly evolving technique, and its widespread recognition and dissemination will be achieved through the recording of snapshots of what is happening at any given point in time. However, its dissemination requires education and training, and specific methods and programs are needed for this purpose.

The KJ method is an information structuring methodology developed by Jiro Kawakita, which can be used to train metacognition. However, it is unclear why it is not widely used and how it can be disseminated overseas. In the "KJ Method Discussion in Problem Solving Compendium," the importance of the sense of "fit" in "group organization" is pointed out, which is related to the "pleasure response" in "Synectics" and the "felt sense" in "Focusing. In the [[Area type]] of the "NM method," it is recommended that the most distant objects be linked to each other.

Nishio's research notes provide insights into understanding and teaching the KJ method, the process of learning and practice, clarity of objectives and results, feasibility with machines, comparison with other methodologies, and learning costs. Given these considerations, it is clear that not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are important for the dissemination and education of the KJ method. It would also be useful to clarify the objectives and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies.

### Considerations and questions

For the dissemination and education of the KJ method, not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are considered important. However, further research is needed to determine what specific practices are necessary and what kind of reflection is effective. It is also considered useful to clarify the purpose and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies; however, further research is needed on what specific comparisons are effective and how to clarify the purpose and results.

The KJ method is an information structuring methodology developed by Jiro Kawakita that can be used to train metacognition. But what is the reason it is not widely used? Is it bad education, bad tools, or is it only learned through practice? What approach would be needed to disseminate it to an international audience?

According to the KJ Method Considerations for Problem Solving Compendium, the "[[nicely]] felt sense" in the "[[grouping]]" of the KJ method is important and is related to the "[[pleasure reaction]]" in "[[synectics]]" and the "[[felt sense]]" in "[[focusing]]. The "[[felt sense]]" of "[[synectics]]" and "[[focusing]]" are related to the "[[felt sense]]" of "[[synectics]]".

The "Emulator" details the process of learning and practicing the KJ Method. The "Landing Point of the KJ Method" discusses the clarity of the KJ Method's objectives and outcomes. The "Nodes of Thought 2019-02-18" considers the possibility of a machine performing the KJ method. Diary 2022-06-04" proposes a comparison of the KJ method with other methodologies. The Cost of Learning KJ" discusses the time and effort required to learn the KJ method.

Taking this information into consideration, it is clear that not only an understanding of the theory, but also experience and reflection through practice are important for the dissemination and education of the KJ method. It would also be useful to clarify the objectives and results of the KJ method and to understand the characteristics of the KJ method through comparison with other methodologies.

The elements of thinking are almost identical to the KJ method, but the combinations and procedures are different. In addition, the Kozane method, an intellectual production technique for singular individuals, is considered part of the KJ method.

The first BMOT special class, "Intellectual Production," emphasizes investing in knowledge-producing techniques and confirms the usefulness of the KJ method. However, it was noted that the problem is that few people have started using the KJ method.

In "Summary of Reactions to the Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers, Part 2," it is shown that the KJ method and abstraction are linked. In addition, the "Summary for the 2021-08-08 Kozaneba Interim Presentation" highlights the need for people overseas to use the KJ method and the Kozaneba method.

In "Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition," the KJ method is presented as a method for streamlining the combining of information. Also, in "Digest for Sticky Notes," the KJ method is recognized as part of an engineer's intellectual production technique.

### Deep thoughts and questions

Intellectual production techniques such as the KJ method and the Kozane method are important tools for efficient information combination and structuring. But why are these techniques not widely used? And what approaches are needed to disseminate these techniques to a foreign audience?

And while the KJ method and the Kozane method are recognized as intellectual production techniques for singular individuals, are these techniques applicable to the intellectual production of groups or entire organizations? Or are new methods and tools needed?

Further research and practice is needed to answer these questions.

### Digest of Research Notes

The KJ method, which Jiro Kawakita called the "paper-kire method," was intended to summarize large amounts of qualitative data ("the term KJ method is ambiguous"). However, in the process of teaching the KJ method, it was applied to a wide variety of purposes by Jiro Kawakita himself and others around him, and as a result, the term "KJ method in the narrow sense" came to be used to distinguish the original KJ method from these applied methods ("KJ method study group @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1").

However, in "On the Correctness of the KJ Method," he states that the goal is not to do the KJ method correctly, but to choose the appropriate means to achieve the goal. Also, 90% of the diagrams created by Jiro Kawakita were not created using the KJ method, but using the "exploratory net.

In "Beyond the KJ Method," Jiro Kawakita shows how the KJ method has changed over time and has been applied to a wide variety of purposes. While many people recognize the KJ method as an activity in which a large number of people write down and summarize information on sticky notes, Jiro Kawakita himself stated that undesirable compromises can occur if a person does it alone first and does not have sufficient maturity in his/her abilities.

From this information, we can draw the conclusion that the KJ method is one method, its application and interpretation depends on individual objectives and situations, and that there are other methods as well as the KJ method, and it is important to select and use them appropriately.

### Considerations and questions

The diversity of applications and interpretations of the KJ method demonstrates the flexibility and broad applicability of the method, but also seems to introduce ambiguity in its definition and understanding. What impact does this have on the teaching and dissemination of the KJ method?

I would also like to know more about the specific methods and effectiveness of the "exploratory nets" that Jiro Kawakita primarily used. what are the differences between the KJ method and exploratory nets, and what are the situations and purposes for which each is appropriate?

Furthermore, are there other methods and tools besides KJ-method and Expedition Net that aid intellectual production? Can those methods and tools be combined with the KJ method and Expedition Net to make intellectual production more effective?
