title: "Belief that the strong win the competition."
---

There are those who believe that "the strong always win [[competition]]."
- My own experience of winning the competition reinforces this belief.
- Observing that the strong lose to competition through luck weakens them.
- If you yourself lose the competition,
    - I consider myself weak → [[learned helplessness]].
    - I think I am strong, but luck and the world are not right, so I don't think I am valued correctly -> [[ressentiment]].

When this belief is strong, it creates the interpretation that "the reason we lose to competition is because we are weak."
- As a result, no matter what we observe, the belief that "the strong always win [[the competition]]" will not be overridden.
    - [[Positive feedback]]

This is [[interesting]] because it is both a [[human bug]] that derails individual cognition and [[Structural Problems in the Human System]].
