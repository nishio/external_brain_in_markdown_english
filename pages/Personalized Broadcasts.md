- I found Ken's remarks at [[2025-11-20 8:30]] quite insightful.
- "[[Broadcast]]" used to be merely a [[copy]], but with the advancement of LLMs, personalized broadcasts are emerging.
- When attempting to illustrate this, I realized the need for a detailed understanding of the concept of "personalization."
    - The initial image in my mind was a diagram with arrows below, differing in the distribution of red and blue.
    - However, when I tried to draw it, I felt it was odd for the arrows coming from the sender above to be red and blue.
    - In other words, expressing personalization through color blending implicitly assumes multiple senders.
        - Similar to the [[SmartNews Left-Right Slider]].
    - In the current diagram, the sender is broadcasting a large amount of information, and the way it is filtered, selected, or summarized varies.
        - Similar to the explanation detail level in [[Mirai Parliament]].
