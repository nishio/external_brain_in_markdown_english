Busy" and "keep busy."
I don't think it's nuanced enough.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There is certainly a difference in nuance between "busy" and "make busy."
    - [[Busy]] : An adjective describing one's situation, indicating that one's [[Schedule]] or [[Task]] is packed due to external factors. Busy] : Indicates that you are already busy, e.g., "I'm busy at work right now.
- [[Busy]]: This term describes a situation in which one intentionally increases one's own actions or tasks to make oneself busy. As in "I make myself busy," it includes the nuance of creating one's own busyness.

In other words, "busy" has a strong sense of dependence on [[external factors]], while "busy" has a strong nuance of being the result of [[spontaneous]] action.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I see, you say that we create the situation voluntarily based on [[intrinsic motivation]] to be busy.
- I've been busy lately.
- Let's take a little [[time off]].
