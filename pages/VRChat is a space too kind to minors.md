title: "VRChat is a space too kind to minors"
---

> [Kuroly7](https://x.com/Kuroly7/status/1829005372620931461) VRChat communication is tuned to adults who are tired of society, so anything they do (regardless of the extent of their achievements) is met with "Great! Wow!" and "Wow!" no matter what they do (regardless of their achievements), and I have a feeling that it is a space that is extremely too kind to minors.

Well, they don't have a [[place]] in [[physical society]], so they come to [[friendly net space]], and the only reason it works is because VRChat is still a [[remote]] place without a [[majority]], so let them go for now.
Like telling them that all adults understand that this space will be gone in a few years, so if you're going to bet your entire life on this place, you need to be reasonably prepared?
We can only see what we can see, and it takes imagination to imagine what we can't see.
