The pro-Christian forces in Kyushu, especially the feudal lords, were greatly affected by the period of Christian suppression in the early 17th century. The following is a detailed account of the major movements and their subsequent status.
- Acceptance of Christianity by feudal lords: In the late 16th century, some feudal lords in Kyushu, notably [[Omura Junchu]] and [[Otomo Sorin]], accepted Christianity and allowed its propagation in their territories.
- [In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued a decree banning Christianity. This forced some feudal lords to change their attitude toward Christianity.
- [[Battle of Sekigahara]]: After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu united the country and established the Tokugawa shogunate. The Shogunate adopted a policy of eliminating Christianity.
- Suppression of Christianity: In the early 17th century, the suppression of Christianity was further intensified and Christians were persecuted. Christian feudal lords were also affected, and many of them either renounced Christianity or continued their faith as hidden Christians.
- [[Shimabara Rebellion]]: In 1637-1638, the Shimabara Rebellion, a revolt led by Christians, took place on the Shimabara Peninsula and Amakusa Islands in Kyushu. The rebellion was crushed by the Shogunate forces, and Christianity was further suppressed after the rebellion.

As a result, the pro-Christian forces in Kyushu either distanced themselves from Christianity or continued their faith in hiding under the Tokugawa Shogunate's strong policy of suppressing Christianity. Open Christianity among the feudal lords and their subjects disappeared after this period.
