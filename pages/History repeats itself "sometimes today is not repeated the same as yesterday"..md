title: 'History repeats itself "sometimes today is not repeated the same as yesterday".'
---

The "[[History repeats itself]]" is correct, but the [[concept resolution]] of the "[[repeat]]" needs to be higher.
- What you think "this repeats itself" in smaller units becomes "it doesn't repeat itself" in larger units.
- This phenomenon is repeating itself.
- Repeat after me, "Sometimes today is not repeated the same as yesterday."

- [[History]]
