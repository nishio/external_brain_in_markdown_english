Misconceptions about understanding (COMPREHENSION)
- The one who creates the metaphor first has a felt meaning and then creates the metaphor.
- The person reading the metaphor sees the metaphor first, then understands it.
    - I'm afraid I'm understanding this wrong from here.
- 「 [[Conversation is not table tennis, but music]] 」
- Tradition is to keep the fire burning."
    - I guess that means it's important to protect them from disappearing - right?
    - Tradition is about preserving the fire, not worshipping the ashes.
    - Instead of worshipping the ashes that are a byproduct of the fire and no longer change, we should work to keep the fire that is currently creating new light alive, which is what preserving tradition means.
        - [There is no tradition without creation.
    - Fire is a metaphor for creation
