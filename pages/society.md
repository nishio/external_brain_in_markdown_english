title: "society"
---

In Japanese, a person who graduated the university called [[社会人]].
[[社会]] is society and [[人]] is person. However `society person` does not seem natural English.
The word [[社会人]] was used in [[(1.2.1.2) How much time can you spend for learning?]] in Japanese version.

Replacement candidate:

- person who graduate university
    - (feel incompatible) Even if a 30-years-old person did not graduate university, he may be [[社会人]].
- if you have a full time job
    - (feel incompatible) Even if a 30-years-old person does not have a job, he may be [[社会人]].

Is it similar to the concept of "[[adult]]?"

I used same word in [[(5.3) Tuning for busy people]], but in this case it just means busy people.
