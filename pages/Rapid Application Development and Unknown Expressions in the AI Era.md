Rapid App Development] and [[Unknown Expression]] in the AI Era
Summary: In the age of AI, the value of building frameworks and miscellaneous representations of unknown domains and the development of products focused on actual demand is emphasized.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - [[mind-map]] とかはマルチヘッド的だなと思った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/inajob/icon' alt='inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- after writing[[時間を置いて見返す]]と、[[枝が伸びる]]ことがある、この時に伸びる枝は描いた時に「最後に描いた枝」とは限らない<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Moving from a time-based structure to a topic-based structure.
    - Similar to Scrapbox bullet points with comments in the form of bullets.
        - Branches grow like plants, then they are cut out.
        - [[Harvesting Architecture]]

- [[Harvesting the Framework]]
- > First, one app is created, then another app is created based on the same code base, and after repeating this several times, the framework becomes stable and the code base can be separated.
- The current activity is about "[[intellectual production in the age of AI]]," building an app, building another app, and repeating the process at high speed.
- By doing this, we are "extending the branch".
- It is harvested from it after the fact.

Instead of kneading [[academic gossip]] for zero customers, create something that meets the actual demand of a small group of users and repeat the creation and improvement process at high speed
- [[Product/User Fit]]

- [[Creating the unknown]]
    - [[Systematization of the unknown]]
- Creating a program is systematization
        - [[Make it messy anyway.]]
    - > The first person to write the damn code is greater than any good [[methodologist]]. He/she somehow managed to express the [[domain]] that no one else [[represented]], albeit poorly.

Scrapbox's compatibility with intellectual production is due to its natural support for [[multi-head thinking]].
