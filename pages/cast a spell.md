title: "cast a spell"

The human spirit can be transformed by repeated input of how it should be.
It is described as "distorting" or "[[cursing]]" in reference to a deformation that is not good, but could it also be used in a good direction?

When a curse is placed on another person, the interests of the surgeon and the target are not aligned, so the form is likely to be harmful to the target. Is this not the case when the surgeon targets himself?
