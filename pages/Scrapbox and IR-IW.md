I was wondering how to implement [[Incremental Reading]] in [[Scrapbox]], but I thought that we could have [[Slack]] notify us of updates and have a bot on Slack watch it and notify us in a week or so. You could do something like "[[What happened one year ago]]" on [[Facebook]].

[[Incremental Writing]] re-posts fragments previously written in [[Spaced Repetition]], but Scrapbox does it with links. It is necessary to control this.
