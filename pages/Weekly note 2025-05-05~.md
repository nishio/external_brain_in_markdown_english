Week in Review
- Some people went into Golden Week early, but I went into it before I really thought about it, so I didn't get to make it a holiday weekend or anything.
- I see that 5/3, 5/4 are Saturday and Sunday this year.
    - I spent it as a normal Saturday and Sunday in a normal rhythm.
- 5/2 Plurality book release!
- It's good to see Devin starting to be used as a gun in Digital Democracy 2030.
- Implementing a PubCom analysis tool for the analysis of pubCom
