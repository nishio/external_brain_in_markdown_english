title: "Writing normally makes for long, blog-like sentences."

Remarks by [[Tadanori Kurashita]] at [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810

- From an Evernote-like perspective, it feels under-featured, there is not enough information to be automatically captured.
- I read [/shokai/Scrapbox Philosophy](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/Scrapbox Philosophy) and thought, "Well.
    - 「 [[Not a warehouse of dead texts.]] 」
    - There is no point in taking it in automatically.
    - It makes sense to write your own description and add your own links.
- I don't think I would have understood it if I first read the philosophy of shokai, I understood it because I used it for a while before I read it.
    - The writing itself shows the philosophy
    - The normal way of writing would be long, blog-like sentences.
    - That page embodies how it should be used.
