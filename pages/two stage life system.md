> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1888920253574602898) I thought it was interesting to see you talk about a two-stage life system, but the point you made in your reply about playing stage 2 as a kid was even more interesting.
>  >[tenche1204](https://x.com/tenche1204/status/1888920253574602898) More and more people are realizing that they are in the capitalist game, but many do not realize that life is a happiness point maximization game! >[[tenche1204]] >[tenche1204

> [Kartenvoy2](https://x.com/Kartenvoy2/status/1889236773722816760) No, I know, but don't too many adults forget that they played the second stage when they were kids?
>  The first stage is the mechanism by which adulthood occurs. The essence of life lies in the second stage.
>  It is the nature of capitalist society that increasing assets can manipulate a child's initial position.

Below is a brief summary of the main points.

## Basic concept of the two-stage life system
.

1.### Stage 1: [capitalism game
.
    - Objective: to acquire a basis for living (i.e., money and "[[the]] right not to have to sell time")
        - Method: Utilize a mechanism to convert labor income into asset income
    - Caution: A bias toward [[FIRE]] ([[Early Retirement]]) strategies can easily lead to a lack of skills and fulfillment needed in the second stage.

2.### Stage 2: Pursuit of maximizing happiness points
.
    - Purpose: Use your free time to pursue true happiness in activities based on your values.
        - Characteristics: [[measures of happiness]] vary from person to person ([[close relationships]], [[scholarship]], [[contribution to society]], etc.) and include [values that money can't buy
    - Risk: If you go in unprepared, you may find yourself in a "money but no happiness" situation.
    - relevance
            - [[Maximize life's happiness]]
            - [[Dominion and Life]]

3.### Importance of balance between both stages
.
    - In the process of clearing the first stage, preparation for the second stage must proceed in parallel.
        - Strategically balancing the use of work and free time around your favorite things and passions will maximize your ultimate happiness.

## Childhood and Stage 2

- Interesting point:
- 'When I was a kid, I played stage two.'
- → The perspective is that during childhood, people naturally pursued their own interests and pleasures in their free time, and lived their original 'happiness-pursuing' lives.
- → It also serves as a wake-up call that as adults, we are bound by the rules of society (stage 1) and tend to forget our true "meaning of life" and sense of happiness.

This summary includes a perspective that views life as a two-step process, a "[[capitalist game]]" and a "[[happiness pursuit game]]," and reaffirms the value of the free pursuit of happiness that we naturally experienced as children.
