title: "Is it necessary?"
---

Do you need it?" I think [[If you're not convinced you need it, you don't need it.]], but I'm interested in why you don't come to that conclusion.

Someone says, "I need X," and you feel, "I don't seem to need X," but you don't feel confident in that judgment?

Are we so accustomed to being told we "need" to do things we don't really understand the necessity of through schooling or other means that we feel compelled to do them when others tell us we need to do them?

- I've been surprised that the word [[necessary]] was taken to mean something stronger than I assumed.
    - [[nibble from where you need to]] I think we were talking about "how do you determine if you need it or not?"
    - When you say, "Is it necessary?" that's not necessary because there's "no clear reason to think it's necessary."
    - Do it after the need becomes apparent [[(1.3.1.1) Delayed evaluative study method]].
