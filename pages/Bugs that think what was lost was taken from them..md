title: "Bugs that think what was lost was taken from them."
---

- [[natural phenomenon (phenomena)]] or [[lost]] by [[one's own mistake]], thinking that others have [[taken]] it away [[human bug]].
- Attacking individuals who just happen to be nearby who didn't take it from you with a "you took it from me" attitude.

What if we multiply this by "[[loss of ability]] as a natural phenomenon due to [[aging]]"?
- Feel deprived of their abilities
    - Not many people think that "[[ability]]" in the literal sense can be taken away like material things.
    - Instead, they think that "[[results]] were taken away," "[[opportunity]] was taken away," or "the [[attention]], [[reputation]], or [[praise]] that I should have gained was taken away.
    - Thinking that way, they attack anyone who happens to be nearby.
- This is another [[principle of generation of old people]].
