title: "If there is a difference in cognitive ability, then there is a discrepancy in observed facts."
---

For a proposition X, Mr. A thinks "it is clear from observed facts" and Mr. B thinks "there is no such observed fact".

From Mr. A, Mr. B appears to be "a fool with inferior cognitive abilities.
    - [[Cognitive Resolution]]
From Mr. B, Mr. A appears to be "a madman who believes in something that does not exist.
    - [[Unsubstantiated Confidence.]]

No one knows which is right.
- This is a hypothesis, we just haven't found a solution at the moment.
- Sometimes B's side claims their righteousness by the sheer number of people, but this is not an argument.
    - Because there are instances where the majority was stupid.
        - This, too, will only deepen the conflict on A's side, as he will see it as "you are a fool with inferior historical awareness skills to use that as an argument.
        - [[Unsubstantiated delusion that the majority is right.]]

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]
- No picture yet.
- I mean, it's one level of meta.
    - Because a series where two people say different things is generally "two people observe the same thing and what they perceive is different".

Further Development
- Doesn't B have an unfounded confidence in proposition Y that "I can recognize the basis for A's belief that proposition X is true"?

supplement
- If it's something that can be verified by experimentation, then we can experiment and see which one is right.
    - For example, if the proposition is "this will happen in 50 years," you have to wait 50 years.
