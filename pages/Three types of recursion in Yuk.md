Three types of recursion in Yuk
- The "three kinds of recursion" proposed by [[Yuk Hui]] (Yuk Hui) are important concepts in the philosophy of technology and contemporary thought that provide a framework for viewing the relationship between technology, self, and society. These are perspectives from which to rethink how technological developments are changing the relationship between humans and the world.

Below is an explanation of each [[recursion]].

1. personal recursivity
summary
The process by which an individual reflectively understands himself or herself and adjusts his or her way of being and acting.
Here, recursivity focuses on an individual's internal sense of self and self-formation.
feature
Humans reconstruct themselves by reflecting on their actions and experiences.
Technology affects this recursion.
Example: Social media and digital data have a significant impact on self-image and self-perception.
Through the feedback loop, humans reexamine their own data (behaviors, choices, and preferences).
Example
Smartphone apps visualize personal health and behavioral data and encourage people to change their health habits.
Self-helpful acts (e.g., meditation, journaling) are processes that enhance personal recursion.

Social Recursivity
summary
A process for society to understand itself and change.
This involves the restructuring of shared values and behaviors within a culture, institution, or group.
feature
Society adjusts itself to reflect the effects of individual and collective actions.
Digital technologies and infrastructure are transforming social interactions and decision-making processes.
Example: Algorithm provides recommendations and decisions based on social behavior patterns.
More data-driven decision making in politics and economics.
Example
Likes and shares on social networking sites shape social discussions, and conversely, these discussions influence individual behavior.
A process in which public policies are flexibly adjusted to incorporate citizens' behavioral data and opinions.

3. cosmic recursivity
summary
The process by which humans reconstruct their relationship with nature and the universe.
This recursivity provides a perspective that goes beyond the individual and society to rethink the relationship between technology and the universe as a whole.
feature
The focus here is on the interaction between humans and non-human entities (nature, technology, the universe as a whole).
Technology is not merely a tool, but serves to reshape man's place in the universe.
Example: global technological initiatives in the context of climate change.
Digital technology and artificial intelligence seek order and harmony on a cosmic scale.
Example
An attempt to build a sustainable society based on an awareness of the impact of human behavior on the global environment and climate.
Through space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, we rethink man's place in the universe as a whole.
4. human relationship with technology through recursion
Yuk Hui's "Three Types of Recursion" provides a multi-layered framework for understanding the relationship between technology and people.

Role of Technology:.
Technology is not just a tool, but recursively has the power to change the way individuals, society, and the universe are.
Recursive feedback loops:.
The recursive nature of the individual, society, and the universe interact with each other, and technology acts as a mediator.
Ethical Aspects of Technology:.
Through the process of recursion, we need to ethically reconsider the impact of technology on humans and the universe as a whole.
5. application to modern society
The three types of recursion in Yuk Hui can be applied in the following areas

(1) Individuals and Technology
The role of digital devices in personal self-formation (e.g., wearable devices and AI assistants).
(2) Social Infrastructure
How social media and big data are transforming social values and decision-making.
(3) Environmental ethics
Examines how technological developments affect the global environment and the cosmic order.
6. conclusion
Yuk Hui's "Three Kinds of Recursivity" is a comprehensive framework for understanding how the impact of technology extends to the individual, society, and the universe as a whole. This perspective is key to resolving the ethical and philosophical issues of technology in today's digital society.
