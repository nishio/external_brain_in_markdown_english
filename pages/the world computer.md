[Explaining Ethereum: Interview with Vitalik Buterin (Part 1)](https://hir.harvard.edu/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-1/) [[Vitalik]]
(DeepL)
- The idea behind the [[world computer]] metaphor is that [[ethereum]] is this common global platform;
- It is a platform where anyone can upload a piece of code called a [[smart contract]]. Anyone can publish a smart contract, send a transaction and interact with the smart contract, and the code will run on the blockchain.
- There are different applications created by different people and these different applications can talk directly to each other. If I create a smart contract, it becomes my application. And if I create another smart contract application, that application can talk to my application. That application could be embedded in a workflow and talk to my application. So in this tightly interconnected environment, anyone can create things, and anyone can run things. The code, of course, all runs in the open and clear. Everyone can see what is going on, and everyone can make sure that everything is running correctly.
- The idea is to give people the same feeling as if they were operating a single computer. The network consists of thousands of computers, but by creating an environment where all programs can talk to each other and be closely connected, everyone can feel as if they are placing and creating things on the same computer. That is the idea behind World Computer.
