title: "study and fall prey to confirmation bias."
---

If we inadvertently fall into the "read a lot of books and [[study]] a lot" style of behavior, we may be stuck in the "confirmation bias" of supporting our initial randomly acquired beliefs with texts we read later in life.

In the case of learning programming, if you acquire a false belief from reading a book, you can get out of that [[mistaken belief]] by writing a program according to that belief and observing that it does not work as expected.

For those areas of low [[verifiability]], we need to focus on statements that contradict beliefs, keeping in mind that it is easy to fall prey to confirmation bias.
