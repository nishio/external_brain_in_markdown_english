This dialogue is between Taiwan's Minister of Digital Audrey Tan and Professor Beth Novick of Northeastern University. Key points include.

- Tan aims to leverage the diversity of Taiwanese society and turn conflict into co-creation through the use of AI and technology. He has also utilized the wisdom of civil society in pandemic response, for example.
- To resolve the conflict between democracy and technology, it is important to make AI systems open source and available to all; AI consensus building systems should not be concentrated in the hands of a few.
- Deepfakes and other threats in elections are countered with advance awareness and multifaceted recording and disclosure. After the election, we are evolving a system that allows citizens' voices to be used in policy making.
- His advice to young people is to think of better solutions, not to be bound by existing assumptions. Also, for the development of democracy, it is important to keep reproducing diversity and dissent.
    - Minister Tan urges young people to think beyond existing assumptions to better solutions. He points out that the trade-offs that have been made may be due to legacy thinking, and explains the importance of thinking outside the existing framework.
    - Minister Tan also introduced that each Taiwanese government minister has appointed a "reverse mentor" under the age of 35. He said that the young people's perspectives help them realize that existing trade-offs are a relic of the past and that new ideas are possible. Minister Tan himself said that he is inspired by the young advisors.
    - He also argues that for democracy to develop, it is essential to keep reproducing diversity and dissent, so that even when consensus is reached through AI and everyone accepts the conclusions, it is not enough to stop there, but rather new lines of conflict must be created. He believes that a democracy that is too perfect will close the door to future possibilities, so it is important to maintain an imperfect democracy that is constantly changing.
- In his new book, "Plurality," he discusses the future of collaborative technologies and democracy that make the most of diversity.
    - In his new book, "Plurality," he discusses the future of democracy, which will use collaborative technologies to transform diversity into power. In addition to transforming division into the power of co-creation, he also focuses on how to reproduce diversity and dissent far into the future.

It is clear that Tan is a digital minister who believes in the power of technology, but also practices and proposes ways to use it democratically.
