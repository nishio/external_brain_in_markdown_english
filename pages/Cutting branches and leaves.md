I have often experienced that if you cut [[foliage]] when the volume is too large, you end up with [[abstract]] concepts that are not concrete and cannot be understood by the audience. It's difficult.
    - [[Speed reading for those without accumulated knowledge]]
    - [[How to give knowledge to those who lack knowledge]]
- They're both relevant, but not the best match for this situation.
- Talking about something in a [[lightning talk]] with limited time is a situation similar to having "[[people with insufficient knowledge]]" do "[[speed reading]]".
        - [[presentation]] 系は、誰をどこに連れて行きたいのか を考えて作ることが多いな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Maybe in books or blogs or something.
