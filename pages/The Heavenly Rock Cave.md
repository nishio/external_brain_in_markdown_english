The term is most known in relation to the myth of "Amano-Iwato," which is a pivotal story in the Japanese creation myth. According to the myth, the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], who is a central deity in [[Shinto]] religion, hid in the Amano-Iwato cave following a conflict with her brother, the storm god [[Susanoo]]. When Amaterasu retreated to the cave, she took the sun with her, causing the world to be engulfed in darkness.

Distressed by the eternal darkness, the other gods executed a plan to lure Amaterasu out of the cave. They gathered in front of the cave, making merry and creating a lot of noise. The goddess [[Ame-no-Uzume]] performed a comedic dance that made the other gods laugh uproariously. Intrigued by the commotion, Amaterasu opened the cave slightly to see what was happening. Seeing this, one of the gods grabbed her and pulled her out of the cave, and another god put a sacred rope across the entrance of the cave so she could not return. Thus, light returned to the world.

The Amano-Iwato myth is a key story in the Shinto religion and is symbolic of various themes such as renewal, the victory of good over evil, and the importance of communal efforts.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> In the myth of Amano-Iwato, an important figure named [[Omoikane]] also plays a significant role. Omoikane is a deity of wisdom and intelligence in Shinto religion. He is known for his ability to "think fast" or provide insightful solutions to difficult problems, and his name roughly translates to "God of thinking" in English.

During the time when Amaterasu hid in the Amano-Iwato cave and the world was plunged into darkness, it was Omoinokane who devised the plan to lure her out. Recognizing the importance of bringing light back to the world, Omoinokane suggested gathering the other gods in front of the cave and creating a lot of noise and merriment, which included the dance by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume. His plan worked, and when Amaterasu opened the cave slightly out of curiosity, the gods were able to pull her out, bringing light back to the world.

Omoinokane's role in this story highlights the value of wisdom and strategic thinking in overcoming challenges. His intelligent plan not only restored light to the world but also demonstrated the power of unity and collective action among the gods. It reinforces the themes of good triumphing over evil, the importance of community, and the power of intellect and strategy.
