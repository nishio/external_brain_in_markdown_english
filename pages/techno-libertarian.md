### Techno-libertarian definition
.
Techno-libertarian refers to those who seek to maximize individual [[freedom]] and rights and minimize the influence of government and [[centralized power]] through the use of rapidly evolving technology, or to the very idea itself. Libertarianism is characterized by the development of the libertarian concept of "freedom first, minimizing government interference" in conjunction with technology, particularly [[Internet]] and [[cryptography]].
    - [[small government]]

# Positive feedback
.
1.### Innovation Promotion
.
- A free environment and competition speed innovation and stimulate the market.
- Less centralized control and regulation will make it easier to experiment more boldly and take on new projects.
2.### Respect for individual rights
.
- They dislike the oversight and regulation of centralized organizations and seek to protect expression, privacy, and property rights by creating an environment where individuals can obtain information and services directly through the use of technology.
3.### Increased autonomy
.
- By using blockchain and decentralized services, we aim to create a world where individuals and communities can operate autonomously, building systems that do not depend on governments or large corporations.

# Critical Opinion
1.### Growing inequality
.
- Reducing regulations will create freer competition, but may increase inequality as a few people and firms that already have the resources and knowledge will gain an increasing advantage.
2.### Lack of social responsibility
.
- The prioritization of individual freedom weakens mechanisms to deal with environmental problems, working conditions, and other risks borne by society as a whole.
- Also, communal perspectives, such as the development of [[public goods (i.e., goods or services such as parks or highways)]], tend to fade away.
3.### concern about unregulated chaos
.
- Some have pointed out that complete freedom of information and services will lead to growing problems such as rampant [[fake news]] and [[cybercrime]], which will eventually lead to a movement for a new order and rules.

### Summary
.
Technolibertarianism represents a view of technology that emphasizes decentralization, free competition, and individual autonomy, but it is an ideology that also raises concerns about issues such as social inequality and disregard for the public good in the process of its realization. How to strike a balance between technological innovation and social responsibility is an important issue for the future.
