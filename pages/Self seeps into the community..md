<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of discussions have been held in the past about how [[the boundary between self and others]] is not only an [[individual]] boundary, but also a [[holon]]-like [[overlapping set]] that [[considers a social group as self]]?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>Briefly, "[[Boundaries of the self]]" are discussed in many fields as multi-layered "[[overlapping]]" not only individuals, but also relationships, groups, institutions, and ecosystems. We will quickly map just the major genealogies.
- Systems theory/Holon
    - [[Arthur Koestler]] proposed "holon" and "[[holarchy]]" as "something that is both whole and part. Later [[Ken Wilber]] extended the theory to the social and cultural level. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_%28philosophy%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Social psychology: individual ⇄ relationship ⇄ group variable self
    - IOS scale ([[Inclusion of Other in the Self]]), which measures the overlap between others and oneself in terms of overlapping circles. There is also a group version (IIS), which measures the degree of "inclusion of the inner group within oneself". ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8168758/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Social identity theory/self-categorization theory: [[self-representation]] switches to "[[I→we]]" depending on the situation, and [[the group becomes "self"]]. ([SAGE Knowledge](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/processes/chpt/social-identity-theory?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - [[Social Identity Complexity]]: the integration of multiple group affiliations into the self as "overlap". ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/s15327957pspr0602_01?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - [[Identity Fusion]]: intense unification where the boundaries between self and group nearly dissolve. ([UT Psychology Lab](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/swann/files/2016/03/Gomez-et-al-2011_JPSP.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Anthropology: [[divisible]] (divisible) personality
    - [[dividual]] /  [[offshoot (plants; often the of grass family)]] <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Marilyn Strathern and Marriott present the "individual/partible person" concept, which views the person as an allocation of relationships. The individual is "allocated" to others and to the group from the beginning. ([Pirate Care Syllabus [https://syllabus.pirate.care/_preview/library/Marilyn%20Strathern/The%20gender%20of%20the%20gift_%20problems%](https://syllabus.pirate.care/_preview/library/Marilyn%20Strathern/The%20gender%20of%20the%20gift_%20problems%) 20with%20women%20and%20problems%20with%20society%20in%20Melanesia%20%20%28468%29/The%20gender%20of%20the%20gift_%20problems%20with%20 wome%20-%20Marilyn%20Strathern.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- Japanese Philosophy and Ethics: [[The self as 〈in-between〉]].
    - [[Watsuji Tetsuro]]'s "[[aida-gara]]" captures human existence as a relationship that precedes the dichotomy between the individual and society.
    - Kitaro Nishida's "[[Location]] (basho)" locates the self in a "place" that transcends subject-object separation. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-philosophy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Sociological Classics
    - [[Mead]]'s "[[generalized other]]" is the idea that [[communal attitudes give]] the unity of the self.
        - The [[collective consciousness]] of [[Durkheim]] is a shared norm that binds its members from within. ([Brock University](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs2/mindself/Mead_1934_20.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Social Philosophy/Law: Collective Intentionality and Group Agency
    - [[Collective intentionality]] ([[shared intention]], belief) and the argument that "[[a]] group can be its own agent" by [[decision design]] (List & Pettit). The legal doctrine of juridical personality is also historically grounded. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-intentionality/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Cognitive Science: Expanding and Distributed Mind
    - [Distributed cognition (human + tools + others as one cognitive system) and Extended Mind (mind "outside" tools and environment). Boundaries go outside the skin. ([MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262581462/cognition-in-the-wild/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
        - The context in which I originally started thinking about this was[[「自分」が「自分の周囲のコミュニティ」にはみ出す]]と表現するのがしっくりくるものだった<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Made brief: "Self seeps into the community."
                    - [[self]] [[seeps]] into [[Community]]
- Biology: Holobiont (host + symbiotic microorganism)
    - In immunology and evolution, the view that "individual = community (holobiont)" has become common due to hologenome theory and other factors. The boundary of an individual is defined by a symbiotic system. ([BioMed Central](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0457-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Political Thought: Imagined Communities
    - [[Anderson]] describes the nation-state as an "Imaginary Community" sustained by the imagination of its members. A classic that shows the conditions under which a huge group becomes a "we. ([Encyclopedia Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Imagined-Communities-Reflections-on-the-Origins-and-Spread-of-Nationalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Imagined-Communities-Reflections-on-the-Origins-and-Spread-of-Nationalism) utm_source=chatgpt.com])

Typical example of a direct hit on "overlap."
    - IOS/IIS overlap circle = subjective weighing of "overlap of self and others". ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8168758/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Social Identity Complexity = Structuring overlapping affiliations. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/s15327957pspr0602_01?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Identity Fusion = dissolution of boundaries (extreme overlap). ([UT Psychology Lab](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/swann/files/2016/03/Gomez-et-al-2011_JPSP.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
