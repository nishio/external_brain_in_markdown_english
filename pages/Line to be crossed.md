First appearance [[How to come up with good ideas]].

The intention is not to meddle in other people's livelihoods, but to verbalize my personal values for myself so that I don't get lost.
Don't do a job where the line to be crossed is 60 points.
- The mentality of aiming for 90+ points and the mentality of aiming for 60+ points are polar opposites
- If you are doing the latter, you can't do the former.
- Do not deal with customers who demand "must succeed."
    - To achieve "must succeed," we must lower the hurdles to be crossed.
    - The questions will be set to aim for a score of 60 or higher.
- Work that continues to produce things that are not very good, but not very bad, is sterile.
