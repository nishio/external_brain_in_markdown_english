>  [[Sunflower Student Movement]] (Chinese: [[太陽花學運]], [[318學運]]) is a social movement that began on March 18, 2014, when students and citizens of the Republic of China (Taiwan) occupied the [[Legislative Yuan]] (the Japanese equivalent of the Diet building).
> Because it began on March 18, it was initially called the 318 School Unions and Occupy Parliament case in the Taiwanese media. Other names for the movement include the 318 Youth Occupation Legislative Yuan, the Sunflower Student Movement, the Sunflower Student Movement, and the 318 Civics Movement. Currently, the most common name for the movement is the Sunflower Student Movement.

> "Sunflower Student Movement," which became involved in politics for the first time
> My first direct involvement with politics was the Sunflower Student Movement in March 2014, just before I turned 33.
> ... The young people who occupied the Legislative Yuan will surely have their own arguments... The students, as well as the more than 20 private organizations supporting them outside the Legislative Yuan, had their own arguments, and every argument was compelling.
>  So, I supported the students' movement by [[live transmission]] the scene inside the Legislative Yuan, where they were holed up, on the Internet with members of [[gov-zero]] (a private Taiwanese organization that pursues open government and demands thorough information disclosure and transparency from the government). We supported the students' movement by [[live transmission]] over the Internet. We connected the inside and outside of the Legislative Yuan via live camera so that 20 private organizations could discuss human rights, labor, environmental issues, and so on.
>  Then, in three weeks, we put together four demands and proposed them to the chairman of the Legislative Yuan. Then, the then chairman of the Legislative Assembly agreed that the four demands were reasonable, and he agreed to all of them.
>  Through this experience, the people of Taiwan realized that "[[demonstrations are]] not an act of pressure or vandalism, but an act of showing that many people have different opinions," and this led to more opportunities for dialogue between the public and private sectors. This led to more opportunities for dialogue between the public and private sectors, and everyone came to realize that "[[politics]] can only move forward with the participation of the people.

> The Sunflower Movement is acting as a major social driving force in the current administration. On the other hand, in Japan, anti-government protests have an image of being strongly ideological, and it is difficult for them to gain broad public support. What are the differences in social movements between Japan and Taiwan?
>  [[Tan]] What makes the Sunflower Movement unique is that it was not a demonstration to protest for the sake of opposition. If anything, it was a demonstration to "model case" and "set an example".
- [[Demonstration by example]].

> Tanaka: This is the Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan, right?
>  Audrey: Yes, that's right. The picture, roughly speaking, is of me in the occupied parliament.
>  Tanaka: What?　You were inside?
>  Audrey: Yes, I was inside for a while, and if you check Twitter, you can see the whole process of me bringing a very long C85 or C86 cable, about 350 meters, inside. We didn't have broadband in the parliament. Broadband, of course, is a human right, so I had to support everybody [[laughs]].
    - [[Broadband is a human right]]
