- Let's see if I can write an explicit opinion on this.
    - Electoral districts should not be abolished. This is because even in the digital age, people have physical bodies and have interests based on their physical location. Electoral districts based on "location" in a dimension different from geographic location should be added.

I voted for all of them.

I see.
- Opinions can be expressed through "yes/no" voting, which is a lower psychological hurdle than expressing opinions in writing.
- Since this statement of opinion can be regarded as a vector, it can be visualized by means of an appropriate two-dimensional embedding method.
- I wonder if they do clustering as well.
    - By selecting different clusters, it is possible to see "which issues are being disagreed upon".
    - This encourages detailing one's thoughts.
