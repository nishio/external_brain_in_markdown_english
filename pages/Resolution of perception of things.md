- I have also written [[Resolution of reality]], [[Cognitive Resolution]], etc.

To sum up.
- Things in the world outside of yourself ([[reality]]), not in your mind.
- How to recognize it ([[recognition]])
- This may be finely discriminated or roughly discriminated ([[resolution (e.g. display, dpi)]]).
