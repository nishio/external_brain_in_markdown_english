[[narrative continuity]].
- Organizations are more likely to accept proposals that ride on "[[an]] ongoing story."
    - A plot that "deepens a story that is already running" rather than being new lowers the [[cost of empathy]].

Utilization of [Institutional Inertia
- Once the framework is approved, inertia sets in as internal norms and procedures do not need to be rewound.
- Bringing the proposal in line with that [[inertia]] will reduce the [[friction]] of the review.

[[Resource relabeling]]
- When existing resources such as budget, personnel, and brand are "renamed" and presented, it is perceived as a reallocation rather than an additional investment.
- As a result, decisions are made faster.

Identification of evaluation metrics
- If the results are discussed along the same axes as the existing project's indicators, a new evaluation framework will not be needed and the decision-making process will be shortened.

Embedded risk perception
- While "new" triggers risk verification, "extension" is more likely to be considered within the scope of existing risk. Therefore, the hurdle for additional judgment is lowered.

summary
- By creating a "[[continuous]]" rather than an "addition" to the existing structure, [[Organizational Inertia]] can be brought on board, and the cost of explanation and persuasion can be minimized. and persuasion costs can be minimized.
