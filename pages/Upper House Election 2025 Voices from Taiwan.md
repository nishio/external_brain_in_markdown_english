title: "Upper House Election 2025 Voices from Taiwan"

translation
> The results of Japan's House of Councillors election have been announced, with the new party "Mirai Platoon" (Team Mirai) winning at least one seat, confirming the election of party leader Takahiro Anno (Takahiro Anno)!
>  It was more moving than watching Taiwan's own elections, so much so that I am brazenly posting a two-shot (and thumbs-up pose) that I took earlier in the year.
>  The 34-year-old new member of the House of Councillors, Yasuno, is a science fiction writer and engineer who last year challenged the Tokyo gubernatorial election and came in fifth place with 150,000 votes. His campaign platform, "2030 Digital Democracy," was highly acclaimed.
>  Collecting a large number of opinions through various channels such as SMS, Twitter, and 24-hour VTubers, and organizing them into an election white paper using deliberation tools - they call this series of processes "[[broad listening]]" (derived from the "simultaneous multiple listening" of [[Prince Shotoku]], and made easier in the age of AI). This process is what they call "[[broadening]].
>  Many friends joined in the action, and Mr. Yasuno was later welcomed into the GovTech team in Tokyo to work on future-oriented government tech projects. This is the extent of what I have been following so far.
>  In the past six months, Mr. Anno's example has been so singular and inspiring that it is always introduced in lectures on AI and deliberation. Last month I also attended a symposium at the STS Research Institute of Yang-Ming Jiao Tong University, and I would like to thank Prof. Fan Xiaofang.
>  I did not expect that within a few months "Mirai Platoon" would officially become a political party, and that it would surely gain one seat in the Upper House on its first try. There is still a slight possibility of a second seat.
>  Interestingly, while the Japanese election has focused on the "[[exclusion]]" agenda, the Mirai Platoon aims to bridge the gap between different claims with its "[[do not stir up trouble]].
>  In contrast, [[political party in power]] calling for "Japanese first" also grew rapidly.
>  At a time when election results around the world are simultaneously shifting to the extreme right and to the extreme left, Future Platoon's breakthrough is an extremely valuable signal.
>  How will Mr. Yasuno sublimate the "will of the people" into "policy" in the Diet - a difficult task, but one that I am very much looking forward to.
>  Congratulations indeed!
