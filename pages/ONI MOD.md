- Falling Sand
    - Collapsed sand is also subject to excavation.
- Build Over Plants
    - Can direct construction where plants are growing, plants are pulled out.
- Bigger Capacity
    - Capacity adjustment of hangars, etc.
    - Materials to build the hangar will soon be plentiful.
    - I'd rather solve this problem with a mod than with a bunch of side-by-side solutions.
- Aquatic Farm
    - Farm tile that absorbs ambient water
    - Not much use for it now.
    - Cultivated in temperature-controlled ponds
- GasOverlay
    - easy to see
- Blueprints
    - Construction instructions can be copied and pasted when you want to build another one of what you have constructed.
    - Can be named, saved and reused.
- DGSM - Duplicants Generation Settings Manager // by @Ony 👾
    - Can interfere with initial duplicant and print pod behavior
- Favorite Resources // by @Ony 👾
    - Improved resource display
- Self-sealing Airlocks
    - It's also airtight when the airlock is open.
    - Airtight release when open
    - Liquid airlock is troublesome.
- Bigger Camera Zoom Out
    - Zoom in all the way
- Longer Bridges
    - Long bridge across two pipes
- Buildable AETN
    - Anti-entropy device can be built.
- Travel tube crossing wall and ladder
    - Tubes can intersect with ladders
- No Drop // by @Ony 👾
    - Don't drop things.
- ChainedDeconstruction
    - Dismantle contiguous items together.
- Bigger Building Menu
    - Make menus larger to reduce scrolling
- Speed Control
    - I always play it 10x faster.
- Half Door
    - 1 square door
- Deconstructable POI Props
    - Demolish ruins and stuff.
    - demon who obstructs sentient beings from maintaining moral behaviour
- Fluid Shipping
    - Equipment that allows liquid tanks to be carried and then placed directly into pipes
- Smart Mop // by @Ony 👾
    - Cumbersome to select a range of mopping.
    - Mop up a continuous stream of liquids with a single click
- Advanced Electrolyzer
    - Hydrogen and oxygen enter the pipe separately.
    - A mechanism for separation without filters can now be made in Sola, and it's a pain to make.
        - [/OxygenNotIncluded/SPOM](https://scrapbox.io/OxygenNotIncluded/SPOM)
    - PH2O can be converted to PO2, which can also replace the evaporator.
- Buildable Natural Tile
    - Can install soil blocks, etc.
    - Baking argae is a hassle.
    - The same amount of resources are required, so the resources cannot be increased.
- Butcher & Fishing Stations
    - Equipment to turn surplus organisms into meat
- Double Sweeper Range
    - Extend the scope and increase the room for automation
- Compact Info Cards
    - Display Improvement
- Efficient Supply
    - I wonder what it's called.
- Crack Reacher
    - Extend the scope of construction, etc.
- Cooling Element
    - Not tried yet, a device that uses electricity to cool (thermal destruction)
    - We can now do active cooling with boilers, and we've built a number of them, and it's getting tedious.
- Pliers
    - I can chop the pipe.
    - Pipes can be disconnected immediately instead of waiting for a dismantling instruction.
- Black Hole Garbage Disposal
    - Throw away things you don't need (and don't use yet)
    - If they start doing natural gas distillation or something and make sulfur or something that has zero use, I'd be tempted to dump it.
    - If I dump the regolith, will the machine run lighter?
    - The solution for infinite liquid tanks is airlock doors and airflow tiles, while infinite gas tanks are saunas.
    - Infinite gas tanks have a well-known solution of liquid to vent, but it's a pain, so I only use saunas these days.
- Piped output
    - Recently added
    - Convert all environmental emission type facilities to pipe output type
        - It is upwardly compatible with Advanced Electrolyzer.
    - Sealing the equipment and pumping it will solve the problem, when that hassle is too much.
- Thermal Isolation Door
    - Doors to be insulated
    - If you stack three doors on top of each other and only raise the middle one, you can insulate it by creating a vacuum, but when that's too much trouble.
- Advanced Generators 2
    - A generator that generates electricity by absorbing ambient heat.
    - Operating temperatures range from 10 to 55 degrees Celsius, so it is not a replacement for boilers
    - Good for compactly cooling a living area.
    - If you have a type of farm where 10 degrees Celsius is the optimum temperature, it is easy to maintain the optimum temperature just by placing this on the farm.
- Simpler Pip Plant Rule
    - Simplify Pip's seeding rules.
    - Leave it alone and plant it just fine.
    - It's a pain in the ass to control if you try hard enough with a ladder or something.
- Power Tweaks
    - Power-related balancing
    - I don't think I need this one anymore.
- Claustrophobia - Stuck Duplicant Alert
    - Alerts you when you're trapped.
    - Avoiding Unexpected Death

What I want now
I want a device that has all the SCPS PowerGrid distribution equipment in one piece, it's a pain to make every time.

In retrospect, the "trial-and-error stage of figuring out how to do something" is fun, but once it stabilizes, I find myself saying, "I hate doing work that I know how to do.
