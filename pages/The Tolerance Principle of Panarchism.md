title: "The Tolerance Principle of Panarchism"
---

[[Panarchy]].

> Tolerance is the attitude that one's ideals should be practiced "at their own expense and risk" only among those who agree with them, and that one should not force others who disagree with one's ideals to do so, and should not interfere with what they do. It is an attitude of not forcing others who disagree with us to do so, and not interfering with their actions at all. By "tolerating" one another, people can break free from the uniformity of coercion imposed by the territorial state that has dominated until now, and individual freedoms and rights can be protected to the fullest extent possible.
>  The opposite concept to tolerance is "intolerance," Zube's principle of "tolerance for the tolerant and intolerance for the intolerant" and the possibility of coercive force against the intolerant. Such ideas strongly reflect Zube's personal tendencies as an individualistic anarchist and free-market libertarian, justifying anarchistic secession, denying the coercive redistributive function of the state, and endorsing free-market self-responsibility.

It is [[Atlas shrugs]] to take a non-interventionist stance without forcing ideals on those who do not agree with them, the same as [[living in hiding in the mountains]].
