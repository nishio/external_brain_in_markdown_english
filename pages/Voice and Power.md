### Digest of Research Notes
.

- Combining insights from [[Diary 2023-08-30]] and [[will to power]], we discussed factors that influence human behavior and thinking.

There is a common perception of power, especially among those who believe that shouting about "those without power" shouting "give me power," attracts attention and is effective in solving problems, and those who have power but are considered "those without power" should raise their voices. However, those who have power but are regarded as "powerless ones" believe that they should demonstrate their competence instead of raising their voices. This is because "raising one's voice" is not a validation of power because even "those without power" can do so.

He also offered the perspective that public opinion may have changed because those who were silent changed their minds to "speaking up might change things for the better.

We also discussed "the power of belief" and "the power of disbelief." While we should not believe that society is rationally designed, we can believe that there is always a solution to a problem that many ordinary people are solving.

He stated that it is hard to ignore people's slander and respond with silence. Further research is needed to understand how these factors interact to shape human behavior and thinking.

### questions and comments
.

- As for the "powerless" yelling "give me power," how well has that worked?
- How should we maintain a balance between "the power to believe" and "the power not to believe?"
- How can we develop the "ability to go through the motions" of ignoring people's slander?
- Are there specific examples of how these factors affect human behavior and thinking?

The above questions need to be considered in more depth.

Voice and Power: The Factors Behind Human Behavior and Thought

power, especially about the "powerless" crying out "give me power!"
- There is a common understanding between those who believe that shouting attracts attention and is effective in solving problems and those who have power but are considered "powerless" that they should speak up.
    - This is a little different.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Those who have power but are considered "powerless" should show their ability instead of raising their voices
        - Because "speaking up" is not a validation of power because even "powerless ones" can do it.
- Signals are needed to cut off those who are silent.
    - I don't know if it's necessary, I think it serves as a signal.

- [[Speaking up could change things for the better.]]
- The viewpoint that public opinion may have changed because those who were silent changed to "speaking up might change things for the better".

- [[The Power to Move People]]
- Pointing out that this force does not have a good name.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

We also discussed "the power of belief" and "the power of disbelief." While we should not believe that society is rationally designed, we can believe that there is always a solution to a problem that many ordinary people are solving.

- [[through power]]
- It is hard to ignore people's slander and respond with silence.
- The same could be said for "cynicism."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

We have gained a deep understanding of the elements that influence human behavior and thinking. Further research is needed to understand how these elements interact to shape human behavior and thinking.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

Power, especially the "powerless ones" shouting "give me power," was discussed. There is a common perception among those who believe that shouting attracts attention and is effective in solving problems and those who have power but are considered "powerless ones" that they should speak up. However, signals are needed to cut off those who remain silent.

Nishio's research note, "Speaking Up Might Change Things for the Better," is relevant to this discussion. The viewpoint that public opinion may have changed because those who were silent have changed to "speaking up may change things for the better" provides a new perspective for our research.

He also discussed the "power to move people. It is important to name this force; Nishio's note on the "power to move people" is closely related to this discussion.

He also discussed the "power to believe" and the "power not to believe. Nishio's note on "The Power to Believe and the Power Not to Believe" complements this discussion.

Finally, we discussed the "power of throughness". It is hard to ignore a person's slander and respond with silence; Nishio's note on the "power of throughness" is consistent with this consideration.

These considerations have provided a deep understanding of the elements that influence human behavior and thinking, including power, voice, power to move people, power to believe and not to believe, and power through and through. Further research is needed to understand how these elements interact to shape human behavior and thinking.
