        - For when talking about unexplored topics, [[My Relationship with Unexplored]].
    - ([[pluralitybook]]) Hello everyone! My name is NISHIO Hirokazu. I serve as a researcher at Cybozu, a company creating software that enhance teamwork. Additionally, I am a board member of the Mitou Foundation, where we support ambitious student IT projects in Japan.
        - One of my contributions was translating the keynote speech for Plurality Tokyo, delivered by Audrey Tang, into Japanese. I'm interested in "broad listening" – I feel it as a form of human augmentation that paves the way for improved mutual-understanding and decision-making at all levels (national, communal, or organizational.)
        - I feel this translation project is an opportunity to bridge gaps and foster mutual understanding across linguistic boundaries. This sentiment aligns with the "PLURAL THINKING" concept articulated in "WHY I AM A PLURALIST" by Glen Weyl(2022)
    - (to [[mashbean]]) I'm a researcher in Cybozu, whose philosophy is "[[Creating a fulfilling society of group cooperation]]".
        - Taka invited me to Plurality Tokyo last year, where I first learned about Plurality. I believe Plurality is an important concept, so I'm working on a Japanese translation project for it.

2011 Special Issue: Fundamentals of Language Design
It is not about individual languages, but about understanding various concepts better by knowing the design philosophy of the language (what it was created for). If you want to read the book, I recommend buying the compilation which contains PDF files of all the past editions.
