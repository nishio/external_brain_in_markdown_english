title: "If you're not motivated, you're not motivated to do the things that motivate you."
---

- When [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]] doesn't appear, you can [[walk]].

Sometimes you can "motivate" yourself to take an escapist walk if you just don't have the motivation for a specific task.
- So sometimes "just take a walk" works.

But when I'm generally unmotivated, I don't have the "motivation" to take a walk.



memo
- A "walk" is a big task
    - I'm going for a walk now, I decide.
    - step out from under the covers
    - change one's clothes
    - Decide where to go
    - High decision-making costs
    - Winter is cold
        - with physical pain
    - [[Phototherapy Light]]
    - [[hood worn by soldiers, students, etc. (e.g. during school or work)]]
