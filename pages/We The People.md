Just a quick point 👇.
- What are you talking about?
    - We The People" is a national dialogue project promoted by Jigsaw and the Napolitan Institute within Google. The first theme was "Freedom and Equality". Using the latest Gemini, an attempt to analyze and visualize participants' voices to draw points of agreement/differences. Continuing to be held for next year's [[250th anniversary of the founding of the United States]]. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))

- 3 rounds of 3
    1. individual expression: AI digs deeper with additional individually optimized questions for free-text descriptions (tone is adjusted to be like "a friend in the neighborhood"). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))
    2. collective reflection: interactive exploration and evaluation of Round 1 summary opinions (simple lists are preferred over complex visualizations). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))
    3. verification: AI generates declarative statements that are as representative as possible of diverse positions, participants evaluate representativeness → final report. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))

- Scale and Disclosure
    - 2,500+ people from all 435 precincts will be recruited by a third party (Rep Data), aiming for census-aligned representativeness. In addition to the results report, anonymized responses, AI follow-up questions, and even LLM prompts will be made available (wethepeople-250.org). ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))

- Pilot's Study (200 people)
    - Adjusting the tone of the AI is key: avoid researcher-like hardness and aggression, and improve on a friendly + curious base. Explicit transparency (AI intervention and purpose) is also key to trust. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))
    - Effectiveness: 94% of participants found the AI follow-up questions "useful"/ 3 out of 4 participants found it helped them better understand different perspectives. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))

- technical positioning
    - Sense-making" technology that captures "nuance" in real-time and shares insights as people say them, by developing real operational technology at a large town hall (Bowling Green, Kentucky, U.S.A.). technologies that capture "nuance" in real time and share insights as people say them. ([Medium](https://medium.com/jigsaw/we-the-peoples-first-national-conversation-freedom-and-equality-409dedfb02cd))

- Differences from traditional polls (summary)
    - Fixed questions + tabulation → Dialogic deep dive + reconstruction of collective knowledge
    - Results PDF → Opinion map/public data that allows participants to determine their location
    - One-time → Tune representative statements in iterative rounds

- Expectations and points to keep in mind (personal opinion)
    - The quality of representativeness sampling, AI follow-up question bias, and re-identification risk management through "openness" will determine success or failure. However, the emphasis on **quality of participant experience (tone design, transparency)** is a good implementation move.

If necessary, we will also create a technical arrangement comparing this method with Polis and the traditional [[Delphi method]].
