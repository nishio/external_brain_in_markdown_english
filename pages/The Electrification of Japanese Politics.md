> [kunlun8000](https://x.com/kunlun8000/status/1796626694071255354) In the last episode of Benipan (Part 2), I mentioned the words "[[Ghost in the Shell]]". I saw a few people here and there saying "[[Public Safety Section 9]] w-w" about it, so I'll explain it. I think you probably have only seen the anime, but in this case, "Public Security Section 9" is a mistake. It's not so much a mistake as a lack of information. #Ghost in the Shell #Masamune Shirow

> [kunlun8000](https://x.com/kunlun8000/status/1796627883802431577) This scene represents the Apple Chronology (Shiromasa World Chronology) "Ghost in the Shell can be done in Poseidon". It is also depicted in the original work with the "Ghost in the Shell" notation.
