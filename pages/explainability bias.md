explainability bias

It's been a day since the "heat is lost when explaining" chat.
- I'm taking an abrupt paid leave today, and I had a feeling this would lead to yesterday's story about "[[Description.]] and [[Heat]]"
- With no pressing deadlines and discretion, I am quite free to go about my normal business today.
- And yet, for some reason, I thought, "I feel like I should make [[a day with no plans]]," so I took the day off.
- Why it matters.
- → If you make it your business, you are free to do so, but it is customary to write down what you did at the end of the day.
- As a result, the dynamics of doing "what can be explained" come into play.
- If you take a break, you can do whatever you want, you can play Civ6, you can sleep, you can go to a sudden hot spring or Mt. Takao, you can watch Freelen, you can watch Demon's Plan.
- I don't go, but by putting myself in a position where I can go, I can observe myself by asking myself, "What do I do then?
