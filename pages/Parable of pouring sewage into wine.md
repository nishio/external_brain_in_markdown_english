title: "Parable of pouring sewage into wine"
---

> Pour a spoonful of wine into a barrelful of sewage, and you get a barrelful of sewage. Pour a spoonful of sewage into a barrelful of wine and you get a barrelful of sewage (Schopenhauer's [[entropy]] law)

    - When you mix [[difficult tasks]] and not difficult tasks and make them into a whole, they all become difficult tasks.
- They say things like, "This is a difficult problem," or "This problem cannot be solved with such a simple solution."
- That's because we think of the whole thing as one issue. You mix a "spoonful of sewage" with wine and say, "It's all sewage! I can't drink it!" The state of the world is saying.
- Let's split the problem. #problem-splitting #separation
- "That solution is not a solution!" but rather, "Is there any part of this solution that can be solved with this solution?" but rather, "Is there any part that can be solved by this solution?
- If you take away the parts that can be solved, the entire problem becomes smaller.
- This will make it easier to come up with the next solution.
- After removing the "solvable parts" and "drinkable wine" in this way, there may still be sewage that is inherently difficult to solve at the end. Only then should we consider how to treat the sewage.
- After mixing his own wine and sewage to make more sewage, he said, "There's so much sewage! What should I do with it? It's barbaric to say, "How do we dispose of it?

- [[Can't solve it that way -> what part of the problem can be solved this way?]]
#Parable
- [[problem-solving]]
