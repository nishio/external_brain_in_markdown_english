Instead of creating a page with a proper noun in the title first, we will only write a bean paper and then proceed to link to the keywords contained within the page as an adjunct.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/rashita/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon' height="19.5"/>In other words, you can imagine wikipedia. There, "statement" is never the title (although I haven't scrutinized all of them).
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Am I correct in my understanding that "instead of deciding on the page title first and then writing it, you should write a chunk of text and then use an important phrase from it as the title?"
