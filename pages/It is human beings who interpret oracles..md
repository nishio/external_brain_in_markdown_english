> The famous oracle of Delphi is the two oracles of Herodotus' "History" to Athens. During the Persian War, Athens first received an oracle that implied its destruction, and then it sent a messenger to Athens and received the following oracle.
>
>  But the daughter of Zeus, who keeps Aegis, gives to the Achaeans only a wooden wall as protection. - Herodotus, History.
>
>  Some interpreted this as burning the city of Athens and cowering in the Acropolis, which was then protected by a wooden wall, but Themistocles interpreted the "wooden wall" as referring to ships, had three-oared ships built, and defeated the Persian army at the Battle of Salamis

- Talk about how many interpretations there are when you pull [[metaphor]] ([[analogy]]) back to the actual problem.

- [[oracle]], [[tarot]], [[divination]], etc., are randomly selected, seemingly unrelated objects that are compared to "the [[foggy]] problem I am currently struggling with" and asked, "This is the answer to the problem, but in what sense is it the answer?" By asking oneself "What does it mean?", the [[notice]] system is brought to a new [[point of view]].
