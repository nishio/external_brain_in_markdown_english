> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1614803586961276928?s=20&t=NScRQ2R0q4mdUOr2B-j8iA): It's [[overgeneralization]] to touch [[ChatGPT]] and say "ChatGPT is [[Poor at logical thinking]]" but to say "[[AI]] is [weak (in) logical thinking". AI has been better at logical thinking than humans for decades. However, the [[natural language]] used by homo sapiens, which is not good at logical thinking, is ambiguous in interpretation, so I was speaking in [[artificial language]], which is strictly interpretable.

As time has progressed, our understanding of the natural language used by Homo sapiens has advanced, so that even Homo sapiens with poor logical thinking skills can converse with AI.
