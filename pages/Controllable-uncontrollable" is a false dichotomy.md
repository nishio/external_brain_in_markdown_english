title: 'Controllable/uncontrollable" is a false dichotomy'

>  [[I don't care what I can't control.]]

Something is "controllable/uncontrollable" in [[False dichotomy]].
Actually, it's "[[cost to control]] higher/lower."

All human decisions are not [[physical restraints]] and therefore "[[can]] be changed."
    - [[policy constraint]]  /  [[Rules are a product of past negotiations.]]

On the other hand, compared to "[[bird in hand]]", the cost of changing [[decision]] and acquiring a new bird is higher

So, you ignore the high-cost ones and use the low-cost ones that are available now, is that right?
