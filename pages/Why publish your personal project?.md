title: "Why publish your personal project?"
---

Interesting discussion point, I'll write about it later.
- Why use [/takker/public-private-project](https://scrapbox.io/takker/public-private-project)?

I felt like I wouldn't write if I said "I'll write later," so I'm going to write a bit of a mess.

- There are many different "reasons to do it," but none of them are "strong enough reasons to say 'you should do it' about everyone."
- I think the "doing" is pre-existing, and the reason for doing it is being created after the fact.

So I write this page not for the purpose of telling others why they should do it, but to help me understand myself.

- > Appeal that you are not slacking off
    - I don't have this feeling.
- > Throw a URL and we can share it.
    - This is strong.
    - In some cases, they're using it as a way to write a coherent amount of text and share it with others via URL.
        - Example: [https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1410449216397185025?s=21](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1410449216397185025?s=21)
        - But not all.
        - Some pages post their URLs to Twitter and Facebook after writing them, but not all.
    - I had something I wrote in a private project that was not mine alone that I wanted to share with others who were not there, and the system is running with automatic reprints to the public project once a day, but the most recent thing I wrote is not on the public side.
        - I gave up sharing the latest because it was too much trouble, but ideally I would have liked to be able to share it instantly.
        - The main reason I don't think [[Scrapbox private to public transfer]] will meet my needs?
        - If it's one page, can I just reprint it myself in PUBLIC?
            - If it's a situation where you're going to share it immediately with others, it's still okay because the target is usually one page.
            - Generally, I'll give you a number of pages of what I'm thinking about.
        - I get feedback on what I SHARE, and I have to make many additions and corrections.
            - It is tedious to repeatedly write in PRIVATE and reprint in PUBLIC
            - I'm going to make the mistake of editing public because it's a hassle and forgetting to reflect it in private.
- > I can look back at my writing and improve it.
        - [[Social Triggers]] gives us an opportunity to read back
    - You could write it down in a paper diary and look back at it every day for the last six months.
        - There's even a diary where the decade is on a single page.
        - I find it useful to compare my previous and current thinking and see what has changed and what has not
    - I'm not bean enough to keep a journal every day.
        - I don't even read it seriously and consistently.
        - I'd like some kind of read-back trigger for people like that.
        - A "past mention in an article" is a signal that the article remains worth mentioning over time.
        - The other [[This Day in the Past" on Facebook]] feature is also worthwhile as a trigger
- > I can receive stimuli that are out of my intended range.
- > [[Date last visited]] to find pages that may be of value to others.
    - [/rashitamemo/Scrapbox allows others to "koo" the cards](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/Scrapbox allows others to "koo" the cards).
    - I've never done this, I'll give it a try, but so far I'm not too moved by it.
        - This is a "get more social triggers" approach, and "see" is easier to gather information than "mention" because the hurdle for action is lower.
        - I'm not really interested in that information.
        - "What value is there in information that is viewed by an unspecified person with no output?"
        - This depends on the situation.
            - If your job is to write books for the general public, it is useful to know what an unspecified number of people who do not output
            - It's information that is hard to obtain because it's not output, and it's valuable to get it.
>  Be aware of your writing
- > I haven't thought about this.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/takker/icon' alt='takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It's a place to dump around what comes into your brain, not a place you want others to see.
- Sometimes I get my sentences in order, sometimes I don't.
    - [Future self is a stranger, so I'll get what I want my future self to read.
    - For example, giving a page a decent title means you want your future self to read it.
    - Specifically with this project, the "Nodes of Thought" series is an example of "not a proper title"
        - I don't need to read it to know, but I write down the keywords that seem to be related or important, like for example, I was chatting with people that day and various topics came up.

What came out over time
    - [[Fear of being lost]]
What came out further in time
    - [[Publish to protect your freedom to implement your ideas.]]
What came out over a year later
- from [/villagepump/Scrapbox text may be readable to LLM](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/Scrapbox text may be readable to LLM).
    - I suddenly remembered that the reason why I started writing my lessons learned and thoughts in a public forum is because when I was a college student [[Google search appears]], I became "a 'smart search' if I put it in a public forum"...
        - Back then, you still couldn't do a smart search if you remained private.
        - I wrote a series of articles to remind myself of what I had done in the past.

    - [[Public or private projects?]]
