What is difficult to do in the present world is accomplished by projecting it into another world, doing it there, and then returning to it.

Rotation is unwieldy in the Cartesian coordinate system, so it is converted to the polar coordinate system, rotated there, and then returned to the original coordinate system.

Fourier analysis can transform time series data (data in the time domain) into the frequency domain. For example, convolutional integration is simply multiplication in the frequency domain.

- In [[NMDA]], to resolve [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]], we ask "What does it look like?" to solve [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]], we map to the space of [[analogy]], look for a way to solve the conflict there, and then consider whether that solution will help us solve the conflict in the original space.
