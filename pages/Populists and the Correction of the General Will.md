Populists and the Correction of the General Will
> [satoruishido](https://x.com/satoruishido/status/1837017051157680220) I think the definition of [[populism]] is reasonably complete in political science. We are discussing it in a fluffy way without deciding how to use it >> Undercurrent of distrust of political parties: "I am not a [[populist]]" [[Shinji Ishimaru]] talks about the Koizumi-Hashimoto Theater/2 | Mainichi Newspapers
- [Undercurrent of distrust of political parties: "I am not a populist," Shinji Ishimaru says of Koizumi-Hashimoto theater / 2 | Mainichi Shimbun](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20240919/k00/00m/010/135000c)

> [satoruishido](https://x.com/satoruishido/status/1837021077199028494) Also, in current political science, populist is not a critical term. I often use [[Kas Mude's]] definition of "a weakly centered ideology that believes that society is ultimately divided into two homogeneous opposing camps, the 'untainted people' and the 'corrupt elite,' and that politics should be an expression of the people's [[the general will]], How about a slightly more nuanced view that the current political parties and politicians are corrupt and need to be replaced by politicians who embody the will of the people? There is no good or bad in this.
