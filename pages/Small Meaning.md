title: "Small Meaning"

An example of the value found in small meanings (from [[Philosophy of Sense]])

> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1823343177845424216) I just casually added it to a project I sometimes use to generate novels, and was surprised.
>  What's more, first of all, the "Kansai stage" can be used to express "3rd year students" (if it is designated as Kanto, it becomes "3rd year students").
>  I can also find some fireworks festivals in the Kansai area in August and from the "view from the riverside" area, I can get "Yodogawa Fireworks Festival" and "Meet at Umeda at 16:00".
>  I've never been to the Yodogawa Fireworks Festival, but from the location, it should not be unreasonable to meet at Umeda at 16:00 (although given the crowds, it may be too late to view the fireworks there).
