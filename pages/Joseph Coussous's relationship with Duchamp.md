[Joseph Kosuth and Marcel Duchamp are artists who shaped an important turning point in contemporary art, particularly in the context of [[conceptual art]]. Coussous was greatly influenced by Duchamp's ideas and work, which he further developed into his own artistic philosophy.

Duchamp's influence
- Ready-made inventions
    - In the 1910s, Duchamp invented the "readymade," a method of presenting ready-made objects as works of art. The famous "Fountain" (1917), for example, radically redefined the value and meaning of a work of art by presenting an everyday object (a urinal) as a work of art.
    - This approach raised the questions "What is art?" and "Where is the value of a work of art?" and created a direction that emphasizes ideas and concepts rather than the physical work itself.

- Emphasis on concepts
    - Duchamp emphasized "intellectual questioning" over "visual pleasure" in his art. His works often demanded a philosophical or intellectual response from the viewer.

The Development of Coussous
Joseph Coussous emerged as a central figure in conceptual art in the late 1960s, furthering Duchamp's ideas.

- conceptual art
    - Coussous argued that the essence of art lies not in the physical object but in the concepts and words it evokes.
    - His masterpiece, "[[One and Three Chairs]]" (1965), is a series of actual chairs, photographs of chairs, and definitions of chairs that question the relationship between the objects themselves, their concepts, and their language.

- Similarities with Duchamp
    - Both artists created works that transcended "[[the]] materiality of art.
    - Coussous was strongly influenced by the "[[work's]] ideaability" demonstrated by Duchamp's readymades, which he extended to language and philosophical speculation.

- A Philosophical Approach
    - Coussous was also influenced by the philosophy of language of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and explored the relationship between words and objects. This is an extension of Duchamp's attempt to interrogate the "meaning of [[objects]].

Differences between the two
- Duchamp deconstructed the tradition of "visual art," but it was only important to be critical in individual works.
- On the other hand, Coussous considered art itself to be an "act of language" and placed emphasis on the construction of a philosophical system.

Conclusion.
Joseph Coussous inherited Marcel Duchamp's innovative ideas, but explored the conceptual aspects of art more explicitly. It can be said that Coussous developed the question "What is art?" posed by Duchamp by "reconstructing the definition of art.
