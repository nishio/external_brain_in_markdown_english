Historically, higher education has been greatly changed by technological innovation. Typical examples include

- [[Printing Technology]] ([[Gutenberg]])
    - The spread of letterpress printing in the mid-15th century led to a large and inexpensive supply of books. With the development of texts in universities and other educational institutions, the systematic sharing and diffusion of knowledge spread rapidly.

    - [[the Industrial Revolution]] and [scientific laboratory facilities
    - New technologies emerged one after another during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and universities began to be equipped with laboratories and experimental facilities. This led to the development of empirical scientific research and specialized education, and strengthened the research function of universities.

- Use of broadcast media such as radio and television
    - In the early to mid-20th century, distance education began to be put to practical use with the advancement of broadcasting technology. In particular, television and radio courses expanded learning opportunities for people in areas where higher education was not available.

- Diffusion of Computers and the Internet
    - Online learning or [[e-learning]] has become common in higher education with the spread of personal computers and the Internet since the late 20th century. University lectures and libraries have become increasingly digitalized, diversifying the ways in which students learn.

- MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)
    - In the 2010s, major universities and educational platforms released large-scale online courses, making them available to anyone in the world for free or at low cost. Learning environments beyond the traditional university campus became widespread.

As these examples show, technological innovation has fundamentally changed the nature of higher education and the learning environment. It is expected that higher education will continue to change in flexible and diverse ways as new technologies emerge.

While it is easy to focus only on aspects that have "newly expanded" due to technological innovation, some have "declined" or disappeared. Some major examples are listed below.

- Original manuscripts and handwritten originals
    - Before the spread of Gutenberg's letterpress printing, learning in churches and monasteries relied primarily on manuscripts. With the advent of printing technology, manuscript culture shrank considerably, and mass copying work by hand fell into disuse.

- Paper-based information distribution
    - With the proliferation of the Internet and e-books, many universities are digitizing their library collections, and academic journals are also going online. For a long time in the past, only paper journals could be referenced, but publishers and publications that could not keep up with digitization went out of business or downsized.

- Distance learning courses for remote areas (old mail)
    - Prior to the rise of online classes, correspondence courses such as the Open University of Japan and mail-based assignment correction methods were the mainstream of distance education. In the process of shifting to lecture delivery via the Internet and video streaming, the needs for mail-based correspondence courses declined and the scale of operation shrank.

- One-way lecture style
    - Before the Internet, most of the time, faculty members spoke in a unidirectional manner in large lectures. However, as interactive online learning tools and active learning methods have become more common, the traditional "just listen to the lecture" method of education is losing relative ground.

- Specialized equipment and high-cost computing facilities
    - In the past, university laboratories required the use of large computers and specialized equipment, but as personal computers and cloud computing became more prevalent, the system centered on mainframes and dedicated servers with high maintenance and equipment costs has shrunk.

These examples of decline show that technological innovation did not necessarily allow existing educational methods and distribution formats to survive, and those that failed to adapt to change were rapidly reduced or eliminated.

In the following, we abstract the examples of "declining ones" listed in the previous section into several patterns and discuss them as they apply to the development of the Large Language Model (LLM).

1. abstracted pattern
- Elimination of methods with high physical and human costs
    - New technologies are rapidly replacing labor-intensive and time-consuming methods, such as manuscripts to printing and mailed distance learning to online.
- Reduction of one-way and limited information provision
    - One-way communication such as large-scale lectures and paper-only information dissemination have been replaced by new technologies that involve interactivity and immediacy.
- Migration from reliance on dedicated hardware to general-purpose systems
    - The high-cost environment of large computers and specialized equipment has been eclipsed by personal computers and cloud environments, moving toward a more popular and flexible system.
- Knowledge distribution that does not depend on a specific place or person
    - Printing technology and the Internet have made it more difficult to confine knowledge to specific organizations and regions, and have opened the door to learning more widely.

2. the impact of LLM development on higher education and the possibility of "decline
Based on the above patterns, the following "declines" or "replacements" could occur if LLMs are further developed.

- Decrease in value of standardized lectures and standard texts
    - The demand for homogeneous introductory and overview lectures and standard textbooks at universities may decline relatively because LLMs can explain general concepts and knowledge in an immediate and easy-to-understand manner.

- Reduction in human labor for correcting large numbers of assignments and reports → Change in teacher roles
    - By replacing some of the report correction and question-answering work done by faculty members with LLM, the amount of correction and administrative work that relies on human labor will be reduced. As a result, faculty members will be required to play more of a role in research guidance and high-level professional consulting.

- Decline of one-way learning content platforms
    - Once an interactive learning environment utilizing LLM is in place, traditional video-on-demand courses and paper text-centered platforms are likely to be outmatched and have fewer users.

- Reduction of specific administrative functions attached to universities
    - Parts of the services that are primarily information processing, such as admissions public relations, credit management, and academic book publishing, will be automated and externalized. Some of the services that universities have been providing on their own will easily be migrated to external platforms using LLM.

- Relative decline in authority of fixed specialties
    - As LLM integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines and provides instant summaries and analysis, the boundaries between disciplines based on "authority" and "tradition" will be shaken. Fields that do not utilize or apply new technologies will lose their presence, and their influence within the academic community may be relatively diminished.

summary
Historically, the emergence of new technologies has drastically changed the way higher education is provided and the form of knowledge distribution. As a result, "time-consuming and labor-intensive traditional methods," "one-directional and closed information provision," and "high-cost systems relying on specialized hardware" have rapidly declined.
In a future in which LLM is further evolved, based on a similar pattern, demand for some lecture formats and materials and traditional university functions may shrink. At the same time, faculty and universities will be required to evolve into roles that are more interactive, highly specialized, and creative.
