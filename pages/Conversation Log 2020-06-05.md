    - [Assistance in dividing long sentences into stickies
- I asked because I felt this would benefit [[Listening Chat System]] as well.
- awareness
    - Chat system asks questions, human answers them, divides the answers into sticky notes and displays them on a whiteboard [[Regroup]], human can move them around and organize them, chat system highlights keywords that are of interest
        - I never thought of this "chat system highlighting and generating [[joint warning]]" idea.
    - When chat systems start using whiteboards, it's more of a facilitator or consultant than a counselor.
    - What you get from your customers is not limited to money.
        - It is also useful to know "how the customer benefited from using this system.
    - Resources can also be used to prolong the life of software instead of using them to grow software.
        - Summary: [[Software Growth Period]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's talk.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I've implemented the ability to split long sentences for Regroup, and I think this would be beneficial to work with this chat system so we can talk and get our heads together.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Encourage verbalization by asking questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of verbalization is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I have a feeling that there might be a connection between the function of long division and the chat system's function of verbalization, but I haven't yet put into words what it is, and to put it into words
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NG
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is that chat system located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Here it is.

> I have a feeling that there might be a connection between the function of long division and the chat system's function of verbalization, but I haven't yet put into words what it is, and putting it into words
Where can I find this chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ah, I see, in that sense, the chat system comes first, and the answers elicited by the chat system questions are engraved in long division.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, a chat system that is not for fun but for serious business benefit.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that stiff?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NG
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of gachi is that gachi?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(Oh, I thought it wasn't suppressed.
NGKW
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about its business operations?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if we could generate some economic benefit.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about the benefit?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If the customer generates a profit, he or she will receive some of that profit as compensation, which will accelerate development.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its profit?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, harsh. There's no way of knowing for sure. If you have a paid plan for your customers' continued use and they continue to use it, you can assume that they are generating enough profit to keep paying.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of profit is that profit?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I initially envisioned monetary gain, but the concept is broader and includes customer satisfaction, intellectual enjoyment, etc.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is its profit?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know, customer's hand?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that client?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I know this is turning into something about customers and profits, but I'm not planning a commercial plan just yet, so it's just me and a limited number of beta testers for the time being. Also, I want to get back to the long division story I wanted to delve into.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Here's the question - I don't think you've done enough digging about long division.... I'm here because I see the value in the long division feature, and I'm here to dig into it...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its long division?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Right now it's just a long sentence because it's in the form of a chat, but it would be nice if this could be broken up and placed on the screen as a sticky note.
(It's harder to use on a phone, though.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between chat systems and long division?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Feedback from the chat system is now only in the form of a string of questions, but if it is broken up into long sentences and placed on the screen as stickies, humans can move them around to clear their minds, and the chat system can highlight the stickies when it calls attention to a particular keyword
(I see, I hadn't thought of this level of coordination yet.)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that chat system the same as long division? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(I just came up with the idea today to fix this same or different question because it's not a good idea.)
What is the relationship between this chat system and long division? There is another display system that is not a chat system, and we can flow data to that through the long division.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is that chat system like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>So far the chat system has been like talking verbally with a counselor. After incorporating the collaboration I just came up with, it's like a facilitator or consultant who organizes the discussion using a whiteboard.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to long division when its a chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's running as a local script now, but it should become a web API.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system during a long division?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This one needs more significant changes. I also wonder if it would be better to keep it in chatbot form. Maybe it would be better to integrate it into a whiteboard system? On the other hand, the current form is better than the whiteboard in terms of ease of use from a smartphone.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What's the difference between a chat system and a long division?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to use the chat system by itself, and I also want to use it connected to the whiteboard, so I need a system that is loosely coupled and can switch between the two, and if I want, I need a system that can be connected after the fact.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its chat system and profits?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In most commercial chat systems in the world, the company prepares data in advance, and the company's customers ask questions to the chat system and receive answers. In the current implementation, the data is deleted after one session, but if this data can be stored and shared throughout the company, more interesting things may happen. In other words, this is the business model of groupware.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the customer's relationship to that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Without customers, I would be the only user, and I would develop at a leisurely pace as a hobby. With customers, it becomes more about stability rather than adding new features. Personally, I don't think it's fun, but there are aspects of the project that accelerate when you have a client and payment.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is the customer the same as the chat system? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There is a difference. I dare say that if you look at a chat system as "an intellectual production system that includes people," the customer is a component of the chat system, though.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the customer when its a chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope using it will increase your intellectual productivity.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system when a customer
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Payments accelerate development.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between the chat system and the customer?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Trust?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is a chat system the same as a profit? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is not. Dare I say that profits are fodder for growing the chat system
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to profits when its a chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want my customers' business to be accelerated and the profits they earn to increase.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system when its profitable?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It would be nice if you could provide an example of "this idea was generated using this system" instead of just accelerating it with payment.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between the chat system and profits?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's positive feedback.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that feedback and the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Positive feedback drives growth.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that feedback the same as the chat system? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, I dare say it's the acceleration of growth.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its growth and the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You're right, growth is not a must for a chat system. Rather than adding more and more features, there is an option to use resources for longevity rather than growth, for example by refactoring or porting to a different code base.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does that chat system come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm making it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that me and the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Creating and using a chat system will improve my intellectual productivity.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that chat system the same as mine? Is it the same as mine?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In a sense, it's pretty close. I'm going to program the counseling skills I've learned, and then program my consulting skills again, and so on. It's like digitizing a subset of me.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system when its me?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are born and grow by me, right?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between that me and the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder. I don't know, maybe it's the hope that they will grow more and help me.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to me when the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>My intellectual productivity will improve.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its intellectual productivity and the chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Increased intellectual productivity improves the functionality of the chat system.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that chat system the same as intellectual productivity? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's an intellectual production system that combines a human and a chat system to produce intellectual production.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to intellectual productivity when its a chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What will be left when the combination of humans and the chat system has come to produce intellectually, and then the system improves the system more and more with its power, and then the system takes over the increasingly weakening of the humans, and then the humans die...
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the connection between that chat system and intellectual productivity?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Fusion.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system when it comes to intellectual productivity?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm getting tired of it by now, so bye-bye.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to feedback when in a chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>bye-bye
This system is rather exciting in the middle, but the end is not so good.
Today's interesting points are around "you should connect with the whiteboard system," "change from counselor to facilitator," and "use profits to prolong the life of the system."
