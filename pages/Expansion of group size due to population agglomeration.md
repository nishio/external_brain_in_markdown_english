> In this embodiment, group X uses device Z to increase its intellectual production capacity and develop a communication and cooperation system that promotes information sharing and cooperation. In addition, the larger the size of group X, the more intellectual resources it has, and the more technological innovation and knowledge propagation it can promote, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the group as a whole. In contrast, group Y has limited access to equipment Z, making it more difficult for it to increase its intellectual production capacity and competitiveness.
