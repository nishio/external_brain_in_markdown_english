title: "Negative and positive statements"
---

- Negative statements are easier
- The world is full of more negative statements.
- Negative statements make you look smarter #criticism
- I feel like I'm mounting by making negative comments.
- When people who say negative things get together, they only agree on opinions that deny the current situation and do not lead to new actions.
- Take a moment to say something positive.
- There is disagreement on positive improvement ideas.
- Discussions with people who have the mindset to take a negative and turn it into a positive with a single effort will improve the proposed improvements even more.
- It's more fun to think positive.


- There's also the trap of agreeing to affirm the status quo.
    - In those cases, there's value in saying something negative and destroying the equilibrium.
- No need to reject negative people.
    - It's like using dynamite to blow up a mine #even if
    - Let them explode more and more, and collect only the useful ones from the scattered ores in an unobtrusive manner.
