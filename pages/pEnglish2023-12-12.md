[[pEnglish]]

I'm looking at using LangChain's Chain feature.

Current Implementation
- [[Bashi]] translates into plain English.
- Virtual Personality [[Kai Harada]], who cannot read Japanese, reads and writes his thoughts.
- Translate that feedback into Japanese.

Kai's output was in English, and he thought that was fine in terms of increasing opportunities to read English
- but it [[cognitive load]] is high
    - Not a necessary load.
    - Unnecessary load should be minimized for the purpose, and here I am training to read English is an unnecessary load.
    - So I decided to translate it back into Japanese.
- Japanese that has been translated back into Japanese is quick to recognize mistakes.
    - > In summary, Hirokazu Nishio explores the relationship between different exchange styles and social status. He introduces new exchange styles associated with the exchange of digital goods and recognizes the influence of Yukio Mishima's perspective on this topic. However, he also recognizes the limitations of categorizing exchange activities into distinct styles.
        - I'm not talking about Yukio Mishima, okay?
    - > Yukio Mishima seems to find a greater meaning in Exchange Style D, so I will summarize his grand vision in a smaller way.
        - Japanese: `Guyoto Karatani seems to find more meaning in the exchange style D, so he puts the big ideas together in a small way`.
        - I feel like that's how you make mistakes at the translation stage.
        - I solved this by putting a correspondence in the prompt.
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>could apply the system that was put in place to prevent broken links.

I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
