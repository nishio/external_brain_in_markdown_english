title: "Twitter-like review tool"

- It would be nice to have a [[Twitter]]-like UI, where the data you pour into it flows through your timeline, you can like it, once you've seen it, it doesn't come up for a while, you can see as much content as you want with one thumb, you can see what you liked and replied to later, and it's easy to [[one-man brainstorming session]] and summarize it later in Scrapbox. brainstorming session], and easy to compile in Scrapbox afterwards.
- As for the data to be fed into the system, I initially envisioned "extracted data from the highlighted parts of a book," but it may be better to include the entire book. The sentences are lined up on the timeline, [[fragmented]] to an appropriate length, and can be read with a single thumb, and likes and comments can be made. You can stop reading when the train arrives at the station, and the next time you open the timeline, you will be able to continue reading from the beginning of the timeline, thanks to the mechanism of "once-seen things are not displayed for a while".
    - I can strongly promote [[Incremental Reading]].
    - You can "like" something on the train or in an elevator in a small window of time, and then later reprint it to Scrapbox on your PC.
