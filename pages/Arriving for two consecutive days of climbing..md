Arriving for two consecutive days of climbing.
- It was a very good learning experience.
- Climbing and descending mountain trails with a sore knee accelerates the learning iteration with [[Fail-fast]] because every movement that strains the knee immediately triggers a pain alert.
    - Sense of using the stock to stabilize and shift the center of gravity forward
    - The sensation of seeing a step that is too large to lift a normal foot and expecting severe pain, and then finding a path that can be climbed by a combination of small steps and carving it up.
        - This is similar to bouldering.
        - The first thing to recognize is, "I can't reach this position."
    - How to stabilize with stock on the way down
        - This one broke because I put too much weight on the cane before I was fully proficient.
            - Too much weight is not good, maybe in the long run the upper arm will not be able to bear it.
        - On the second day, I was just holding the branch from the side, so adjusting the length was easy, and this allowed me to experience the difference in the appropriate length for different situations.
            - Short climbs, long descents.
            - But the climbing and descending is so varied that I'm not sure how to go about it with an adjustable-length type of stock.
