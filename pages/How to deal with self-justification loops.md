Signs of a self-justifying loop
- Habit of replacing evaluation indicators after failure ([[goal post moving]]).
    - Phrases without [[falsifiability]] (e.g., "It's really working, but I don't see it yet").
How to deal with self-justification loops
- Pre-fixed: The evaluation period, scope, and indicators (KPIs) are determined ahead of time and not moved until later.
- Rejection condition: pre-determined numerical disqualification line (e.g., if the error >25 pts in 4 weeks, it is discontinued).
- Calibration by prediction: Produce a prediction with probability for each interpretation and periodically grade the accuracy with [[Brier]], etc.
- [[reverse question]] check: "If this interpretation is wrong, what are the first signs that it appears?" as a monitoring indicator.
- Preserving alternatives: mainstay interpretation + alternative hypotheses for comparison run side by side and rebased quarterly.
