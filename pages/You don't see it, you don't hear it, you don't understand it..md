title: "You don't see it, you don't hear it, you don't understand it."

- [[Gospel of Matthew 13]]
> 13 That is why I speak to them in parables. For they see and do not see, they hear and do not hear, and they do not understand.
>  14 Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled by them.
> "You hear, but you never understand,
>  I will see it, but I will never admit it.
> 15 The hearts of this people are dulled,
>  My ears are deaf,
>  My eyes closed.
>  Thus, they do not see with their eyes,
>  Without hearing it by ear,
>  He does not understand with his heart and does not repent.
>  I will not heal them."
