Regroup Release Notes 5/11/2021
- Reversed the direction of screen movement with the cursor keys.
- About the overall display with the space key
    - Bug fixed.
    - The display has been made one size smaller so that the content does not stick to the edge of the screen.
    - When the space key is pressed in the "Overall" view, the zoom in is now at the mouse cursor position instead of at the center of the screen.
        - This allows you to go back and forth between "Overall view" and "Zoom in on the area you want to focus on" using only the space key, without using the cursor keys!
