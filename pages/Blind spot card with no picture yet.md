- A [[blind spot card]] proposal that does not yet have a picture.
I'm not sure if I should write it all together or break it up into one page at a time, but I wrote it all together anyway.

1002:  [[Shift the center of rotation]]

1003:  [[innovation]]

- [[Schumpeter's definition of innovation]]

1004:  [[pulse width modulation]]

1005:  [[fuzzy set]]

1007:  [[grading by zero]]

1008:  [[probability resonance]]

1008: About that X [[Is there anything else?]]

One of Clean Language's Five Basic Developing Questions. Tends to diverge.

1009:  [[What kind of X is that X?]]

One of Clean Language's Five Basic Developing Questions. Tends to be detailed.

1010:  [[What does that X look like?]]

One of Clean Language's Five Basic Developing Questions. It tends to make people metaphorize or identify the name of the metaphor.

1011:  [[Where is that X?]]

One of Clean Language's Five Basic Developing Questions. "Where is it?" and "Where is it? Used in combination with [[somesthesis]] to specify the location in more detail. By identifying the location, it can be associated with [[somesthesis]], and it can be used to encourage [[metaphor]] and [[gesture]] to occur.

1012:  [[Where does that X come from?]]

One of the basic questions of clean language. This one is used because people don't want the "why" question to elicit self-justification.

1013:  [[Replacing constants with functions]]

1014:  [[Replace variables with random variables]]

1015:  [[Euclidean distance to general distance]]

1016:  [[Discretization of real numbers]]

1017:  [[Remembering the dimensions we are discarding]]
1018:  [[quaternion]]

1019:  [[Consider curved spaces.]]

1020:  [[Does it have to be one?]]

1021:  [[Try to pursue/abandon symmetry]]

1022:  [[I'll try to explain it to people.]]

1023:  [[Remember what you're throwing away.]]

1024:  [[Consider the duality]]

1027:  [[Note the average]]

1028:  [[Value close to 0]]

1029:  [[option value]]

1030:  [[Absolute and comparative advantage]]

1031:  [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]

1032:  [[Replace with data]]

1033:  [[Apology rather than asking for permission]]

1037:  [[prisoner's dilemma]]

1038:  [[Not all orders are present.]]

1039:  [[law of excluded middle]]

1042:  [[When only a subset can be observed, it makes sense that it could not be observed.]]

1043:  [[Deviation from the mean and sample size]]

1044:  [[There is more than one kind of distance.]]

1045:  [[The most efficient factories go bust.]]
