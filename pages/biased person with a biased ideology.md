    - [[Communication is symmetrical]]
- Symmetry cannot be broken without some non-human reference point.

        - We are many, they are few.
            - There's this collapse.
        - There are cases [[where both sides think their side is the majority]].

- [[ideology]]
- [[Position talk]]
        - [[Biases around entrepreneurship]]
            - [[All have a bias.]]
    - [[All statements are self-explanatory]]
