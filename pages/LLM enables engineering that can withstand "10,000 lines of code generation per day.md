> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1908365227344937199) "How can we best utilize such "good practice" knowledge today in 2025? We believe that the answer is to consider engineering that can withstand the 10,000 lines of code generation per day that LLM has made possible through the experience of Vibe Coding at this time." [First in Japan! Vibe Coding Training" will be the centerpiece of the 2025 graduate training program - Pepabo Tech Portal](https://tech.pepabo.com/2025/04/04/declaration-vibe-coding-training/)

> Even if it becomes possible to generate 10,000 lines of code/day/person every day, the system and the organization will surely fail if it is left hanging. This overwhelming volume must be managed in a sustainable manner and sublimated into value. This is the essence of the future of engineering.
