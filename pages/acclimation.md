> Habituation is a concept in psychology. Habituation is a phenomenon in psychology in which a stimulus is presented repeatedly and the response to that stimulus gradually disappears. Habituation is especially likely to occur with neutral stimuli that are neither rewarding nor harmful. Habituation is stimulus-specific. In other words, when an organism is accustomed to a stimulus A but is presented with another stimulus B, the organism responds to stimulus B properly. Almost all animals, not only humans, show habituation.
