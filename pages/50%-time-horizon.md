> [hillbig](https://x.com/hillbig/status/1953622811077227003) What interested me in the information related to [[GPT-5]] was that the 50%-time-horizon (50% success rate for a task that takes a human x hours to complete x hours) has now improved to 2 hours 17 minutes. It is on a trend of doubling in 122 days, and if it continues, it is estimated that a task that takes 18 hours one year and 47 days three years from now can be done at 50%.
