- Let's say you spend 30 minutes one way and an hour round trip to work.
- Assume 120 days of annual leave
    - Commute 245 days a year.
    - Spend 245 hours a year commuting.
- Let's say you commute for 40 years from your 20s to your 60s.
    - 9800 hours spent commuting.
    - Divide this by 24 and you get 408 days.
