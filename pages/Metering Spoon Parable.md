title: "Metering Spoon Parable"

> [yusula](https://twitter.com/yusula/status/1770420482472575393) I got a question before from Maro or something, "What do you do to add [[(the extent of) one's vocabulary]]?" I was asked a question like "When you are writing a sentence, if you feel even a little uneasy about the meaning of a word, you should definitely check [[the dictionary]] right away. I would check it with a dictionary right away.

> [yusula](https://twitter.com/yusula/status/1770420957729227047) I'm more afraid of this work, the [[misuse]] of the word [[care]] because I'm more afraid of the [[misuse]] of the word [[care]] but nothing, but I got a comment from a non-writer who said, "That, I'm sure it works, but I think it's too much work", so I think I understand a little bit more about the meaning of the discourse of "[work on something that can be continued effortlessly".

> [yusula](https://twitter.com/yusula/status/1770587869595459605) It seems that people who are in the habit of looking this up think, "Isn't it obvious?" I'm not sure if it's a matter of course for people who are used to looking things up, but there are many people who find the writing process painful to begin with, and I'm talking about people who take it for granted to use a measuring spoon when cooking and people who don't have one in the first place...

> [yusula](https://twitter.com/yusula/status/1770589247449485405) It's not that the rice of those who use measuring spoons tastes good and the rice of those who don't use spoons never tastes good, or that it's easier for those who can perform a useful method [[without stress]] and those who have to do it consciously. I don't think it's "[[natural]]" for all people, because it's easier for the former if you have to consciously do it.

The habit of checking the meanings of words in the dictionary to improve vocabulary may seem steady and troublesome to some. However, for those who have this [[habit ingrained in them]], it is a [[natural act]] and they probably do not feel stressed.

For [[people who are not good at writing]], looking up the meaning of words one by one may seem like an unnecessary burden. On the other hand, those who like writing and want to use words accurately] have developed the habit of willingly pulling out a dictionary.

I think [[even if]] the measuring spoons for cooking are accurate. People who like cooking and want to follow recipes properly will naturally use measuring spoons, but people who are not so interested in cooking may not. It is not a matter of which is right, but rather a difference in people's values and habits.
