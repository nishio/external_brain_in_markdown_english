title: "<I who go> do not go"

- [[From Wittgenstein to Ryuju]] p.93
    - [[Late Wittgenstein]] then "<Going I go>" would be a "tautology."
    - [[dragon tree (Dracaena draco)]] would say "<go I go>" is impossible ([[triple steal (baseball)]]).
        - [[dragon tree (Dracaena draco)]] then "<go I> don't go"
- Which is correct, [[Hiroshi Kurosaki]] stated that he thinks it is Tatsuki's.
    - interesting
