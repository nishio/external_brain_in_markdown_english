- Several multi-person projects have "created chat pages to lower the psychological hurdle of writing" or "created diary pages.
- On the other hand, that has not been done here, so I initially felt a high hurdle against writing.
- I read "[[Do not create an inbox]]" and understood that it was done intentionally.
    - > To be clear, the burden of such actions is high. Compared to that, creating an inbox makes it easy to write. However, the ease of doing so inhibits [[Uncomfortable Drive]].
    - >  We would like to proceed with this project with the hypothesis that this sense of discomfort will promote intellectual action.
    - [[What is Unnamed Camp?]]
    - > We will not create a page with the title as a proper noun first, but will only write a bean paper and then proceed to use the keywords contained within the page as links as an aid to the paper.
    - >  <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Am I understanding correctly that "instead of deciding on the page title first and then writing it, you write a chunk of text and then use an important phrase from that as the title"?
- Certainly the act of "writing a chunk of text and then titling the important phrases in it, rather than deciding on the page title first" is a load of work!
- I can see the argument that if there is a place to write comfortably, members' time will be consumed by it, thereby hindering intellectual action.
    - Related [[titling independence]], [[Where there is no load, there is no increase in capacity.]]
- I don't know what the term "discomfort driven" attached to it means.
- But, well, I guess this is "a concept that is now being verbalized," so I thought it would be better to experience it than to seek an explanation in words.
- So I did it.
    - As of this writing, there is no title on this page yet.
    - Now, what title to give it...
        - > The load of the act is high.
        - >  Discomfort
        - >  Advancing Intellectual Action
        - Why is [[uncomfortable feeling]] relevant when [[Advancing Intellectual Action]] in [[Burdensome action]]?

    - [[It takes courage to create your own page.]]
    - > Writing lightly and prompting a tsk-tsk like "No, it's not like that" (priming effect, [[Uncomfortable Drive]]).
    - Lightly written."
        - Doesn't seem to be a loaded act.
