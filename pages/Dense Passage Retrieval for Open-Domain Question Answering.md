title: "Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering"
---

> Open-domain question answering relies on efficient passage retrieval to select candidate contexts, where traditional sparse vector space models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de facto method. In this work, we show that retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a simple [[dual-encoder framework]]. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system largely by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks.

(DeepL) Open domain question answering relies on efficient sentence retrieval to select candidate contexts, and traditional sparse vector space models such as [[TF-IDF]] and [[BM25]] are the de facto methods. In this study, we show that learning embeddings from a small number of questions and sentences via a simple dual-encoder framework allows practical implementation of retrieval using only dense representations. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense search significantly outperforms the powerful Lucene-BM25 system in terms of retrieval accuracy for the top 20 passages by 9%-19% absolute, indicating that our end-to-end QA system can be used in multiple open-domain QA benchmarks to help establish a new state-of-the-art.
