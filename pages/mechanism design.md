title: "mechanism design"

> Mechanism design is a branch of economics. It aims to design rules (also called "mechanisms" or "game forms") that enable autonomous/decentralized realization of goals in areas such as [[resource allocation]] and public decision making, given a goal to be realized in the form of a function. [Wikipedia](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/メカニズムデザイン)

Sounds interesting. I had it confused with [[game mechanics]].
    - I knew about [[second-price auction]], but it seems to be an area that studies this sort of thing.
    - [[King Solomon's dilemma]]
    - [[Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem]]
    - > The only social choice rule that does not exclude a particular candidate and satisfies [[strategicity]] when society's preferences are determined by voting among three or more candidates is the [[dictatorship]] rule.
