<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Holacracy ([[Holacracy]]) is an innovative framework for restructuring [[organizational operations]] and management. Instead of a traditional hierarchical organizational structure, it aims to decentralize authority, clearly define roles, and increase flexibility and efficiency. Holacracy was developed by [[Brian Robertson]] and introduced in 2007.

Main features of holacracy
- [Role Clarification: In Holacracy, Roles, rather than traditional "job titles" based on job descriptions, are central. Each role has specific responsibilities, authority, and deliverables, and a person can have multiple roles.
- [Governance Process: Regular governance meetings are held to determine the organization's rules and role assignments. This allows the organization to flexibly adapt and continuously evolve.
- [[Decentralized decision making]]: Holacracy encourages each role to make decisions autonomously, rather than through top-down directives. This allows for rapid decision-making and action.
    - [[transparency]] : Information sharing and transparency will be emphasized so that all members of the organization can understand the decision-making process and the state of the organization.
- [Iterative Processes: Iterative processes are used in both governance and operations to promote continuous improvement and adaptation.
