What is given directly to [[the constitutive thought]] is not that which is constituted by thought, such as sensation or perception. It is [[the unity of master and guest]], [[the world of]] intuition, [[the object world of]] will.

Behind our concrete phenomena of consciousness, [[the superconscious]] [[the infinite]] is contained. Consciousness is not merely in "[[time of -]]," but "time" is established through the active unification of consciousness.

To [[recall]] the past is to [[intuit]] the past, although we are thought to intuit only the present. What is repeated in memory is not the senses, but the development of what was [[supersensory]] behind the senses.

From the standpoint of a truly subject-object congruent intuition, [[everything is]] the present, and "time" disappears into it. What is directly given to constructive thought is this infinitely deep world of intuition.

The concepts of "[[pure experience]]," "[[intuition]]," "[[will]]," and "[[the unity of master and guest]]," which form the core of Nishida's philosophy, are discussed in depth from the perspective of epistemology. Especially impressive is the emphasis on the workings of the [[superconscious]] and [[supertemporal]] that underlie [[conscious phenomena]], and the attempt to find the essence of intuition in them.
