I think that the "Mere Old Man" who says the same thing over and over again means that he cannot judge whether what he is going to say has already been said or not. If we write everything we want to say in Scrapbox and search for it in Scrapbox when we have something to say, we can "judge whether we have already said it or not" without any problem even if our [[living brain]] function deteriorates.

In other words, let's use Scrapbox to avoid becoming "an old man saying the same thing over and over again!
- (Not limited to Scrapbox)
- Seriously, I'd say record it in a [[searchable]] way.

- [[countermeasures against aging]]
