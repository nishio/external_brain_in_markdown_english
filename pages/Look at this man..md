> [minerva_owl1](https://x.com/minerva_owl1/status/1798739619162526057) You asked a question about the content, so I'll answer it! This is a book written by Nietzsche in his last years, and it is a rough introduction to his life and major works. It's sort of an introduction to Nietzsche by Nietzsche himself, and if you find one of the books interesting, you might want to pick it up!

> [minerva_owl1](https://x.com/minerva_owl1/status/1798739708522201129) By the way, the title "Behold this man" is in the original Latin, Ecce homo. This is a biblical passage, and Nietzsche is interesting in that he interjects biblical tidbits here and there, even though he rags on Christianity so much.

> [nanaya](https://x.com/nanaya/status/1798704466830712918) I only know the name Nietzsche and have never read a single one of his books... I've never read any of his books, but the power word "written just before he went insane" makes me want to read this book. (Yeah, let's read it!)

> [minerva_owl1](https://x.com/minerva_owl1/status/1798722717883212185) This book, an introduction to his own writings, might be a good first book to read because it is like an introduction to Nietzsche written by Nietzsche himself! It's fun!
