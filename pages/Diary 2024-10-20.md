> [tonghwi17](https://x.com/tonghwi17/status/1847770814466433258) As a result of more than 300 people responding on the "Public Opinion Map" about economic policy and high price measures, so far the statistics and AI are that these opinion groups exist The political parties are also positioned almost exactly as they are. The political parties are positioned almost exactly as they are, which is very interesting. It reveals the reality of public opinion, which is not simply left-right or [[big government]]/[[small government]] theory.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1847931149156573363) It is interesting to see Team Red, which does not represent any political party in this matter. This opinion cluster criticizes government subsidies and other policies and emphasizes individual voluntary defense measures. It's true that the idea that "the government shouldn't do a lot of things" is hard for political parties to advocate, so if you only look at the opinions of political parties, it's a vacant lot.

> [fpocket](https://x.com/fpocket/status/1847935639553278350) Perhaps there is a similar dilemma in the bureaucracy, where the good intentions of bureaucrats with a strong sense of justice seem to have no reason to exist from the standpoint that the government does nothing. I hope that Plurality will be the key to break through this situation.
