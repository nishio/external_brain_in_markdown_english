title: "Developmental dissolution of virtual laboratories"
---

We were chatting and the subject of [[Virtual Laboratory]] (2018) came up, and we were like, "Don't they do those anymore?" and we were like, "Don't they do that anymore?
- And as I was explaining, I thought, "Well, that wasn't explicitly stated in Scrapbox.

My response, "Well, what I wanted to do has already been accomplished."
    - [[2021 Unexplored Junior]]
    - > In 2021, for the first time in [[unexplored junior]], a "whole Scrapbox project including adopters" was created
- Unexplored Junior mentors adopt one to several people each year, and the adopters do a six-month project.
    - This is "laboratory" style
        - It's like a "two-year master's program with classes" has been compressed into "only six months of project execution.
        - Several of the graduates have remained active in the community.
            - This is like a PhD student
    - I apparently don't care much about "being Nishio's."
        - So I don't feel particularly inclined to name it "Nishio Lab."
    - All have a common chat and Scrapbox, it's like a student room.

So I thought, "Let's join and observe various Scrapbox communities to make it better.
- In doing so, one experiment was conducted.
    - [[unnamed-project]]
- Experiment started on 2022-03-07
    - Even an unknown project can be a project.
    - Once the second person joins, the conversation will take place there.
    - The second and third people get excited about topics I don't know about, and we hit it off.
    - They tried to eliminate the distinction between main and guest, but it didn't happen.
        - No matter how hard you try to erase Nishio, the fact that "Nishio started it" will never go away.
            - In that sense, it's amazing [[side of well]] the person who created it is gone.
            - When I myself became inactive, others became less active.
        - The atmosphere of the place can only be defined by the Lord
            - If the Lord wants "the people in the place to do whatever they want," He needs to make that explicit.

- Based on this experience, I designed the Scrapbox for the [[Omoikane Project]].
    - It was originally intended to be a single project with five founding members and its participants
        - We were proceeding in that form, but our schedule changed and we no longer had the requirement to be a single project.
        - No more deadlines.
    - Therefore, each member of the team verbalizes the projects he or she wants to do and shares the progress once a month.
    - This is similar to a meeting where students report on their research progress to their advisor, but I'm the one running the project, the advisor is not present.
        - Can we get an AI in here?
    - The members who are doing the project are like M2 and the members who are not doing the project are like M1.
        - No need to go on to M2 as it is not the same as a university master's program
        - It is beneficial to see what M2 is doing.

Why in the first place? The story of why?
- I consider the unexplored [[Boost Conference]] to be a good thing.
- But physical limitations on the number of people have made it impossible for some to participate.
- I see this as a problem that needs to be solved.
- So I realized that there is a desire to increase similar opportunities.
