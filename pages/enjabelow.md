A marker to tell [[Continuous Translation]] that the text below this line is a machine translation of the English text above it.

This design was not very good.
- There are often pages with a structure of "English text -> its Japanese translation -> additional comments", or commenting on the abstract of a paper at DeepL
- In reality, in many cases, it says (DeepL)

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/enjabelow](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/enjabelow) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
