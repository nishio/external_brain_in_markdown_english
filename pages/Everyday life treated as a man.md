Nora Vincent's [[Self-Made Man]]: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man was published in 2006. The author lived under the name "Ned" for 18 months and infiltrated eight different venues, including bowling leagues, convents, sales jobs, strip clubs, and romantic dates. The purpose was to empirically observe the "everyday life of being treated as a man" and to relativize the [[gender norms]] of both men and women.

## Key Findings
.
1. the nature of friendship
    - The camaraderie among the men was surprisingly warm, and I saw a cooperative effort to cover each other's mistakes while laughing at each other's mistakes. I realize that behind the superficial joking and competition, there is actually a deep [[desire for solidarity]]. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/5171860?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. cage of "masculinity
    - [The pressure to be brave, emotionally restrained, and financially responsible is strong, and the inability to be vulnerable amplifies the mental strain. My own experience of depression after the interview illustrates the intensity of the situation.

3. dating stress
    - The role of initiative is a series of "offer, pay, and be evaluated," and the fear of [[being rejected]] is great. The author temporarily became frustrated with women and realized the power of [[perspective reversal]]. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/5171860?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
4. workplace and hierarchy
    - Quotas and rankings are always visible, and [[a culture where]] weakness cannot be shown diminishes [[self-assurance]]. I experienced the "[[exhaustion of competition]]" hidden in success stories. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Made_Man_%28book%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
5. place of sexual approval
    - I understood that many customers in strip clubs buy "[[a]] sense of acceptance" more than mere excitement. I saw a nexus between male isolation and the need for approval. ([eBay](https://www.ebay.com/p/48319684?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Consequences and Impacts
Vincent summarized that "[[patriarchal authority]] hurts men as well as women," and urged that mutual understanding is essential for the liberation of both. The ethics of participatory observation using deception and sample bias became a point of criticism and sparked a lively debate in both [[men's studies]] and [[feminism]]. As an attempt to "know gender roles with one's own body," it is still regarded as an important primary source for the study of masculinity.

> [shioshio38](https://x.com/shioshio38/status/1664517012314533889) The experience of a writer named Nora Vincent may be helpful.
>
>  Nora Vincent, a lesbian woman who dressed as a man and entered the male community, initially thought that living as a man must be easy, surrounded by privilege, but when she actually entered, she felt the following.
>
>  > He was shocked to discover that life as a man is fiercely competitive, that no one takes care of you or cares for you, and that you have to prove yourself worthy of your existence.
>
>  > Within a group, men as individuals compete with other men. If they win the competition with other men, they are rewarded with wealth, power, and honor, and they can successfully reproduce, but if they lose, they have little or nothing at hand and cannot reproduce. As I wrote in my previous article, one of the problems with the feminists' way of thinking is that they have a bias to only look at men who are in the "upper" positions of success, wealth, and power in society, and not men in the "lower" positions. This prevents them from taking into account the fact that competition exists among men, and that there are many men who live in miserable conditions because of this competition.
