from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Endure a major break in luck.
cii
To be able to tolerate a major break in luck.

In the body of wisdom, the least important organ is a large stomach, and a large capacity implies a large portion. A large piece of luck does not impoverish one who can digest an even larger piece of luck. What may be excess for one person may be starvation for another. Many people suffer from weak digestion and are not born or trained to do great work, so they suffer from their inability to do so. Their actions become tasteless, the humor that arises from their undeserved honor rears its head, and they take great risks in high places. Talented people, therefore, should show room for even greater undertakings, and above all, they should show no signs of a small mind.
