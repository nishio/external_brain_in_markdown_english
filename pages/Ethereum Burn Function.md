title: "Ethereum Burn Function"

[First case in Ethereum 24-hour currency incineration exceeds issuance](https://coinpost.jp/?p=274036)(2021)
> Ethernet's burn feature was implemented on August 5 and was included in the proposed improvements to the fee model changes in the major upgrade "London" (EIP-1559).
> With the implementation of EIP-1559, the traditional ethereum fee will be "base fee" + "tip" (priority fee), with the base fee being subject to the burn and the priority fee being part of the minor's earnings.

> Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum has not had a cap on the total number of shares issued, so it has been viewed more as an inflationary asset. The possibility has emerged that the scale of basic fee burns will expand, and that the excess of issuance volume may increase the focus on deflationary assets.
    - I didn't realize that [[ethereum]] and [[bitcoin]] have totally different properties...
- Doesn't Ethereum have a [Total number of issues Cap.
- How is the issuance volume controlled? Is it written in code or is it a [[Governance Token]]?
