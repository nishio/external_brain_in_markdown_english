title: 'Cleanliness = S/N ratio" theory'
---

> [shields_pikes](https://x.com/shields_pikes/status/1563742660124639232) I think I have a verbalized definition of "[[cleanliness]]" in fashion and grooming.
>  Cleanliness = [[S/N ratio]]
>  In other words, you are calling a state where there is more noise than signal (meaningful information) "unclean".
>  So, rather than taking a bath every day, unwanted hair removal, branching hair removal, and concealer contribute more to cleanliness.

> [shields_pikes](https://x.com/shields_pikes/status/1563743383008727045) I've seen a buzz before about a picture of a crazy looking Chinese homeless guy, but that one is easy to understand.
>  That picture, there was almost no noise to the "wild fashion" symbol.
>  In other words, cleanliness was very high while cleanliness was very low.

> [shields_pikes](https://x.com/shields_pikes/status/1563751816369946625) The handsome homeless guy was a bit of an extreme example, but I think people who are trying to keep clean but are told they don't look clean should either tone their hair, skin, wrinkles in their clothes, etc. I think it's better to either have details in your hair, skin, wrinkles in your clothes, etc., or (and here's the important part) to set the tone with fashion that allows your details to come through as your personality.

> [shields_pikes](https://x.com/shields_pikes/status/1563841517789523968) In de-otaku fashion, people tend to dress in a cosplay-like manner in order to look good in the clothes themselves, but there is a "minimum level of detail required" for each item of clothing. However, there is a "minimum required detail = level of cleanliness" for each item of clothing.
>  The more formal-looking clothes, such as suits and dresses, fail because the level of cleanliness (low noise) required is higher.



> [raurublock](https://x.com/raurublock/status/1820246117378084988) I see. I had dimly suspected that "cleanliness" was context-dependent, but this explanation makes sense.
>  But when you have people who are insensitive to context, or who deliberately try to ignore context in order to argue their own point of view, it's all sorts of difficult...
>  >shields_pikes: no, cleanliness is "less noise". Unwanted hair, sleeping habits, and hemmed shirts are "noise", regardless of hygiene. With uniforms, mud is not noise, so it has nothing to do with cleanliness.
>
>  Strictly speaking, it may or may not be a proper S/N ratio (signal-to-noise ratio). x.com/shields_pikes/...

> [shields_pikes](https://x.com/shields_pikes/status/1820248523960733935) In that sense, people who are insensitive to context = can't read the air are often said to be unclean.
>
>  Strictly speaking, it's about being able to fit into the dress code of the place. Perhaps "misbehaving" in word and deed is also a deviation from the code of the place = noise.


This definition made sense to me, but "cleanliness = S/N ratio" seems a bit of an exaggeration (according to my wife).

Not clean.
- There's glue on my teeth.
- have something in one's eyes
- Nose hairs.
- Shirt collar is messed up.

Not quite the same as cleanliness.
- You're wearing weird jewelry.
- dark mole

>  Wife: "Likewise, shaggy hair is not clean, but the husband cannot keep it clean on his own, so I urged him to lose the hair itself."
>  I see! Cleanliness can be created!
