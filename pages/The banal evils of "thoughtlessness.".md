1. background
- In 1961, Arendt was asked by The New Yorker magazine to cover the [[Eichmann]] trial and offered the shocking expression **"the banality of evil "**.
- The Eichmann she saw was not a "monster," but a competent clerk who rationally optimized his boss's instructions.

2. mechanism of thought stopping
- Lack of self-reference
    - They do not narrate the act in their own words.
- Escape to the Rules
    - They shelve conscience judgments because "it's the law" or "it's an order."
- Lack of imagination
    - Because the viewpoints of others cannot be virtual, the consequences of an action cannot be felt.
Arendt called this "submission without reflection" and sought the starting point of evil not in the deep darkness of the personality but in the void of thought.

3. philosophical implications
- Subversion of the traditional image of evil = demonic impulse.
- He showed that in a modern bureaucratic and mass-organized society, ordinary people can cause enormous destruction.
- In his later work, "[[The Life of Spirit]]," Arendt presented the two stages of "thinking / judging" and discussed the necessity of ethical education to prevent cessation of thinking.
