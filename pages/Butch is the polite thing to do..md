> [nohcner](https://twitter.com/nohcner/status/1646699089667715072) I don't know how to cancel ETH Tokyo, if anyone is there, please tell them butch!

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1646701083228782592) staking is just slashed

> [nohcner](https://twitter.com/nohcner/status/1646701417745489920), right, thanks!

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646708289311506434) Instead of a human telling a human to cancel and going through the paperwork, [[staking]] is simply [[slash (fan fiction)]]. I thought it was [[Courtesy 2.0]], because it saves a lot of human time.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1646708478621401088) It is [[etiquette]] correct to [[butch]] without contact.
