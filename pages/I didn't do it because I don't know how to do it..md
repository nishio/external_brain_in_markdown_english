title: "I didn't do it because I don't know how to do it."

Most people who think, "I just don't do it because I don't know how to do it, and if I did, I would do it," are not taking action to figure out how to do it.
- [[excuse not to do something]]" as "[[I don't know.]]", so you unconsciously avoid "action to understand".
