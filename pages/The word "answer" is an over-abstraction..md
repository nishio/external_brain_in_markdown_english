title: 'The word "answer" is an over-abstraction.'

See the expression "[[The answer is not in me.]]" in the context of a business idea story.
> The expression "[[answer]]" is [[excessive abstraction]]. The answer to the [[question]], "What does [[client]] want me to solve?" is, of course, not within me, and I have to ask the client. On the other hand, the answer to the question, "What do I have [[enthusiasm]] for? When these two are combined, it works. The former alone is not enough.
