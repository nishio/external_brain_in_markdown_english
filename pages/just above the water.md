The previous advice is for "those who are already [[mentally]] comfortable" and is not appropriate for ### those whose mental state is just above water ([just barely

# Appropriate advice for those whose mental state is on the edge (just above the water)
.

[### ① First priority is to reduce load

- Avoid new loads and challenges.
- Organize the tasks you have and reduce the ones you can reduce.

[### ② Make recovery a top priority
]
- [[Preference for "rest" over "growth"]].
- Instead of "[[pushing yourself]]", "[[defend yourself]]".

[### ③ Be kind to yourself
]
- Don't think too much, "I have to work hard." Give yourself permission to say, "[You don't have to work hard now.
- Recognize that "rest and recovery are not laziness, they are necessary measures."

[### ④ [[Letting thoughts out of your mind makes it easier]]
- Write down "to-do's" on paper or in a tool to get them out of your head and reduce the burden on your brain.
- Write down your anxiety and impatience and look at them objectively to give your mind a break.

[### ⑤ A small reassurance
]
- We think, "[[It]] doesn't have to be a complete solution, [[just]] a little better."
- Take small actions (take a break for a few minutes, take a few deep breaths, etc.) to calm your mind, even if only temporarily.

### "Don't work too hard now. Let's rest first."
is an appropriate message.

The earlier advice about "a chance to expand your vessel" and "an opportunity to grow",
