>  I'm going to throw in a sudden thought, but when "[[ability to abstract]] is important", "ability to abstract" requires three mutually intertwined abilities: A: ability to find "things that are similar if you ignore the branches and leaves", B: ability to find common patterns among multiple similar cases, and C: ability to ignore the branches and leaves. C: the ability to ignore the branches and leaves,

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1696817507246776667) Ah, I see... So, first of all, one step of abstraction (=[[verbalization of experience]]) is necessary to transform all events or [[totality of unverbalized experiences]] into sentences that can be given to LLMs. I see... So, first of all, one step of abstraction (= [[verbalization of experience]]) is necessary.
    - [[Abstract the experience and put it into words.]]
    - [[Linguization is the abstraction of concrete experience]]
