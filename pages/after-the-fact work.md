- In order to establish preliminary work, it is necessary to verbalize and communicate in advance what the work is
- Is after-the-fact work hard to match with [[permanent employment]]?
        - Wouldn't it be better if there were no [[regulations prohibiting secondary employment]]?
- It may be easier to create jobs after the fact in the form of [[basic income]] if full-time employees are hired.
    - It is possible with the assumption that people have a [[generate work spontaneously]] mindset.
