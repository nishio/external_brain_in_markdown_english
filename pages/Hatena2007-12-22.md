*1198307807*continued
Exploring the dungeon (details omitted. I didn't think dungeons could be that hot!)
swotting up to the morning (to do something)
lie down
get up
Three thousand miles to visit a ramen shop (but actually 9 km)

*1198345654*Further continued...
After the first survival game, the University of Electro-Communications group left, and things suddenly got very quiet.
And I will be leaving Tsukuba after listening to a presentation by a high school freshman who made a Tesla coil, which will come tomorrow.
Huh. I guess I'm actually pretty tired.
