The concept of "metacommons," which emerged in the discussion, plays an important role in supporting intellectual property (IP) and the [[knowledge generation ecosystem]]. Specifically, it has the following characteristics

- Metacommons is positioned as a type of "[[commons]] ([[shared resources]])" that supports knowledge generation and research.
- This concept is the foundation for the creation of public goods, for which a funding and structural approach is essential.
- Metacommons is important to facilitate the mobility and scalability of knowledge and technology in academia and industry.
- The use of new technologies such as generative AI and blockchain technology is expected to enhance the metacommons and enable more effective knowledge sharing and technology transfer.

Overall, the metacommons is understood and discussed as a new framework that contributes to the sharing of knowledge and technology and the creation of their social and economic value.
