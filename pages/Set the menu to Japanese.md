title: "Set the menu to Japanese"
---

from [[pKeicho]]
- Set the menu to Japanese
    - The main part of the system uses Japanese natural language processing, so users are fixed Japanese speakers.
    - If that's the case, shouldn't the menu be in Japanese, too?

Hmmm... I guess I'll lower my priority then.
