title: "Spring Models and Deep Learning"
---

    - [[spring model]] is a system that updates the (x, y) number of vertices
    - The potential energy of the system is defined by the connectivity of the edges
    - Differentiating that potential energy yields the force
    - Update the position of a vertex with its force
- [[Deep Learning]] is a system that updates the weights W
    - The error function is defined by the relationship between inputs and outputs
    - Differentiating the error function yields the updated difference
    - Update weights by update difference

Calculating tension from the length of a spring in a spring model and using it to update the position of a vertex is only an approximate calculation on a poor machine, and as the Deep Learning boom speeds up the devices that do this type of calculation, better physics will be possible.
