# "[[Democratic Inputs to AI]]" in OpenAI
- Announced on 5/25: [Democratic inputs to AI](https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai)
- OpenAI "supports experiments to improve democratic processes."
- Total $1,000,000.00 ...... One hundred and ten thousand yen?
- What is this? [[democratic process]]`? Why would OpenAI pay 100 million for this?`

# Objective of "Democratic Input to AI"
.
- AI has far-reaching economic and social implications
- It is not right that [[decision-making]] of "what AI should be" is done by "[[a]] few people" such as the management of a for-profit company.
    - Should be shaped by "[[Diverse perspectives]]" that reflect [public interest (e.g., public good)
- Support experimental projects to take the first steps in this direction
- Recruit a [[team]] to develop a [[proof of concept]] of a [[democratic process]] that can answer the question, "What are the rules that AI systems should follow?"
- We (OpenAI) want to learn from these experiments and use them as the basis for a [[more global, more ambitious process]].
    - We hope to explore issues related to [[decision-making]] and build [[new democratic tools]] that can inform decision-making more directly in the future.

- Sounds really interesting, doesn't it?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - It would be interesting to participate in "[[an]] attempt for the future of AI" that OpenAI is flagging!
    - [[want to be involved in creating]] [the basis for a more global, more ambitious process!

# Applied!!!!!!!!
- We'll know the results on 7/15.
- Normally we don't talk about this kind of thing in the undecided stage, but as we started planning the project, the project members themselves started to get excited and said, "[[It's]] interesting, so let's do it regardless of whether it's accepted or not.
- We are already active and accepting applications for participation in the project.

# Things you must do if adopted
.
- requirement
    - Over 500 people will participate in the experiment.
    - A report on the findings from the experiment will be published on 10/20.
- This requirement of "more than 500 participants" seems difficult...?

# [[Code for Japan]]
- Here's the Code for Japan story
- Code for Japan is a general incorporated association established in 2014
    - > [[Code for Japan's Objective]]: To improve public services through citizen participation processes and contribute to society through better government and local government.
- Participatory Democracy Platform [[Decidim]] in Japan from 2020
    - 25 [[policy creation processes]] have been conducted so far in [[Kakogawa City]], with the most reaching 4,500 users
- I applied for this project as a Code for Japan project.
    - Mr. [[Haruyuki Seki]], the president of the board, is one of the members.
        - Five hundred? That won't be a problem!"
    - Code for Japan will do the contract with OpenAI, etc. as a legal entity.
    - (It would be great if a corporate entity with a track record of activities could act in such cases, as it would make things much easier<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='/nishio/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>)
- The feasibility of this process has increased dramatically!

# Project Structure
.
- A little "pizza" parable before going into the details
    - Once you have a "pizza base," you can add various "toppings" on top of it.
    - The minimal execution of the project is ensured by the pizza's base, which allows for individual experimentation in toppings.
    - Toppings can be tried and tested as you like, and only the ones that work should be released in the end.
    - I think everyone here is capable of making unique toppings.
- The foundation of the pizza is the [[iterative structure]] of "[[SF Prototyping]] + [[Polis-like system]]".
- What is [[democratic process]] anyway? Definition by [OpenAI
    - What is a "democratic process?"
        - (A) a broadly representative group of people exchanging views and [[careful deliberation]]; and (B) a broadly representative group of people exchanging views and [[careful deliberation]],
        - (B) Through a transparent [decision-making process
        - (c) It means the process that ultimately determines the outcome.
- Voting without good debate is not a democratic process.
    - Need a place for [[careful deliberation]] with people from different clusters
    - A common "[[basis for discussion]]" is necessary for deliberative discussion.
    - How to make it? That's where sci-fi prototyping comes in...
- In software development, prototyping gives a more concrete picture of [[what needs to be improved]].
    - But prototyping with software is something only software engineers can participate in.
    - So we need prototyping to create a story of the future in Japanese, this is SF prototyping.
    - With LLM's support, even ordinary people who are not science fiction writers get [[the means to prototype the future]].
- The stories created form a "shared perception" that "[[this kind of future]] could happen.
    - A number of stories make [[Future Width]] visible.
    - This is the basis for discussing how we can make a better future.

# Polis-like system
.
- [[Polis]] is mentioned by OpenAI itself in the grant commentary, and as an example, a Polis-inspired system is presented, which is an important elemental technology in this field.
    - There was a preprint from the joint team of [[Anthropic]] and Polis the other day that you might want to read.
        - [/nishio/Opportunities and Risks of LLMs for Scalable Deliberation with Polis](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/Opportunities and Risks of LLMs for Scalable Deliberation with Polis)
- Polis is a system for visualization and clustering of "[[voting matrices]]" created by multiple people answering multiple questions with Yes/No answers.
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/64a1c2e1128d84001bd26066.png)
- Multiple people answer multiple questions to obtain a "distribution of people's subjectivity"
        - [[From the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many]]
- Our team is now using Polis as a simple user, but that makes it hard to try new things technically, so we are creating a new system: [[Japanese cockchafer (Melolontha japonica)]].

# Repeat SF prototyping and Polis-like system
.
- ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/6499b485af32bb001bf19a81.png)
- Gradual improvement through repeated iterations [[iterative structure]].
- Gathering and visualizing reader feedback on stories generates new ideas and creates new stories
- All of these things accumulated and as a result...

# [[Japanese cultural AI]] can be done.
- AI can be created using a dataset of thoughts and emotions of Japanese speakers.
    - This AI will be available worldwide, allowing people to speak in their own languages
    - This AI facilitates [[cross-cultural understanding]] beyond language barriers and is a prerequisite for [[Global Deliberations]].
    - [[the basis for a more global, more ambitious process]]
- Many people may associate the term "Japanese culture" with classical culture, but the first thing I want you to imagine is...
    - [[Doraemon]]
        - A [[science fiction]] animated series that has been running for 44 years.
        - No one in Japan has ever heard of Doraemon, and the recognition of Doraemon is spreading quite well around the world.
    - Doraemon is creating a "[[AI is your friend]]" worldview.
        - The antithesis of the Hollywood-style "AI trying to destroy humanity" story
        - Those who envision a bad future based on the "AI trying to destroy humanity" storyline try to create legally binding regulations on AI.
- Another keyword that came up from the project participants: the
    - [[mourning god]]
        - A human-made tool, after long use, becomes a soul and eventually becomes [[god]].
        - Future image of LLM becoming wise and personable.
        - People in monotheistic cultures recoil at the idea of calling it "God."
        - The Japanese concept of "God" is quite different from that of monotheistic religions.
        - Japan has only 1% Christianity, while the U.S. has almost 70%.
    - AI is a tool, an argument that should be regulated to prevent it from acquiring capabilities comparable to humans.
        - God made man.
        - God is a higher being than man.
        - Man created AI.
        - You think AI could rival humans?
            - "The created can line up with the Creator" would be a challenge to the concept of "God is a higher being than man," irreverence!
            - Man has done God's work of "making man."
                - It is ethically undesirable, as is the cloning of human beings!
        - To make [[Global Deliberations]] possible, we need to understand each other's cultural differences.
        - Action is needed to help the people of the world understand the concept of doraemon and attached mourning gods.

# Technical feasibility of [[Japanese cultural AI]]
- It may seem like a pipe dream, but it is highly technically feasible.
- First, they use Scrapbox as a "place for communication".
    - Anything can be written here, including generated stories, impressions, and other ramblings.
- Realized implementations
    - Export data from Scrapbox once a day with Github Actions
    - Divided into chunks of 500 tokens and vector embedded with OpenAI Embedding API and stored in Qdrant
    - Web service that enables vector search with Qdrant is already available: [[Omoikane Vector Search]].
    - Now we just need to create a connection between the English UI and the ChatGPT API, and we will have a [[Minimum Viable Product]] that can be released to the world.
- Interesting points unlike a mere natural language corpus
    - ![image](https://scrapbox.io/files/64a1d12aa415f7001b913af4.png)
    - From [[the Polis-like system]] we can get the data "37% agree with this question, 37% disagree, 25% abstain".
        - Data on "the subjective distribution of a large number of people."
        - Since natural language sentences are paired with quantitative data, by hooking the first half of the sentence with a vector search and loading the quantitative data into the prompt, the chatbot can speak with knowledge of the distribution of Japanese thoughts and emotions.
    - In the future, it would be interesting to build a mechanism to collect human responses by asking questions to a Polis-like system with Function Calling.
        - It's like LangChain's [[Human as a Tool]] is being promoted to [[People as a Tool]].

# now in open beta!!!
- What one participant had to say
    - > New[[MMOTRPG]]の[[オープンベータ]]だと思っている<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/tsuzumik/icon' alt='tsuzumik.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - [[Acceptance or rejection has not yet been determined]], but we are prototyping the project itself in open beta!
    - Of course, you are welcome to join us after the adoption on July 15!
    - I want to recruit people from different communities to gather [Diverse perspectives
    - I think this community is a group of people who are positive about the use of AI and can implement it themselves.
    - It is important to create [[a common understanding]] so that what you have created will not be smashed by fearful [[Luddites]]!
