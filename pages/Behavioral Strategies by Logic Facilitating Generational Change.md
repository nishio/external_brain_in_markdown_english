title: "Behavioral Strategies by Logic Facilitating Generational Change"
---

- Demonstrate by logic, not by quotes from great men, that an action strategy that was useful in one situation is not useful in another situation
- Suppose there is an older person, A, and a younger person, B, and that person A has been successful in the past in situation P by taking action strategy X
- Mr. A tends to think "action strategy X is right" and tells Mr. B so
    - Precisely, "In situation P, action strategy X is correct."
    - In the current situation Q, it is possible that action strategy Y is more correct than action strategy X.
- Mr. A's opinion tends to be more justified than can be logically justified
    - Depends on Mr. A's age [[halo effect]].
    - Mr. A's results
        - It's not surprising that you have more achievements because you have more time resources used than Mr. B.
    - Mr. A's confidence
        - By experience, "I took action strategy X and actually succeeded."
        - Bias of thinking that one's past decisions were correct
- Input from Mr. A decreases the probability that Mr. B will take the preferred action strategy Y in the current situation Q
- How can we solve this problem?
- Mr. A's age, track record, and confidence are obstacles to any direct attempt to deny that "Action Strategy X is correct."
- First of all, acknowledge "Action strategy X is correct in situation P" and suppress Mr. A's rebellion.
- Then, it is shown by logic that the optimal action strategy changes depending on the situation.
    - Example [[The value of quality variation depends on the level of demand.]]
    - Example [[Average orientation is the worst environment]].
- This increases the probability that Mr. B will take the preferred action strategy Y in the current situation Q
- Promote [[alternation of generations]] in [[Action Strategies]] through logic

ref. This thought pattern is also an example of a [[Conflict Resolution Diagram]].
In [[Foreign Faith and Late Majority]], which inspired me to write this, I first
> I'm waiting for social proof because I'm afraid of risk-taking alone for something uncertain.
I realized that using the expression "I'm afraid" was assuming that the other party was acting emotionally rather than logically, so I rewrote it as "I don't think it's rational to take risks.
