> Taiwan's judicial and political system also stands out for its adaptability in comprehensively resolving longstanding social conflicts: in 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government must pass a law legalizing same-sex marriage within two years. After a referendum on a simple proposal to allow same-sex marriage was rejected in 2018, the government found creative ways to serve the interests of people from all walks of life. Many opponents of same-sex marriage were concerned that families opposed to same-sex marriage would be forced to participate because of the tradition of large families being bound together by marriage. On the other hand, most young people who wanted to take advantage of this new provision had a more individualistic, partner-centered vision of marriage and had no desire to bring families together, so the government passed the same-sex marriage legalization bill with a provision excluding relatives from the same-sex marriage process. The government passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage by excluding relatives from the process.

The main points of this discussion are as follows
- When Taiwan legalized [[same-sex marriage]], it recognized the part related to the rights and obligations of marriage, but excluded the part related to [[kinship]]. In other words, same-sex couples are recognized as married, but not as members of each other's family.
- This is in consideration of the values of the [[older generation]], and even those who oppose same-sex marriage are not opposed to the wedding itself, but they are not comfortable with the idea of families being related to other same-sex couples.
- The legalization of same-sex marriage is a democratic process that also reflects the results of [[the referendum]]. Some other Asian countries and regions are considering similar methods.
- Although issues such as [[adoption]] and [[artificial insemination]] by same-sex couples still remain, we are promoting a dialogue to deepen society's understanding of such children before they are born.
- Although there are generational differences in awareness, understanding of same-sex marriage is expanding, especially among younger generations. Progress is also gradually being made on [[transgender]] rights.
In other words, Taiwan has been promoting same-sex marriage in stages, and is trying to solve related issues while obtaining social consensus. This discussion is characteristic of the Taiwanese model, which has attracted attention as the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage.
