### Digest of Research Notes
.

My last research note was on the subject of "distressed alternatives are not much different". This presents the idea that the act of being distressed between alternatives indicates that those alternatives are rated as equally good.

Nishio's research note, "Nada School Saturday Lecture 2021," supports this idea. He states that when there are few options, it is beneficial to increase the number of choices. The fragment "When there is a difference of opinion, there is not much difference" also indicates the idea that when there is not much difference in evaluation between alternatives, it is better to choose according to one's own preference.

These considerations suggest that the act of struggling between alternatives is significant in that it indicates that those alternatives are evaluated as equally good, and that new perspectives and possibilities can be found by increasing the number of options.

However, there are those who oppose more choices. The "people who oppose more choices" fragment presents the perspective that more choices lead to a loss of security. This may indicate a human response to the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with more choices.

These observations indicate that human responses to the evaluation of alternatives and the increase in options are heavily influenced by individual values and emotions. This demonstrates the importance of subjectivity in the process of alternatives evaluation and selection.

Questions to further these considerations include "How should options be evaluated?" What are the advantages and disadvantages of increasing choice? and "How should the response to increased choices be managed?" and so on.
