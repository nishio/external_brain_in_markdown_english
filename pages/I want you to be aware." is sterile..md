- The "I want you to be aware" and "you should be aware" arguments are sterile.
- It's [[impossible]] if you put yourself in their shoes.
    - You are the one who needs to be aware of the "thing" first.
        - You'd say, "What is that thing...?
- The common [[bad communication]], "[[I won't tell you, but I will.]]

I want you to be [[self-aware]]" is [[barren]].
