It discusses the importance of finding value before others realize it.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The fragments "KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v1," "KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork_Lecture Material v2," "When to Change the KJ Method Front Page (Creation Process)," and "KJ Method Study Session Reflection Study Session" emphasize the importance of "awareness" for finding value. This is directly related to the subject matter of the notes.

## deep thinking
In order to find value, we believe it is important to look at things not only from our own perspective, but also from the perspectives of others and from new perspectives. This allows us to find value that others have not yet noticed.

## summary of thoughts
Incorporate others' perspectives and find new value.

## Title
.
Finding New Value in Other People's Perspectives."

1. it is possible to find value in things that others do not find value in. 2. if one's values are different from those of others, one can use those differences to find value; 3. if one's values are different from those of others, one can use those differences to find value

2. "Things that are far from my sense of value are undervalued," "Common sense is worthless," "The value to me of what I am is higher than all possible things," "On Self-Introduction," "Nodes of Thought 2021-07-15," "Counterintuitive Values," "Those who do not recognize value and those who do not recognize diminished value." I found connections with the fragments "Overvaluing Ideas," "Intellectual Workers Own the Means of Production," and "People Exchange What They Do Not Value for What They Do Value." These fragments provide insight into one's own values, the values of others, and how they create value.

3. finding value in things that others do not find value in is possible by utilizing one's own perspectives and values. In addition, when one's own values differ from those of others, one can use those differences to find new value.

4. "A perspective that finds value that others overlook."
