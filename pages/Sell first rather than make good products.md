title: "Sell first rather than make good products"

> [atrzdflw](https://twitter.com/atrzdflw/status/1698999553150837134) I asked him to elaborate, because the director of the mega-venture said, "If you want to popularize a service, you have to sell it first, rather than make a good product."

>  "People tend to think that if they spend time in the initial stages trying to make "good products," the rest will sell on its own, but they are mistaken.
>  He was very convincing when he said, "Sell first, so we can hear from real customers who are willing to pay, and because we get paid, we can devote resources to the process of making really good products.
>
>  We tend to be concerned about the degree of perfection of a service because of the eyes of those around us, but I thought it was important to enter the market quickly and dirtily in the start-up phase of a service.
- [[The idea that "if you make something good, it will sell.]]

> [Yoohei3](https://twitter.com/Yoohei3/status/1699069575005114648) That's true. If you sell a lot of products, you can get a lot of feedback, and even if the product is criticized as rough at first, it may be refined before you know it.

I understand the theory, but it doesn't feel right.
- I don't know if that's because I'm subconsciously avoiding "selling."
- I know that "selling" provides an opportunity to use the market to test ideas and connect with buyers.
- Selling" in this context is an exchange of cash for something you made.
    - [[Exchange Form C]].
        - [[Cash is weak capital]]
    - I'm not sure if that "selling" is what we should be aiming for.

### digest of notes
.
The mega-venture executive said that selling first is more important than making a good product in order to popularize the service. He said that it is a mistake to spend a lot of time in the early stages trying to make something good, and that by selling first, they can listen to true customer feedback and devote resources to the process of making something really good. He also said that during the start-up phase of a service, it is important to get to market quickly. However, some people have doubts about "selling"; they think it is a waste of time and money, and that it is a waste of time and money.

### Relation to Fragment
.
Fragment and Note, in "Wanting to Raise the Top 1% of Children in Japan - A Look Behind the Scenes of "Unexplored Junior"", share a common perspective on the approach to creating a good product. While Note emphasizes the importance of "selling first," Fragment states that "[[those who]] can create things based on personal experiences are strong," which is consistent with the idea of creating better products based on customer feedback obtained through "selling.

### deep thinking
From the notes and fragments, the idea emerges that in order to create a good product, it is important to first put it on the market and see how customers react. This indicates an approach of understanding the customer's needs and improving the product based on those needs. However, this may conflict with some of the questions about "selling".
