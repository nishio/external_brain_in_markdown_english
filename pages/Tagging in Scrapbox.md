    - > I rarely use hashtags.
    - When multiple seminars share a project
        - Rules for hashtagging which seminar.
    - Multiple arguments for a single issue
        - Rules for hashtagging for easy tracing of history
    - All other tags enclose words in the text with square brackets
    - > The criteria for selecting strings to be tagged is "future-self perspective". It is what do you want to extract in your future self?

Future Self Perspective" is a good keyword, and "Structuring Information" is done "in such a way that it will be useful to use the information in the future.
- If it's hard to imagine yourself in the future, what would you like to see happen if you and a colleague were working on a project together?
- Not limited to tagging
    - Pin any pages that you think are "good to look at first."
        - If there are too many to just pin and feel bad about it, make a page that summarizes the best pages to look at.

    - The only benefit of putting a "cat" tag on every "cat" page that comes up is that you can have a "cat" page.
- If you can't think of anything in particular, add one or more zany links, and they will surface at some point.
