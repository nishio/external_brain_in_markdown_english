Background information provided by Adner2002
- The idea was that existing firms would be replaced by new entrants with better technology, and older firms that were no longer able to learn new things would be eradicated
        - [[S-shape development of technology]]  [[Foster1986]]
    - technology trajectories [[Dosi1982]]
    - punctuated equibria [[Tushman&Anderson1986]]
- However, it was shown that there are cases of market capture by products with inferior performance
    - disruptive technology [[Christensen1997]] # disruptive innovation
- The phenomenon of disruptive technology is well known, but the mechanisms behind it are not yet clear.
- This paper focuses on the structure of demand
    - preference overlap
    - preference symmetry
- Shows a formal model so you can see what happens under different experimental conditions
- Computer simulation

- Tend to focus on supply-side interactions when discussing technology competition
    - Saturation of conventional technology [[Foster1986]] [[Utterback&Abernathy1975]].
    - Avoid cannibalizing existing products [[Kamien&Schwartz1982]].
    - Organizational inertia [[Hannan&Freeman1977]] [[Tushman&Romanelli1985]].
    - Lack of ability to acquire new technologies [[Henderson&Clerk1990]] [[Leonard-Barton1992]].
- But even without assuming those situations, technological transitions occur.
    - Existing technology has no limits [[Christensen1992]] etc.
    - New technology does not necessarily produce higher performance [[Christensen1997]] etc.
    - Existing firms are not incapable of learning new technologies [[Bower& Christensen1995]].
- Suggests that something is being overlooked.
