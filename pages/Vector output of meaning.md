title: "Vector output of meaning"
---

- The meaning of a word can be expressed in vector form.
- If only humans knew what the word meant.
- People can output that meaning vector.
- But it can't.
- Because the human device is a piece of shit.
- Because man has had no "means of outputting vectors" in the course of his evolution up to this point.
- Did not have the hardware means to output vectors
- As a result, the ability to output vectors was not fostered.
