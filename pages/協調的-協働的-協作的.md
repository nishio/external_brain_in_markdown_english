Discussion with GPT4 about the difference among 協調的/協働的/協作的

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> You are a linguist, knowledgeable in Japanese, English, and Mandarin. I chose '協働的多様性' over '協調的多様性' as the Japanese translation for "Collaborative Diversity". A friend in Taiwan told me it's expressed as '協作的多様性' in Mandarin. Seeing this, I was reminded of the Japanese term '共創的.' If my understanding is correct, '働' is a character made in Japan, and its nuance seems not to be conveyed well in Mandarin. Please explain the nuances of these words in Japanese and Mandarin in English, to aid in our mutual understanding.

- 協働的多様性 (Kyōdō-teki Tayō-sei) in Japanese:
    - 協働的 (Kyōdō-teki): This term combines "[[協働]]" (kyōdō), meaning "cooperation" or "collaboration," with the suffix "-的" (teki), which turns it into an adjective. The emphasis in "協働" is on [[working together]], often implying a more active, participatory form of collaboration. It suggests that all parties are actively involved in the process, contributing and working towards a common goal.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I just come up with the idiom
            - > Coming together is the beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success. --- Henry Ford(?)
    - 多様性 (Tayō-sei): This means "diversity" or "variety." It refers to the presence of multiple different elements or characteristics within a group or concept.

- 共創的 in Japanese:
    - 共創的 (Kyōsō-teki): "[[共創]]" (kyōsō) means "[[co-creation]]" or "joint creation." It carries the nuance of not just working together but creating something new together. This term emphasizes the innovative and creative aspect of collaboration.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> "作る" and "創る" are both "tukuru" in Japanese.

- 協作的多様性 in Mandarin:
    - 協作的 (Xiézuò de): "協作" (xiézuò) in Mandarin is akin to "cooperation" or "collaboration." It's about working together harmoniously but doesn't necessarily imply the same level of active participation or joint creation as "協働的" (kyōdō-teki) or "共創的" (kyōsō-teki) in Japanese. "的" (de) here is a grammatical particle to form an adjective.
    - 多様性 (Duōyàng xìng): This is the Mandarin equivalent of "diversity" or "variety," similar in meaning to its Japanese counterpart.

- Character Nuances:
    - [[働]] (Hataraku): This character is indeed uniquely Japanese (Kokuji), created within the Japanese language. It carries the connotation of "work" or "labor." Its inclusion in "協働的" might convey a sense of active engagement and labor in collaboration, a nuance that might not be fully captured in the Mandarin "協作的 (Xiézuò de)."

- Cultural Context:
    - Both Japanese and Mandarin have a rich tradition of valuing harmony and collective effort. However, the specific choice of words can reflect subtle variations in the emphasis on how collaboration and diversity are perceived and valued in these cultures.

In summary, while "協働的多様性" and "協作的多様性" share the core concept of "collaborative diversity," the former (Japanese) places a stronger emphasis on active and engaged participation in collaboration, whereas the latter (Mandarin) conveys a more general sense of working together harmoniously. "共創的" in Japanese adds an element of joint creation and innovation to the collaboration.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> How about "協調的"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The term "協調的" carries its own unique nuances in both Japanese and Mandarin, distinct from "協働的" and "協作的."
- [[協調]] (Kyōchō): This word means "coordination" or "harmonization." The focus here is on the harmonious integration of different elements or parties. It emphasizes the aspect of making different parts work together smoothly, rather than the active engagement or creation aspect emphasized in "協働的" (Kyōdō-teki). ... In Mandarin, "協調"(Xiétiáo) also means "coordination" or "harmonization."
- Versus "協働的" / "協作的": While "協働的" (Kyōdō-teki) in Japanese and "協作的" (Xiézuò de) in Mandarin emphasize active collaboration or working together, "協調的" is more about the process of aligning or balancing different elements or groups to achieve harmony and efficiency. It's less about active joint labor or creation and more about ensuring that different parts function well together.
