> I was wondering why people at the level of lecturing at universities come to SUD courses, and I was thinking, maybe that is the wrong question.
>  In other words, I was thinking, "Why would someone at the level of a university lecturer take a university course for working professionals?" I thought it might be "people at the level of lecturing at universities are so [[Willingness to learn]] that they are willing to take courses for working adults at universities" rather than "people at the level of lecturing at universities are so [[Willingness to learn]] that they are willing to take courses for working adults at universities.
