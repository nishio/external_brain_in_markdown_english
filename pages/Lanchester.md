title: "Lanchester"
---

- A [[mathematic model]] of combat in operations research published by Frederick Lanchester in 1914.
- Figures such as the upper target value (73.9%) are not from Lanchester himself, but from Grand Commodore Axeta & Nobuo Taoka.
    - Apparently, the derivation process is described in the book "Science of Winning the Race."
    - Combined with [[theory of games]] we arrive at [[Koopman's]] strategic model.
