title: "local optimum"
---

- The entire production process is interconnected and influences each other [[system]].
- Looking at just one part of it and making improvements will not improve the overall performance.
    - Splitting and optimizing doesn't make sense.
        - Negation of [divide and rule
    - We need to identify [[bottleneck]] and work on it.
    - [[gold rat]] thought that all [[systems]] would need to do the same.
    - This is [[overgeneralization]].
- The production process of physical things is [[DAG]] because of physical constraints, but the general system is not.
