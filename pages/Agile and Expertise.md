title: "Agile and Expertise"
---

> [tokoroten](https://x.com/tokoroten/status/1847622093388775521) I was talking to someone and I was thinking that the so-called "[[agile]]" is a way of thinking that is unique to a time when programmers' specialties were not as differentiated as they are now. I wonder if this is not the case.
>  Since the modern world is so differentiated, we're talking about how to borrow experts, which doesn't mesh with the original principle.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1847636767006216524) Once the programmer's [[expertise]] has [[differentiation]], but then [[LLM's underpinning]] allows him to do 90% of things on his own. It may be important to be able to build a broad network of "[[non-full-time experts]]" that can be relied on when the 10% of matters that AI cannot solve arise.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1847921973596430791) This may be a question of which layer of [[agility]] to put out and where is the [[bottleneck]] that is hindering agility.
>  If the bottleneck is understanding [[customers' requests]], then we release small products quickly to encourage them to verbalize their requests, and if the bottleneck is a lack of expertise, then we seek the help of experts.
