> It describes how the clan side contacted Tokushima Castle when the pirate ship appeared on January 15, 1830, the local security arrangements, and how the clan members and local residents worked together to repel the ship.
> The description of the boomerang is written in a scene where the clan members approached a foreign ship in a boat and were asked for rice and water by the ship's crew. The samurai approached the ship and asked the crew for rice and water. The "things as shown here" are thought to be boomerangs.
