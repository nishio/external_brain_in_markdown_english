Heavy multitaskers" who handle multiple media at the same time are not good at "filtering out information that is not relevant to the task," which increases task [[switching costs]].

### Summary (concise version)
.

This study compared the cognitive control abilities of "heavy media multitaskers" (HMMs), who handle multiple media simultaneously, and "light multitaskers" ( light media multitaskers (LMM). In the experiment, HMMs were asked to perform multiple tasks, including switching attention, filtering out irrelevant information from their working memory, and updating their working memory. and tended to focus on the necessary information. This difference cannot be explained by mere differences in IQ or working memory capacity, suggesting a link between the habit of simultaneous media use itself and cognitive control ability.

### Explanation

1.### Background and Objectives
.
    - In recent years, the behavior of using multiple media at the same time (media multitasking) has increased.
        - However, human attention and working memory have limitations, and it has been considered difficult to process multiple sources of information simultaneously.
    - In this study, we examined what differences exist in cognitive control between chronic users of multiple media (HMMs) and those who do not use them very often simultaneously (LMMs).

2.### Experiments and Methods
.
    - First, the "Media Concurrent Use Index (MMI)" was calculated from the media use questionnaire, and those with a high MMI were defined as HMMs, while those with a low MMI were defined as LMMs.
        - Cognitive tests such as filtering and task-switching tasks were then conducted.
    - The filtering task looks at "how much irrelevant stimuli can be blocked".
        - [[関係ないものを無視する力]]<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - The task-switching task looks at "how quickly the previous set of tasks can be discarded and moved to a new set of tasks.
3.### Main results
.
    - HMMs are easily drawn to extraneous stimuli, and unwanted information is easily introduced into working memory.
        - Even when switching tasks, the HMM is affected by the previous set of tasks and tends to take longer to switch.
    - On the other hand, LMMs tended to block out irrelevant information relatively well, keeping them focused on the task.
        - These differences cannot be explained by differences in intelligence or working memory capacity.

4.### Discussion and Significance
.
    - The frequency of handling media simultaneously may undermine intentional attentional control.
        - However, this study shows a correlation, and it is not clear which is the cause (i.e., whether multitasking leads to decreased control or whether people who have weak control to begin with prefer to multitask).
    - In any case, it is suggested that those who are in the habit of using multiple media more often are less likely to eliminate unwanted information and are at risk for lower work efficiency.

--

This study suggests that people who use media more frequently on a daily basis may be more prone to cognitive control disturbances ([[distraction]] and delay in [[task switching]]). In today's society, where people are exposed to a large amount of information, it is important to keep in mind that media usage affects attentional control ability.

### 1: What is meant by "media"?
This study includes a wide range of media forms, including

- Paper (print)
- TV.
- Video on a computer (e.g., YouTube or other online video).
- music or other audio.
- video games and computer games.
- Voice calls on phones and cell phones.
- Instant Message (IM).
- SMS (short message).
- Email.
- Web Browsing.
- Other PC applications (e.g. word processing).

In other words, the degree to which one person uses a combination of these media during the same time period is measured as the Multitasking Index (MMI).

### 2: Effect on memory
.
Studies have shown that the heavy multitasker (HMM)

- Failure to filter out unwanted stimuli in the external environment, and extra information easily enters the working memory.
- Unnecessary information already in memory (previous tasks, old letters, etc.) cannot be successfully ignored.

As a specific example, in the ### N-back task (judging whether a letter is the same as the one that appeared three letters ago)
, HMMs showed more false responses to older stimuli (assuming that it is "the target"), especially as the load increased and the interference of irrelevant information increased. As a result, it can be said that ### the ability to eliminate "originally irrelevant" information in working memory was reduced
, and a tendency to not be able to use memory efficiently was observed.


Below is a brief explanation of what each of the figures (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3) in the paper illustrate.

Fig. 1 (filtering task)
- (A) The top row is an illustration of a "single trial" of a filtering assignment.
    - First, an image with a row of red and blue rectangles is displayed for 100 ms (red is the "target" and blue is the "stimulus to ignore (distractor)").
    - After a short pause, a similar arrangement appears again.
    - Participants are instructed to answer whether "the orientation of the red rectangle has changed.
- (B) The lower graph shows the change in grades versus the number of distractors (0, 2, 4, 6) "when the red rectangle (target) is 2".
    - The horizontal axis is the number of distractors and the vertical axis is performance (e.g., K-value, an index of working memory capacity).
    - It has been shown that HMM (heavy multitasker) performance declines as the number of distracters increases, while LMM (light multitasker) is virtually unaffected.
    - This suggests that the HMM is not good at filtering out extraneous information.

Fig. 2 (AX-CPT task: comparison with and without distractors)
- The AX-CPT task is to press "YES" if the letter "A" appears as a cue followed by "X" and "NO" otherwise.
- This figure compares the reaction time in the "standard version (without distractors)" and "with distractors pinched".
- The vertical axis of the graph shows reaction time (the slower the better), and the horizontal axis shows the "without distractor" and "with distractor" conditions.
- Under the condition with distractors, the HMM responds significantly slower than the LMM.
    - This represents the inability of the HMM to ignore irrelevant stimuli and the stagnation of processing in the brain.

Fig. 3 (2-back and 3-back assignments)
- (A) is the hit rate (the percentage of correct answers that correctly answered "target" as the target).
- (B) is the false alarm rate (the percentage of letters mistaken for "target" that are not originally targets).
- There are two types: 2-back (to determine if the same letter is used as the previous two) and 3-back (to determine if the same letter is used as the previous three), with the more difficult 3-back comparison being particularly important.
- Hit rate is not much different between HMM and LMM, but HMM has more false alarms (wrongly judged as a target).
    - Especially when the retained information increases, as in the case of 3-back, the misreaction is noticeable.
    - This indicates that the HMM does not suppress unwanted information (already stale characters) well and is susceptible to interference from working memory.

--

Overall, these figures show that ### HMMs have less ability to filter out irrelevant information and are unable to suppress unwanted information from entering the working memory, resulting in lower task efficiency
. On the other hand, ### LMMs are less affected by distractors and are more likely to focus on necessary information
.
