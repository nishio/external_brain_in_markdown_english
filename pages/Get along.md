> When the dry wind blows violently ahead of you, if you cast one of your spells, [[it will be my pace]].

>  [I won't let you get in my way.

> Far away [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] [[as I want to]] continue my journey.
- [[selfish]].
> I'm going to put a smile on my face and call it a day.
> Far away I want to go beyond today with many magical powers
> I'll keep walking toward the future as far as I can get along, try again

> Far away We're not alone, we're in this together Far away
> I'll keep walking toward the future as far as I can get along, try again


>  If you look like a girl, but let your guard down, you'll go to hell [I won't let you get in my way.
>  Far away [[I want to continue my journey as I wish, as selfishly as I wish]].
