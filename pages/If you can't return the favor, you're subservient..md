- [[Competitive Giving]]
    - > A particularly common practice in traditional societies, in which the public giving of gifts at ceremonies and other occasions allows the gift giver to gain prestige and obligates the recipient to return the gift. In particular, the recipient may be censured and lose his or her position if the gift is not properly returned within a certain period of time. Famous examples include the [[potlatch]] customs of the indigenous peoples of North America.
