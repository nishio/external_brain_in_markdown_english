probability resonance

If the sensor has a threshold for response, it cannot respond to minute signals. However, by adding noise to the signal line, it can probabilistically respond to signals below the threshold.
It can be viewed as a way to divert resolution in the time direction to resolution in the value direction.

### digest of notes
.
The sensor cannot respond to minute signals, but by adding noise, it can respond to signals below a threshold value. This can be interpreted as a way to divert time-axis resolution to the value direction.

### Note and fragment association
.
The notes relate directly to the "stochastic resonance" of fragments. Both describe the problem of the sensor's inability to respond to tiny signals and the addition of noise to solve it.

### deep thinking
Notes and fragments offer a new perspective on solving information transfer problems. The idea that the problem of not being able to detect minute signals can be solved by adding noise has the potential to improve the efficiency of information transfer.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
'The addition of noise improves the detectability of small signals.'
