title: "Information gathering is an endlessly expanding task"

[[Information Gathering]] is [[An Infinitely Expanding Task]]
- [[Probabilistic Rewards]] often lead to its overestimation
    - [[Intermittent Reinforcement]]

[[Internal Exploration]] and [[External Exploration]]
- Aimlessly wandering outside without considering [[where to explore]] is inefficient
    - [[Searching for the Key under the Streetlight]]
- First, it's important to conduct [[Internal Exploration]]
- [[Aimless Wandering]] can be useful as [[Entertainment]], but don't fool yourself into thinking it's productive information gathering

This is said as a [[Self-Reminder]]
- Lately, I too have been [[Restless]], especially watching the movements of OpenAI
- [[Calmness]] is necessary
- [[Restlessness]] and [[Aimless Information Gathering]] won't bring [[Peace]], [[Confidence]], or [[Calmness]]
