about  [[Life Strategies]]

from [/villagepump/life-strategy](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/life-strategy).
- As for number two, "[[幸せの形]]は人それぞれだから別に他人がどうでもいいんじゃない？」という気持ち<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Happiness comes in different forms. Don't let other people's words fool you.]]
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I feel like I want to hear about the happiness of Mr.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[Happiness = not being prevented from doing what you want to do.]] かなー<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The second Post figure shows that "[[happiness]] 」の中に「 [[being worth doing]] 」とは別に「 [[pleasure]] 」の箱があるのですが、ここはどうでしょう？<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - [[desire for approval]] 以外の快楽にあまり興味がなく、その「承認欲求」も「多くの人に注目されたい」というタイプではないため比較的簡単に充足されてる感じ<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [[Pleasing the masses is evil.]]
        - So I feel like I've never been too aware of it because I haven't felt "[[hunger]]".
    - (*1) and others <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/> also forced to expand their desire for approval and made it that way.
        - (*1)
            - In my case, "pleasure" seems to be mostly a need for approval.
                - Let's say we include things like the joy of accomplishment in the desire for approval.
                    - I'm happy when I can test a hypothesis I had in mind, even if someone doesn't praise me for it.
                    - In a sense [[approval from the world]]?
        - But I think the "pleasure" part of this diagram could still use more resolution or a different structure that fits better.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - 「[[世界からの承認欲求]]」とか「[[世界支配欲求]]」とか「[[自分の有能さの検証]]」とか、色々な側面はありそうだけど、この図は割と偏ってそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - So you felt like, "[[Happiness]] comes in different forms..."
        - I'm inclined to disagree with this figure too much.
