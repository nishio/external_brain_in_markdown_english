Oh, stream it.

Average number of pages created per day per active user>1
- I feel like I'm pushing the average up a lot by myself. w

Save slowly, not reflexively.
- Then stir.
- A place to store thoughts
- Reflexive statements and specifications at a meeting can produce a bad product.

Search and create become one.
- Not searchable on the blog.
    - What is "search" in the case of
        - I can quickly come up with what I've written in the past and make connections.
- Google's search engine can do searches because it has links to
    - Google Drive
- →"search" here is used in a different way from the general meaning of the word.
    - Thought patterns that make it easy to search
        - More search paths

Both "spaceships" and "ush" for icons are verbalized.
- Someone has to anticipate and verbalize it in advance to get a hit.

Supporting Study Groups
- It would be nice if the study itself could be accelerated with Scrapbox, but how can it be done?

- He thinks it's a good idea to use the products he makes himself.
- I want to streamline information sharing for my team.
    - Agile team of 8~10 people
    - Because of the characteristics of a flow-type wiki that allows simultaneous editing
- As the number of people increases, the amount of time and tacit knowledge for information sharing increases.
    - Languages take time to develop.
        - It's a "ask that guy and he'll tell you" kind of phenomenon.
- Time cost of information sharing needs to be lowered.

I'm curious about this water surface diagram.
- Not on Scrapbox

Facilitator speaks alone.
- I don't see the point of a facilitator.
Unlike chat, multiple topics can be output simultaneously, so there is no blocking problem.

There was a lot of chatter on Slack.
- however, the problem that flows

Scrapbox is collective knowledge, esa is people-driven
- esa focuses on who thinks what
    - Occurrence of Authority
- Scrapbox, on the contrary, tries to hide whose opinion it is.

It's fun to get comments, so let them watch for 3 minutes and get comments.

Viewpoints and perspectives

Four lines of projects are running in parallel.
- I had created a Scrapbox project for each project.
    - They created similar pages and reported similar bugs.
    - It's not right to divide them into projects, it's better to have them all in one.
        - I can export to JSON and import, but if the title is the same, it will be overwritten.
        - Automatic title conversion.
    - It's cheaper to combine them into one unit because you're charged per project!

I used to use Pukiwiki -> Google Sites -> Scrapbox

Not just for projects.

Easy to copy pages including images
- It's on Gyazo.
- I guess Pukiwiki's system of attaching to pages was bad.
- Good effect is that the image reverts to notation when copied.

How does it work with GyazoTeams?
- I don't know, I've never used it.

Taking meeting minutes in Scrapbox is great!
- Taking minutes alone is exhausting.
- Multiple people can help each other if they're co-editing.

Slides are converted into PDFs and then into images and put up one by one.

It looks like I can put up an mp4.

I want to use it offline.

Need to share with people outside the company
- I'm printing it out and sharing it as a PDF.
- Create a new project and copy and paste only the pages you need, no more than 100 pages.

In a hierarchical wiki, there's a "don't build in this place" or something like that.
- I don't have to worry about it before "creating a page" because Scrapbox doesn't have it.
    - I would venture to say the title.
- Others can tag and give them to you later.

Scrapbox for both personal and company technology blogs

--- Panel Discussion"
[/scrapbox-square/Scrapbox SQUARE #2 Panel Discussion](https://scrapbox.io/scrapbox-square/Scrapbox SQUARE #2 Panel Discussion).

    - How much do you tag past minutes? Or is it mainly search?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - →One (Mr. Koga)
        - southern acid
            - Post images as much as possible because text alone is not interesting.
            - I'll put the slides up first.
    - Derailment during a meeting
        - Remote work: At first I was sending video, but once I got used to it, Scrapbox was enough.
        - Facilitators are not decision makers.
            - You can comment wherever you like, and make it a rule to do so.
            - Facilitators can be ignored.
        - Many meetings have slides prepared ahead of time.
        - Not much use for Brest.
    - Commonalities in various sites?
        - Nota is the most extreme, with half and half of the teams in Kanto and Kansai.
        - Scrapbox would shorten the meeting itself.
            - →If the density in time increases, if the meeting itself disappears, various
                - Quality is improving, shortening is not attractive.
            - Since it will be done only on Scrapbox
                - Discussions on Scrapbox are easier to read and understand than regular meeting minutes.
    - Icons show empathy.
    - Do you make temples for different purposes?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/sngazm/icon' alt='sngazm.icon' height="19.5"/>

- They were two management people.
    - Scrapbox's advantages for management

        - (Nanjisan) When it comes to Scrapbox, you can create pages without being formal (compared to Google Sites).
        - (Koga-san) An effective tool for not leaving things unknown in an environment with a diverse workforce
        - Before Nota's Scrapbox: Dutifully Video Chatting in Slack
            - →I can't sleep at night.
            - The relationship between monitoring and being monitored
            - Individuals write a plan in Scrapbox that says, "I want to do this next.
                - Reliable, with the direction of travel visible without having to monitor the daily reports verbatim.
                - Trust is built on what you want to do, not what you could do.
                - [/remote/How to generate trust remotely (shokai)](https://scrapbox.io/remote/How to generate trust remotely (shokai)).
                - confidence building
                - Shared goals are important for trust.

It's really hard to introduce, or rather proselytize.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/geta6/icon' alt='geta6.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I know exactly what you mean<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/xKxAxKx/icon' alt='xKxAxKx.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If you force people who are not motivated to use it, activity will gradually decrease and eventually it will stop being used.
    - sadness
    - How can motivation be created?
    - Sometimes it works out rather well the first time, like when you want to get rid of a problem in a spot where you have a goal.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/geta6/icon' alt='geta6.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Beyond that, it often does not lead to an ongoing stock of knowledge.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/geta6/icon' alt='geta6.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - It's like making a messy dictionary, just write it down and let them revise it as they see fit.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/shokai/icon' alt='shokai.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Maybe it's hard to get to the point where there's an expectation that "Here's the information I want!" It may be difficult to get to a state where there is an expectation of "Here is the information I want!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/geta6/icon' alt='geta6.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Two directions for introduction
    1. only those who know what they're doing can use it
            - I see<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/yamanoku/icon' alt='yamanoku.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - For Intelligent Workers
            - →Making more friends.
            - More examples of good use.
        - It does not function well when used by people who do not understand it.

    2. a line to be used widely by everyone
            - take time
- There was already a Wiki (Nanjisan)
    - I transitioned first with only a team of 10 people I was looking at and saved the know-how on how to use it.
        - There are also examples of mistakes that should not be used in this way.
            - It is not a good idea to use it for something that is more useful with a hierarchical structure.
        - Deploy company-wide after storing know-how

--- shokai
- A story about implementing Scrapbox with Scrapbox
    - Functional design and consultation
        - Ambiguous words
            - You can write as many definitions as you like on separate pages.
        - Important to be easy to "link" when referring to features that affect each other
    - What is "context?"
- write crudely
    - Others rewrite it on their own.
        - OK as long as the meaning remains the same.
        - Make jargon a link
            - Create a common language within the company
                - They start using the same words with the same meanings.
- I will write "I am" and "I think this."
- Make sense in context between pages.
- The meaning of terms is being defined.
- Not much of a roadmap.
    - We have a blueprint.
        - Suitable because it is an in-house developed product
    - Assuming that the Web will become faster in the future, etc.
        - I'm very suited to a lab-like organization.

No messaging.
- Not giving each other instructions.
    - Share your thoughts and act on each of them.
    - Let's reduce communication."
        - Once you have a model of the other person's thinking in your mind, you'll know what they're thinking without having to verbally communicate with them.

- PWAs are vaguely defined.
    - Web apps that are working hard.
    - Store in cache
- You can reload and view the page even when wifi is turned off.
    - I want to be able to edit offline.

- Completely independent from scrapbox.io and has the same infrastructure configuration
    - → should scale to the same degree.
