>  @raurublock There are some ideas about a post-COVID-19 society, like "not having much contact with people will be the norm", but as a counterpoint, it's possible that people will get used to the fact that about 2% of the population dies every year and stop caring, and that society will incorporate that. It's not inconceivable.

Historically speaking, the period of that structure would have been longer.
