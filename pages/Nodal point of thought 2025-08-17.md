- 3) Design of "I don't know" = starting point of education
    - Not pushing "I don't know" out of shame → lost learning opportunity.
    - Design implication: Instead of making the buttons stand out, the dialogue AI estimates the level of understanding behind them → gentle insertion of insufficient knowledge (short explanations/illustrations/videos) → prompts re-answers.

- [[Polis]]'s "I don't know" is not an indictment of the respondent, but a signal that the contributor's text was not understood by many people
    - But there are quite a few people who have strong psychological resistance to pressing "I don't know."
        - Feeling that admitting that you "don't know" is an act of lowering yourself and undermining your self-esteem
    - So, it might be better if the AI decides during a conversation that "this person doesn't understand something," and then quietly inserts some learning content.
