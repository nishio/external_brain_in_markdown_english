I tried to translate "[[There are two types of genus elimination.]]" into English, but I couldn't find the English word that corresponds to "genus" in one word.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1498575947293163520): what's the English word for attribution? Is there no good one-word word and you have to say [[Dependency to a specific person]] or something like that?
- > [geinin](https://twitter.com/geinin/status/1498577128614346754): if you mean that the work is dependent on a specific person, then "[[with no standardization]]"?
- > [otsune](https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1498577472345948166): [[key person risk]] or [[bus factor]]?
- > [kyoheif](https://twitter.com/kyoheif/status/1498577613521965056):[[dependent on individual]], I guess
- > [shima__shima](https://twitter.com/shima__shima/status/1498624495795404806): You may have already looked for it, but Eijiro has the following
    - > >be dependent on individual skills/expertise

Surprisingly, there is no English word that corresponds to "genus" in one word.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1498584849070067714): Is "genshi" or "[[Elimination of Genus]]" a [[Galapagos concept]] specific to Japan?
- > [saitamasaitama](https://twitter.com/saitamasaitama/status/1498585681572282368): isn't it about [[truck number]]? (how many people get hit by trucks and the project is ruined)
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498586196859326464): From what I have seen in some of the main companies outside of Japan, there are many cases where they have such a concept but don't see it as a problem (in other words, they turn a blind eye to it or think it can't be helped). I think there are a lot of cases where they have such a concept but don't see it as a problem (in other words, they turn a blind eye to it or think it can't be helped). (In other words, they pretend to turn a blind eye to it or think it can't be helped.

If he is doing a job that can be done by anyone else, what's the point of paying him so much money? He said, "I know he is the only one who can do it.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1498586677459419137): ah, I see
    - > >They are not afraid to say, "Oh, the guy who was doing that quit.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1498587018426990595): would that mean that there is a strong tendency in Japan to "consider gentry as something that is very hostile and must be eliminated"?
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1498587361432973314): "Let's make humans homogeneous and interchangeable cogs" kind of idea.
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498637068276498434): It seems to me that there is a widespread view that the attributes themselves are also the source of each person's [[job security]], and that there is a perception that it is prudent to say, "I want to make this available to other people...", because there is sometimes resistance to such a request. I'd like to make it so that other people can do it, too, but...", there may be resistance (sometimes), so it seems to be recognized as prudent to do so.
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498638442947026944): I think the reason why there is not much in this direction in Japan is not because of the "hostility to gerrymandering" or "the individual as a cog" but rather because of the "each person cooperates in eliminating gerrymandering because if you gerrymander to yourself, you will have endless work to do. In countries where this is not the case, there is an endless flow of work. In countries where this is not the case, even if an endless amount of work comes down to them, they don't try to eliminate it in a hurry (they usually make people wait).
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498641693431955456): Well, I don't feel that one is better than the other. I think it's not very efficient, but I think it's the manager's skill to do the right thing.
- > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498648341340909575): I just did a quick search and saw what came up, but I think it's rather close to the feel of the article here or something.

        - > Genrality itself is the source of job security for each person / The reason why there is little in this direction in Japan is... When you make yourself a genus, [[you will have unlimited work]], so each person cooperates in eliminating the genus.
            - Is there a cultural difference in whether you are "[[busy]]" or "[[make me wait]]" when a lot of work falls on you?
                - Is there a strong belief in Japan that [[customers should not be kept waiting]]?
    - > Is it because the practice of [[lifetime employment]] was so strong that each side was willing to help eliminate gerrymandering without fear of layoffs?
    - > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498672756090900480): I think this is part of the reason. In the case of individual contributors in the US and other countries, they use their individuality as a shield for job security, while negotiating and bargaining with management on compensation, workload, discretion, etc. As a result, overall efficiency may be sacrificed, and it's hard to say. I don't know...
    - > [dmikurube](https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1498677160915386368): This is the background behind the appearance of things like [[psychological safety]] and [[OKR]]. I think it is partly because if everyone starts such negotiations, the organization will not be able to function, and it would be nice to have a situation where everyone can talk to each other in good faith. I wonder if Japan was able to do that (in some aspects) when it had money, or...

- > [tnj](https://twitter.com/tnj/status/1498658695957266434): This is interesting, in foreign organizations [[transactive memory]] is often considered important, but isn't that a genus problem? I was wondering, but maybe it's not considered a problem to the extent that the word "genus" doesn't exist in the first place.
    - > [tnj](https://twitter.com/tnj/status/1498661630707572736): I wonder if it's because organizational change is typically faster than the problem of attribution. I've heard that there is often no concept of handover from a predecessor. I wonder if the documentation and policies are left in place because of the pursuit of consensus building on the spot, and if it's a side effect of reduced attribution.

- GPT3.5 translated both [[idiosyncrasy]] and [[independence]] as [[subjectivity]]. This has [[uncomfortable feeling]].
