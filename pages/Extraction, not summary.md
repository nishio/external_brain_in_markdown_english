title: "Extraction, not summary"
---

Often, when you tell an AI to "[[summarize]]", what comes out is a clichéd story that you've heard somewhere else.
- This means that my knowledge is beyond the level that AI comes up with thinking "this is about as good as it gets for the general public".

- I'm trying to figure out if the image prompt to [[selection (from a group)]] might be better.
- Example: "Pick out interesting points that are not often mentioned in existing documents."
    - Results: [[AI bosses on what keeps them up at night]].
