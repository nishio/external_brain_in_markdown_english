title: "A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation"
---

> Recently, retrieval-augmented text generation attracted increasing attention of the computational linguistics community. Compared with conventional generation models, retrieval-augmented text generation has remarkable advantages and particularly has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-augmented text generation. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation, and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks including dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks. Finally, it points out some important directions on top of recent methods to facilitate future research.

- (DeepL) In recent years, retrieval-enhanced text generation ([[Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation]]) has received considerable attention in the computational linguistics community. Compared to traditional generative models, Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation offers notable advantages, particularly in achieving state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks. The purpose of this paper is to provide a survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation. First, we highlight the general paradigm of Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation, and then review notable approaches for different tasks, including dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks. Finally, we point out some important directions on top of recent methods to facilitate future research.

It is from February 2022 (ChatGPT is November 2022).
