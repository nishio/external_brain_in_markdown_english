<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> The "Honji Suijaku" theory is a key concept in [[Japanese Buddhism]], particularly in the [[Esoteric Buddhist]] (or [[Vajrayana Buddhist]]) tradition.

The theory articulates a way of understanding the relationship between [[Buddhas]] (and [[bodhisattvas]]) of Buddhism and the native [[kami]] (deities or spirits) of [[Shinto]], which is the indigenous religion of Japan. According to this theory, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Buddhist pantheon are the honji - the true, original form - while the kami are their suijaku - their local, provisional form in Japan.

This concept allowed the two religious systems of Buddhism and Shinto to exist in a syncretic relationship in Japan. It suggested that when a Buddha or bodhisattva wished to save sentient beings in Japan, they would manifest as a kami, suitable to the culture and understanding of the local people.

Essentially, Honji Suijaku is a theory of religious syncretism that allowed Buddhism and Shinto to coexist and mutually reinforce each other in Japanese society. The theory shaped the religious landscape of Japan and played a major role in the development of its unique Buddhist practices and interpretations.
