title: "I want to reuse it while keeping it in its original condition."
---

    - I want to [[reuse]] the [[tags]] that I have lined up using the [[KJ method]], but it's inconvenient to do so on paper because I have to transcribe them.
- Physically reusing a sticky (= peeling it off and using it for another purpose) destroys the [[original placement]],
- The original arrangement can only be photographed and kept for now.
- I want to digitize and reuse without destroying the original.
