title: "Counting up the results of the operation → constructability determination"
---

> The object of counting is the result of an operation. When counting up the results of operations that have considerable degrees of freedom, we first consider how to determine what results can be constructed. (If the same result can be constructed from many sequences of operations, it is unlikely that the counting can be done without first considering the decision problem.) ) First, we leave counting and turn our thoughts to the decision problem.
