title: "Lower the hurdle of not knowing."
---

If you guess and pretend to know what you don't know, the hurdle of "[[I don't know]]" will be raised, and you will act as if you guessed what you don't know with low guess accuracy. I have to lower the hurdle by expressing that I don't know many things on a regular basis.

relevance
- Is not saying you don't know what you don't know a form of lying?
        - [[What is a lie?]]
    - Better to be a stupid uncle than a lying, know-it-all uncle.
