- 1: Introduction
    - IT advances are changing the rules of how we work.
        - Class notes are now digital and shared in real time.
    - With a shrinking population, time is running short and efficiency is needed.
        - Japan is a country with advanced issues. It faces a declining birthrate and an aging population first and foremost.
- 2: Demographic change
    - Population pyramid shows a large decrease in the population in their 20s in the future
        - Population of 20-somethings will decrease by about 15% in the 15 years from 2015 to 2030.
    - Six people will do the work of seven people, requiring a 17% efficiency improvement
        - A 17% increase in workload per person would require an hour of overtime each day or cutting three days off per month.
    - Konosuke Matsushita said, "Working an hour less and achieving more than ever before is progress in the way we work."
        - Ingenuity is needed to achieve this.
- 3: Efficiency through AI and IT
    - AI is IT in substance and is already close at hand.
        - AI is just a buzzword; the substance is information processing technology (IT).
    - Miura City Agricultural Cooperative: Work that used to take 8 hours can now be done in 1 second
        - Automates the creation of delivery schedules for shipments with proprietary algorithms
        - Work that used to take even experienced staff 5~6 hours is completed in 1 second.
    - Losing your job to AI is not a bad thing. We can use our time for other jobs.
        - Reduced staff workload, free time for sales, etc.
- 4: Changes due to technological advances
    - Technological advances change the definition of ability ([[Masahiko Inami]], Ph.)
        - A wheelchair that can go up the stairs would make the stairs barrier-free.
        - Example of alter-ego robot café: Enabling physically disabled people to serve customers
    - Greater scope for information sharing and a culture of openness and fairness
        - As information is shared, distrust of not sharing is created.
        - Computers don't forget because shared information doesn't disappear
    - Digital data can be both shared and kept confidential by setting access rights.
        - Minutes of management strategy meetings are now also shared.
        - Just restrict access to the parts that cannot be made public.
- 5: Changes in organizational structure
    - Increased information sharing leads to more decentralized decision making
        - It was the bottleneck that carried the information to management, who gathered the information and made the decisions.
        - Information sharing costs have dropped, so decision-making itself has become a bottleneck.
        - There has been a move to delegate decision-making authority to the field.
    - Creating a pluralistic organization that recognizes diverse work styles
        - Company and personal visions do not have to coincide. We can positively influence each other.
        - Recognizing 100 different ways of working for 100 different people
    - Cybozu case study: 100 people, 100 different ways to work. Flexibility to transfer after maternity leave.
        - Discussion ensued regarding transfer orders for employees returning from maternity leave.
        - Identical treatment is "equality," but adapting to individual needs is "happiness.
- 6: Review the rules of how you work.
    - Many of the rules for how we work are policy constraints set in the past
        - Companies that have been around for over 30 years are using old rules that were created back then.
    - Rules that do not fit the current situation should be changed. Let's find policy constraints.
        - Notice the expression "shall" in the conversation.
        - Consider whether it is a physical or policy constraint.
- 7: Issues in Japan
    - Chinese RoboCon "RoboMaster" Culture Makes Engineers Heroes
        - MVPs are awarded and animated.
        - Technical commentary will be given in between.
    - Japan Underestimates China Too Much
        - Low awareness in Japan that China is driving the global economy
    - Catchphrase: "Time is money, efficiency is life."
        - A hot topic in China.
- summary
    - IT-based work style reforms are required.
    - Need to review policy constraints and improve efficiency
