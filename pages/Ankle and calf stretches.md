A. The one you see most often.
- The back ankle was done in A2, but with variations.
- There are two patterns: pattern p, in which the state is knocked down and the knees are pressed with the chest, and pattern q, in which the arms are pressed with the arms.
- The left side feels, dare I say it, hard on the back of the heel, but it doesn't feel like it's stretched too much.
    - It was A2p, but when I changed it to A2q, it felt more like a stretch.
    - I assumed it would be better to put my upper body forward, but I guess not.
- On the right, I just put my chest against my thighs and it feels like my calves are stretching without any particular effort.
- There are two patterns: pattern x with the buttocks on the heels and pattern y with the crotch open.
    - A2 had buttocks on heels, A1 and A3 cannot, different
    - When the right leg is opened, the left is painful in the hip joint
    - Toe stand is a bit of a stretch and a bit of an either/or with that toe stretch.

B
- Conscious of maintaining posture and unable to roll forward much
- It looks better to me if the back foot is turned inward because it's easier when the back foot is turned outward.
    - Originally, the calf is taut on the outside.
- Stabilize your upper body by putting your hands on the wall or holding the sofa railing.
- Upper calf, just below the knee, feels stretched.
    - In A, it was the lower half, so maybe the muscles that act on it are different.

C
- Difficult to heel in this condition
- Variants of this include raising the catching position and raising one leg
    - C2 as presented in [Illustrated - "No Fatigue" and "No Fatigue" when you build muscle in the lower body.
    - C3 is the one introduced in [Bending the ankle causes the toes to bow.
        - I do this, but it works on the [[hamstring]], not the calf.

D
- There are two patterns: pattern 1, where only the toes are on the stairs, etc., and pattern 2, where the heel is on the floor with the block on the floor.
    - I thought D1 was stretched tight with weight, but when I compare the two, D2 seems to be more stretched.
    - Maybe D1's fear of having to maintain his posture so he doesn't roll over causes his muscles to exert themselves and try to contract stiffly.

Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles
    - [[triceps brachii muscle]]
    - One is [[soleus muscle]].
        - From the top of the lower leg
    - The other two are [[gastrocnemius muscles]] (lateral and medial)
        - From the femur
    - The end point is [[Achilles' heel]].

- In A, the knee is bent, the gastrocnemius is relaxed, and only the soleus is stretched
- In B, conversely, the knee is extended, so the gastrocnemius is propped up first.
    - Especially hard on the outside, habit of walking?

Based on this, I think A is the only one that contributes to solving the problem of "stiff ankles and difficulty maintaining posture when squatting"

relevance
    - [[Bending the ankle causes the toes to bow.]]
    - [[Ankle range of motion]]
