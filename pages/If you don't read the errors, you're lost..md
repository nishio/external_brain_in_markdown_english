Read the error message and you can fix it right away.

I don't even notice that the error message changes along the way, I just think "it's an error all the way through" and I'm trying to figure it out.
- It's even worse when they keep piling fixes on top of fixes.

> I said, "Did you read the error?"
> Junior "I haven't read it..."
> I said, "Why?"
> Juniors "..."
> I said, "No, no, no, I'm not stuffing..."
> "I'll read it."
> I said, "Yes, please."

> [@cero_t](https://twitter.com/cero_t/status/1565710911603544064): I don't know (to me) what kind of answer you were expecting when you asked "why", and if you're satisfied with "I'll read it" in response to "why", you still weren't going to ask why. I don't know what kind of answer you were expecting.
> I think in this vein I would go with "get into the habit of reading first" instead of "why".

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565846274607583232?s=21&t=xkM-na--Ur_KCrhDXthqEQ): totally agree with Tanimoto's opinion, and in response to "I got an error and it stopped working. Did you read the error? I'm not sure why he would say "Did you read the error? I thought he had read it, so I asked him "What kind of error? and if the answer is "I didn't read it...", it could be "Why? In that case, "I'll read it" would be "No, I'm not asking you that, I'm asking you why.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565854391105892354): I still think my case is "Error what?" I don't think it's a "why" to "I didn't read it", it's more like "read it then". I don't think the reason why the person didn't read the error at this time will help me to investigate the problem. I think that asking "why" at this time may have an intention other than error correction.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565855811267887106): "Then read it", "I closed it without reading it", "Then bring it up again", "I can't bring it up because I rewrote the source code", "Then I have no information. I can't help you, let's move on to the next point."
> I have a feeling this will happen.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565857825959874560): "I was trying to figure things out without reading the error message, and I lost my way. I can't go back because I didn't back up the source code.
> I knew it wouldn't be "why don't you read the errors" or "why don't you make backups".
