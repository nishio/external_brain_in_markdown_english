title: "False True/False Dichotomy"
---

- Special case of [False dichotomy
Falsely assuming that a statement is "either true or false" for a given statement.

Example: The
- Let f(x) = y. Is "f(x) is greater than 0" true? False?
- explanation
    - True if "f(x) is greater than 0 for some x
    - False if "f(x) is greater than 0 for all x
    - f(x) is greater than 0", where the range of x is unclear, cannot be determined as either true or false.
    - Statements of the real world are often unclear
        - In this example, it's attributed to [[quantifier]], but it's not limited to that.
