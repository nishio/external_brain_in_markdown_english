title: "Trying to solve multiple problems at once has a high probability of failure."

Even if "good ideas solve multiple problems at once" is true, it does not mean that "ideas that attempt to solve multiple problems at once" are "good ideas."
- An "idea that attempts to solve multiple problems at once" is NOT a "good idea."
- "An idea that solves multiple problems at once" is "a good idea."
- If it is successfully resolved, we will know after the fact that it is a good idea.
- Good ideas are rare and usually fail.

    - [[attempting two tasks simultaneously, accomplishing neither]]
    - [[Good ideas solve multiple problems at once.]]

We know after the fact that it is a good idea when it successfully solves the problem, but it usually fails because good ideas are rare.
