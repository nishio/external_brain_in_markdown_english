- In the process of creating the English translation on Scrapbox, I thought, "Let's assign unique numbers to the headings. The reason:.
    - It's hard to reference by page number when it's in digital form instead of a paper book.
    - Headings are natural to use as titles, but there are headings that appear multiple times, such as "Summary
- This was so useful that we did the same for the table of contents of this Japanese version
    - When there is a mention on Scrapbox, it will be a blue link
    - We have decided to put the added articles not included in the book version in the table of contents as additional content.
