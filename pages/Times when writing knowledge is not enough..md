title: "Times when writing knowledge is not enough."
---

- In [[2009 Leverage Memo Organizing]], the following line was found as [[Leverage memo]] in [[Dramatic One Paper]].
> How do we translate knowledge into earning money? First, you need to demonstrate that "I have the knowledge to create wealth." >> Write and publish your knowledge.

This has created value in my life for a long time, but I think it is starting to become obsolete as of 2023.
- The time is quickly approaching when "having knowledge" and "being able to write and publish knowledge" will not be enough.
- This is because LLM assistance lowers the cost of "writing knowledge".

It would still be correct for the time being to abstract one step and say, "I need to demonstrate in some way that I have power.
- What is the way to "demonstrate" this? is the question of the new era.
- Probably has to do with [Work to open up the forest of what has yet to be written.
- This idea is also related to Drucker's [Knowledge must be proven by deeds.

[[Proof of Power]]
- [[Proof of competence through results]]
