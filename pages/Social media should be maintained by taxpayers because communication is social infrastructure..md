from [[Meetup with Thomas Hardjono]]
- [[Social Media Financial Resources Issues]]
- Distortion of communication due to operation with [advertising revenue
- Model where Internet providers charge a flat rate
- Can't it be run by the national or local government?
    - I think it's part of the "minimum standards of living."
    - Compatible with the dissemination of information that is strongly related to the [[physical area]], such as local [[disaster prevention information]], event information, and exchange of goods.
    - [Social media should be maintained by taxpayers because [[communication is]] the infrastructure of society.]
            - [[communication]] is [[social infrastructure]] / [[social media]].
                - [[Infrastructure]] in [[community]]
