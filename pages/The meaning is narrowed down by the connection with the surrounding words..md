    - [[meaning]]
- Word meanings are ambiguous and the distribution of boundaries unclear
    - [[Connection to the surrounding vocabulary]] narrows the scope of its distribution
- The result of narrowing is that words with a wider [[semantic range]] are replaced by words with a narrower and clearer [[semantic range]].

concrete example
- The process of putting thoughts into words is being thrown to the individual's ability," along with "intellectual productivity needs to improve," which is a poor connection as it stands.
- "Individual ability," in other words, "intellectual productivity."
- Intellectual production is, in other words, "putting your thoughts into words."
- The "capability" is vague, but I've narrowed it down to what specifically it is.
- I'm sure "intellectual production" and many other kinds of production, too, but the meaning used here is clearer.


- [[Connection to the surrounding vocabulary]] :  [[context]]
