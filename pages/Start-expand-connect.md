- I think each of the three is a different capability.
    - A: Start something new where there is nothing.
    - B: Pouring energy into one theme and expanding it
    - C: Finding a connection between two things
- I have a slightly low B = [[fickle]].
    - I'm not particularly conscious of the C's, but I'm consciously increasing the A's.
    - So it must be C>A>B.
- Interesting analysis<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I might not be good at A myself.
        - I feel like I'm getting A's through marriage, child rearing, etc.
        - Do people influence you?
    - B is good at... I can't say I'm good at it, but I might tend to do the same thing all the time.
        - This is the metaphor for spreading the stain in the first place, and this is what you're consciously doing.
    - C is not conscious.

- ABC's.
    - A>B>C, I guess.
    - A is something I'm consciously working on.
        - but<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>not as much footwork as you two!
    - B is the best at feeling, but it's clumsy and becomes "not expansive enough for the time spent" or "stuck".
    - I am not good at C. I'm not good at situations that require me to think about connecting or applying two things.
        - Probably not suited to their characteristics.
        - [/sta](https://scrapbox.io/sta) I'm consciously trying to do this with my own scbo, but what a feeling of being left to my own devices. Or I am forcibly expanding two things that I see for the time being.

- It's interesting to see the three sides of the story.
