What is a "brocade"?
- Translation: "brocade imperial banner.
- Historical Origin: A flag indicating [[legitimacy]] fighting under the authority of the [[emperor]]. Raising this flag meant "[[dissenting]] = [[disloyalty]]" and became the strongest [[cause]].
- Figurative meaning: a banner of "[[absolute justice]]" that no one is likely to oppose. A convenient justification for dismissing arguments or mobilizing people.

Paraphrasing to be understood by English speakers
- "an unimpeachable banner of legitimacy" (a banner of legitimacy that is hard to refute).
- "a sacred banner to rally behind".
- Nearby idioms: wrap oneself in the flag (wrap oneself in a patriotic or other cause), take the moral high ground

Attention to nuance
- It is often said critically, not to undermine the value itself, but to refer to the behavior of waving it as a "[[flag]].
- It is similar to "grand justification," but the brocade has stronger connotations of authority and mobilizing power.

Historical episodes of the brocade (key points)
- Origin (Middle Ages)
    - Nishiki-no-Ohata = the sign of the official army of the Imperial Court ([[official army]]). It is a flag with the sun, moon, etc., on red brocade, and was first seen when it was given by Emperor Go-Toba during the Jokyu Rebellion (1221)**. ([Digital Archives](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/gallery/en/0000000695?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Behind the Scenes of Bakumatsu and Production
    - Prior to the first battle of the [[Boshin War]] and the [[Battle of Toba-Fushimi]] (1868), the original of a letter indicating that Toshimichi Okubo, Yajiro Shinagawa and others prepared Nishikibata at the request of Tomomi Iwakura has been confirmed (material held by Kyoto Rekisaikan). ([Asahi Shimbun](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASS2F41J7S1VPLZB015.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- "Formalization" of the Imperial Court
    - After the war began, the Imperial Court bestowed the Nishikibata and Setsutou (a ceremonial sword) on Prince Kasho of Ninnaji Palace. With this, the new government forces became a genuine "government army" and gained legal and psychological legitimacy. ([Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8C%A6%E3%81%AE%E5%BE%A1%E6%97%97?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Effects on the battlefield (Toba and Fushimi 1868/1/27-30)
    - The posting of the brocade and the division into "official forces" and "bandit forces" dealt a blow to the old shogunate side, and it is believed that Yodo, Tsu, and other clans switched sides and the war tilted to the side of the new government. ([Wikipedia [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%A5%E7%BE%BD%E3%83%BB%E4%BC%8F%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%AE%E6%88%A6%E3%81%84?utm_source=chatgpt](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%A5%E7%BE%BD%E3%83%BB%E4%BC%8F%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%AE%E6%88%A6%E3%81%84?utm_source=chatgpt) .com], [JapanKnowledge](https://japanknowledge.com/introduction/keyword.html?i=1878&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- However, the sway of the evaluation
    - Some commentators believe that the defeat was decided even before the arrival of the Nishiki banner, and that the banner itself did not directly determine the winner (equipment difference, morale difference, etc.). ([Japaaan](https://mag.japaaan.com/archives/218562?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
