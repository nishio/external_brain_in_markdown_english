title: "I don't understand it when I look at the spatial arrangement of the sticky notes."

When I show them the KJ method or Kozaneba's [[spatial arrangement]], they often say, "I don't understand.
- It's no surprise that spatial arrangement is not a format for communicating information to others, making it difficult to understand.
- KJ method is also used to make a final written or oral presentation [[one-dimensional text]].

- How well can others read the meaning from the spatial arrangement?
    - This is influenced by the degree to which the individual is accustomed to seeing information representations in the "two-dimensional arrangement" format
    - It's similar to someone who isn't used to reading a comic book that is divided into panels and doesn't know how to read it.
    - Similar to [[literacy]] meaning [[literacy rate]] in the sense that it is a trainable skill, without which the efficiency of inputting information expressed in that format is reduced.
