- [[Project]] [[Handicap]].
- If you keep touching one for too long, you won't be able to do many tricks.

Touching a little and making a little progress produces non-zero progress, but it's obviously slower than touching it firmly.
- This approach is good for [[things that you can win if you keep doing them lazily]], but not for [[things that are better done quickly]].
    - [Doing the wrong job quickly does not produce results.
