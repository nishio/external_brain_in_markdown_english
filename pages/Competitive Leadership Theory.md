[[Competition for leadership]]

Schumpeter's classic account of democracy in "[[Capitalism, Socialism, Democracy]]" explains in Chapter 21 that it is factually incorrect and proposes a new definition in Chapter 22
- The democratic method is an institutional arrangement for making political decisions, in which individuals win the right to decide through the competition of garnering the votes of citizens."

This was written in 1942-1950, so it does not take into account such trends as the transition to direct democracy through digital democracy.
- In a digital democracy, social institutions are forked and then legitimized by the choices of citizens. This process, in relation to the above statement, would be "the system wins the right to decide through the competition of gathering citizen attentions.
- [[social inovation legitimates governance]]


- Competing for [[leadership]] [[competition]].
