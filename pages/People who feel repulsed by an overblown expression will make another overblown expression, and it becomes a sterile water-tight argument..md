title: "People who feel repulsed by an overblown expression will make another overblown expression, and it becomes a sterile water-tight argument."

[[overreaching expression]] / [[fruitless argument]] / [[watering down]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387240962863243267): it seems to me that those who feel the backlash of one overreach are making another overreach and it's turning into a sterile water-boarding argument...
- > "It is always the enterprise companies and those around them who introduce agile as a startup way of doing things and say we should copy the startup way. They are not the ones who know firsthand how startups do things. And they take the liberty of developing an image of a cool startup, idealize it, and try to make their own development flow 'agile'."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387242737028661250): In the logic of "A is bad", "B is always A", and "therefore B is bad", the structure is that "A is bad" is obvious and the conclusion feels right, but "B is is always A" is a [[ludicrous generalization]].
- > "People who move to startups ask me, "Why don't they do Agile here? We're a startup, and they say, "That's not cool. That's not cool." That's the problem.
- > "The mistake in the first place was to try to force a goal on a development that had no goal."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387243634597142534): some of the past notes are relevant, but not exactly attributed, so let's just collect them and look at them and then think about the differences.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387243787039100933):  [[Generalize and attack conspicuously inferior people.]]
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387244089196699653): this is about "identifying an inferior and prominent member of a group of people with the group to which he or she belongs"
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387244525299535879): if some people from some town are murderers, it doesn't mean that all people from some town are murderers, right? often get it wrong.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387245308396986371):  [[Observation coverage issues]]
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387245550559383554): if "B is A" in the range of observation, it is strange to derive "B is always A" from it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387246352292220937): "[[generalize past bad experiences]]" was a link, but not a page.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387246870880129024): when we judge something from a past experience, when exactly was that experience? We tend to implicitly assume that nothing has changed since that experience, but is that assumption correct? The further into the past we get, the higher the probability that we are wrong.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387248416837697538): You're discussing whether "MyBigClass" is good or bad, but no, that class is not very cohesive to begin with, so there's no point in discussing the class as a whole. I think we need to clarify which part of the class we are talking about.
    - [[Discussing less cohesive concepts is futile.]]
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387248837018873859): the reason we are treating what should be discussed separately as a lump concept is because if your [[Cognitive Resolution]] is low, you won't be able to tell the difference.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387249561182240770): the title of the page is confusing, but this diagram seems to be the best for showing how some people perceive the same thing as "the same" and others as "different" [[One- dimensional version of cognitive resolution]].
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387249813901611009): this looks like I should make a page explaining this in more detail

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387251654894837761): you described it as "low cohesion" but should I have described it as "high connectivity"? [cohesion - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%90%E5%90%88%E5%BA%A6)

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387252730972938242): it is strange to treat X as if it were a monolithic concept when there is a word X that loosely encloses multiple concepts that are partially common or related
