title: "I want to search other people's Scrapboxes for vectors."

I want to do a vector search of Scrapboxes of people who don't publish a vector index.
- Not just Scrapbox, but blogs and the like, right?
- In the first place, not only digital books, but also paper books, right?
- We need a box that allows us to plug in anything we are interested in and make it vector searchable.

- I'd love to vector search Scrapbox for people who haven't created a vector index.
    - shokai or rashitamemo.
    - I think it could be made on the same principle as well backups are made on Github...
    - I mean, I wish my project was updated once a day.
    - And while we're at it, here's a summary of the updated section...
    - → [[Vector search across multiple projects]]
    - [[Porting to Python with GPT-4]]
    - It's done.
    - I guess we can now take data from anyone's project...
    - So what did I want to do with it (far away)?
    - I'm tired today, so let's call it a day.
- You can use this script to both automatically update your own project daily and take someone else's project, but they're two different things to begin with.
    - I don't need every day except for my own projects.
- It's convenient to be able to search vectors and ask questions, but it's inconvenient to have to sit in front of a computer.
    - The problem is that the index file is too big when trying to deploy it to use from a phone.
    - Hmmm, I guess that would be [[Pinecore]]...
- LLMs can submit search queries.
    - Experiments have actually been done to receive it and search Wikipedia.
    - Then, when you read Scrapbox and see the link notation, you can make the query "Read that link".
    - A system that utilizes the link structure of Scrapbox
