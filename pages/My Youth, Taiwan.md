- After reading [[Viewing of "My Youth in Taiwan"]], I bought the book and read it.
- I didn't know how to end the last scene, so I went to show them, and I cried, and [[Hakugei]] was like, "Hurry up and shoot the director! (the scene where the director says, "I can't wait to shoot the director!
- > At that moment, our power relations were reversed.
- interesting
- So up to that point, they were "objects of observation," and the director was in the position of filming them, interpreting them, cutting and pasting them, and creating a story.
- Here, Kanao's interpretation is that the action of Hakugei changed the story from "a tale of two people" to "a tale of three people" and "a tale of a group of people".
- > We are all independent people by nature, and each of us has our own place to go.
