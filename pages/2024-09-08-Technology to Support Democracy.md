Comment
- Signal control with AI, introduced into actual operation in 2023, I found it easily using Google.
    - [AI-based traffic signal control, traffic jam countermeasures in Tokyo, introduced by the Metropolitan Police Department for the first time in Japan - Nihon Keizai Shimbun](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUE279YP0X20C23A9000000/)

- I have added Audrey Tang's video to the slides, which was only mentioned verbally during the live show.

People interested in using TTTC People interested in broad listening
- It would be a waste to dissipate it by saying, "It's OSS, so look at the English repository."
- Japanese do not know each other and cannot communicate in Japanese.
- It would be nice to have some kind of place in Japan where people interested in broad listening can get together.
- It would be an online community, not a physical one.
- Nishio's idea of using the Plurality Japanese translation community -> I can secure my attention, but I feel that the project objectives are too blurred.
- Create a channel like proj-broadlistening on Code for Japan's Slack

- Create proj-broadlistening in Code for Japan Slack✅.
- Create a project page in Notion✅.
    - Public page [Broad Listening](https://code4japan-community.notion.site/b018bcee86cb4e03829cade5cb62cee6)
    - Page for editing [Broad Listening](https://www.notion.so/code4japan-community/b018bcee86cb4e03829cade5cb62cee6)
- Google Docs [FAQ draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWbqwWgNKQgBU1RFIwG64jMIJe5qNXhEYvWK4Jh6H2M/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Preparation ✅
    - I'm going to call on you to unearth and transcribe what I've answered so far ✅.
- Tweeted.

Broad Listening to "That Figure"
- Originally written to illustrate the story that LLM can change organizational structure.
        - [[Changes in organizational structure brought about by LLM]]
- Published in the special issue of 2023/8 of the Information Processing Society of Japan.
        - [[Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.]]
- He's more popular than he thought, so he made it CC-0 and free to use.

Talk to the city
- It's not a silver bullet.
- One of the many attempts by people around the world to improve society through software
    - [[AI Objectives Institute]]
- What kind of improvement is needed here?
    - It would be good to talk about something along the lines of, "We need a mechanism to encourage quality discussion."
