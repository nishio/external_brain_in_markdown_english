title: "I want to write a book in Scrapbox"
---

When [[writing (e.g. as a profession)]] a book in Scrapbox, writing long sentences on a single page kills the advantages of Scrapbox, but if the manuscript is spread over several pages, it is difficult to get the "feel of reading on paper. Therefore, it would be better to write each section on a separate page and then embed it in the table of contents page.

- Chapter headings
    - Clause heading X
        - ↑Up with special deco-#.
        - ←I want to retrieve and render the contents of the page titled "Section Heading X" in this section.
    - implementation method
        - There doesn't seem to be an API to get what has already been rendered.
        - Use a Chrome extension to get the whole page, wait until it renders, and then extract the DOM of the body part?

    - [[intellitech writing process]] Failure to use Scrapbox for writing
- This time, everything is being done in Scrapbox, from the first stage of editorial communication.
    - And the above problem is still a bottleneck.
    - [[Scrapbox is a purifier of ideas]], so I wrote down some ideas.
