title: "Forming Public Opinion on the Internet is a Silver Democracy Mitigation Strategy"
---

The similarity between this and the fact that Japanese people tend to be less motivated to go to the global market because they can do business only in the domestic Japanese market, and Japanese people tend to be less motivated to communicate in English because they can get enough reactions just by communicating in Japanese.

And from the other side, it looks like "a phenomenon in which players who have the additional cost of entering the market avoid entering the market, thereby lowering their weight in the market beyond their ability".
- This is [[barriers to entry]].
- From the point of view of existing players in the market, the existence of that [[barrier]] is desirable.

If we apply this to [[public opinion formation]] on the Internet
- Advantageous for youth by making it difficult for older people to participate in public opinion formation on the Internet.
- This is favorable to the youth, so there is no incentive for the youth to improve
- Potentially beneficial overall, as it can alleviate [[silver democracy]] problems due to high elderly headcount ratios
