> Master & slave is one of the strategies in [[prisoner's dilemma]], one of the games in [[theory of games]]. It defeated [[strategy of retaliating against an adversary]] and its variants, which had been considered the most powerful until then, and won the championship.
[Master and slave - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%BB%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%A8%E5%A5%B4%E9%9A%B7)

- The team will cooperate in a pre-determined sequential pattern, and produce five to ten betrayals to determine whether or not the opponent is a member of their team.
    - If it is determined that the other party is not a peer
        - Always try to lower your opponent's score as much as possible by always producing a betrayal.
    - If the other party is determined to be a peer
        - Of the programs, those that are assigned the role of slaves always produce coordination.
        - Of the programs, those that are assigned the role of master always produce betrayal.

It is a play that first identifies whether the players are peers who share a strategy, and then plays "aggregate wealth to a particular program" among peers. The objective function of "winning" is [[non-linear]], which means that it is more advantageous to aggregate wealth than to have the entire program increase its wealth on average.
