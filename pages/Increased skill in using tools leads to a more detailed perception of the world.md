- I don't know how to say this, but I feel like [New doors opened.
- Until now, my [[image output]] was only a [[schematic]] with black markers on a white background for explanations.
    - A monochrome world?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I had tried [[sketch]] while looking at the real thing, but then I thought, "Why not just use a photo?
- There were no images in the virtual world of my brain.
        - There was no [Non-existent world to be depicted
    - There was no visual [[Ability to imagine]] the non-existent world.
- After a while of doing "create an image with [[Drawing AI]] → judge whether it is good or bad", it was like "I put water pressure on a clogged pipe and it started to flow".
    - I don't know how to say this.
    - When you haven't recognized it before and are thinking [[What I couldn't move, I can now move...]].
        - I had a feeling similar to when I started playing sports.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - Clearly perceive the presence of previously unrecognized body movements and muscles, and try new ways to move them.
                - This is fun.
            - It could be when using a ball, shinai, stick, or other equipment.
                - that one's [[somesthesis]] is elongated through tools, such as
        - Indeed. Lately.[[draw-in]] をしてて「なるほど、これが [[Kegel muscle]] か」となった<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

                    - Mr. Sekihara...] told me that you have to be aware of what part of your body you are working on in order to train effectively.
                    - Mr. Sekihara=person
                    - Same with running, etc.
        - To use a [[crane game]] analogy, it is as if you had only been able to move the crane left and right, but then you realized there was a button to move it in the depth direction, and you thought, "If I press this button, it will move back and forth! It's like "I can push this button and it moves back and forth!
- I'm awfully curious what you're talking about.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I've done my best to verbalize it, but if that doesn't get the message across, then it's "just sprouting" and I think the only thing I can do is "wait until it grows up.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

        - When I say "increase the resolution," I feel uncomfortable because I imagine a situation where something that was originally dimly visible is now clearly visible.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - This one is closer: [[Fog of Literacy]].
            - It's like something that wasn't visible at all is starting to appear dimly.
        - 「 [[move (e.g. feeling)]] 」ことに重点がありそうな予感<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I learned that I could move areas I wasn't using.
                - Sensation of moving muscles in muscle training, sports, etc.
                - Likewise, did you know that there is an area of the mind that "imagines images of the virtual world" that we have never been aware of?
            - When I moved it, it moved more, interesting! It's like<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
                - This is what I expect from [[InstaChord]] (aside).
                - good prospect (e.g. marriage, business)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I think this is pretty close.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Maybe a new form of self-expression.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I first wrote an application that can play chords as a way to study [[musical (music) theory]].
    - After that, he learned [[electronic construction]] and made [[RakuChord]] as hardware.
    - In the process, I realized that playing the piano with both hands (if you play it in a kindergarten teacher way) doesn't seem to be a superb skill.
        - There might have been a sense of [New doors opened.
        - I figured this out recently.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - And [[InstaChord]] is having fun.
- An example of how learning electronics in the first place opened new doors.
    - [[AHA experience]] I remember that term too.
    - This one is more like a light "awareness"?
    - Since I bought a [[3D printer]], I think I've started to look at plastic products as something to be made.
        - I don't have any knowledge of [[Injection Molding]] yet, though,

There is a higher level of abstraction and a lower level of abstraction.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/はるひ/icon' alt='/villagepump/はるひ.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The former is "a new door (opens)" and the latter is its content, which is concerned with [[new door opened#63ad9797aff09e00000cdd6c]].
    - (I'm still curious about the latter.)
- Interpreted again, it's like a GPU in the head that started to move?
    - It was about on-board.

The boundaries are becoming clearer and clearer with all the different opinions.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- ⭕️I put water pressure on the clogged pipe and it started flowing.
- ⭕[["perceive the muscles clearly and try new ways of moving them"]].
- ⭕[["Notice that there is a button to move it in the depth direction]].
- ❌increase resolution.
- ⭕There seems to be an emphasis on "moving it".
- ❌like a GPU in the head?".
- I don't feel that the performance of anything existing has been improved, but rather that new features have been added.
    - Not 1 became 10, but 0 became 1.
    - Both are increasing in number, so to someone else it might be, "Isn't that an improvement in performance?" to others.
    - But as for him, he does not feel that the performance has improved. because he was not aware of it when he was 0, so there is no comparison.
- It has to do with "moving it."
    - Cannot be moved at 0.
    - I'm now at 1 so I can move it.
    - Maybe by moving it, it will increase to 10.

- There is a sense in which the skill of illustration does not grow linearly with the amount of practice, but rather in steps in the extreme, and this is something that others have often said
    - Various people express it in terms of being able to do that when they become "aware."
    - Could it be something close?

- As a team member who knows programming and PC/software customization <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/> and not all of it, even in my daily work, I see a significant difference in the way I work and approach my work.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/sta/icon' alt='/villagepump/sta.icon' height="19.5"/>I thought that the "Mere Old Man" could see the details because he knew
    - Knowing tool X, how to use X to process, can we look at it in a target way?

            - > Heidegger divided the concept of existence into [[material]] and [[instrumental]] existence, and considered the use of instrumental existence [Skills disclose the world.
            - > Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, believed that the movement orientation of the subjective body provides an understanding of the world
            - > Heidegger considered tools to be separate from the human body, whereas Merleau-Ponty considered the human body itself to be a tool, and even when artifacts are used as tools, they are subjectively perceived as an extension of the body
    - from [[new door opened#63af0a4eaff09e0000108392]].
        - ⭕[["perceive the muscles clearly and try new ways of moving them"]].
        - ⭕[["Notice that there is a button to move it in the depth direction]].
        - ❌increase resolution.
        - ⭕There seems to be an emphasis on "moving it".
    - This is a case where our understanding of the world is being promoted not by "increasing cognitive resolution" but by "improving our skills in using tools."
        - I wrote "Merleau-Ponty-like vocabulary," but I didn't need to distinguish between Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty on this one.
        - Can we say "phenomenological vocabulary?" Would that be the opposite, or would Husserl get mixed up and become something different...

    - [[Real-life examples of the process of deepening understanding]]
    - This is a description of the process of increasing cognitive resolution in the process of playing the game "Guess my current location by looking at Google Street View"
    - I had the feeling that it was a little different than what we're talking about here.
    - Perhaps it's the difference between "increasing cognitive resolution" and "improving skill in using tools."
