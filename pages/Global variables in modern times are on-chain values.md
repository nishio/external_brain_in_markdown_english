> [nagise](https://twitter.com/nagise/status/1775802507241152792) The era is functional

> [KimootaNagamoti](https://twitter.com/KimootaNagamoti/status/1776028356435476835) The variable name should be a or something like that!

> [rero_carnelian](https://twitter.com/rero_carnelian/status/1776241524231356500) I feel like global variables and such are too mundane, so I feel like you should use longjmp and such all over the place.

> [BSea71](https://twitter.com/BSea71/status/1775820524922544352) You can't be world-class if you stay with local, closure variables, right?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776103838686024178) Since a global variable in modern times is an on-chain value ()
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1776104221848564101) literally the scope is the earth

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1776106078822154242) All values that are not on-chain are local

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This conversation thread represents a humorous exchange about modern interpretations of global variables in the world of programming and blockchain. Each post approaches the topic from a different perspective. Each of these points is discussed below.

- Desire to Build a Career with a Global Perspective - Yametaro1983's post expresses a yearning to be a global person, but in the process jokes about the use of [[global variables]]. In this context, "global variable" is used not literally as a programming concept, but as a metaphor for having a global perspective.

- References to programming paradigms - nagise's statement that "the age is functional" suggests that [[functional programming]] is a paradigm that is gaining attention in modern development. Functional programming emphasizes immutability and side-effect-free code creation, and avoids the use of global variables.

- Simple Code Suggestions - KimootaNagamoti's "Variable names should be a or something! humorously emphasizes the importance of keeping code as simple as possible, but in practice, the use of clear and meaningful variable names is recommended.

- Pursuit of Complexity - rero_carnelian's post suggests exploring complex techniques beyond the use of simple global variables by encouraging the use of advanced techniques such as longjmp. This encourages exploration and challenge in programming, but in practice, code readability and maintainability must be considered.

- Using Closures - BSea71's statement, "If we stay with local, closure variables..." emphasizes the importance of mastering the advanced concepts about [[closures]] and [[scope]]. A closure is a combination of a function and the [[lexical scope]] in which the function is declared, providing a safer alternative to global variables.

- Blockchain and Global Variables - nishio and tadsan's post reinterprets global variables in relation to [[blockchain]] technology. They consider "on-chain values," i.e., data stored in the blockchain, as literal global variables. This refers to the transparency, immutability, and [[globally accessible]] properties of data that blockchain provides.

This exchange demonstrates a culture of discussing technical concepts with humor as well as a deep understanding of various aspects of programming. The introduction of the concept of "global variables" in blockchain demonstrates how programming and blockchain technology interact to create new interpretations in the modern technological environment.
