It had been languishing for about a month just before light blue, but [[ARC106]] finally made it to light blue.

I don't usually look at it much, but you can see various stats on AtCoder Problems. So far, they have done 151 problems. I've been doing this for about 5 months, so I'm averaging 1 question a day.

The heat map shows that there is a lot of activity in June and July, and then mainly on weekends.

- I wrote in a previous post, "[[Verbalization of Awareness]] continues
    - I feel like [[crystallization]] is happening slowly, with multiple issues reacting at different times.
    - The name "verbalization of awareness" is not appropriate.
        - > To name the technique used in the deformation process and make it a tag on Scrapbox.
        - 「 [[Name the transformation technique]] 」
    - This definitely contributes to rate improvement.
    - The reason why I was able to solve D in [[ARC106]] this time is because I was able to retrieve and use three techniques from my brain drawer: [[Half of the queue]] → [[binomial theorem]] → [[Change the order of addition]].
    - Naming them provides a handle for "getting them out" [[Concept Handles]].

- Began to maintain the library.
        - [[Snippet libraries that can be tested]]
    - In this case, [[UnionFind]] and [[Combination in mod P]] calculations are taken from the library.

- Solved learning contests.
    - [[Educational DP Contest]]
            - Contest about [dynamic programming
        - I did this around July when there was a lot of activity.
    - [[AtCoder Library Practice Contest]]
        - Contests on various algorithms added to the [AtCoder Library

- He was stepping in front of the light blue.
    - The "contents of the toolbox" have increased with the above study and library maintenance.
        - However, I felt that it was weak to look at a problem and attribute it to a solution method or algorithm, saying, "If I use that tool like this, I can solve it.
        - How can [[Power of Attribution]] be developed?
        - I started [[landing practice]] with the purpose of exploring how to train it.
        - This is simply put: "Instead of looking at a problem and writing a program, write a solution in natural language.
        - I've only been at it for about 4 days, but it feels good.
        - The detailed verbalization of "what we thought" clarifies what we misunderstood, missed, or didn't realize.

- What we no longer do
    - Numba, Cython and Numpy.
        - If you think carefully about your current position, it is more important to arrive promptly at a solution of the appropriate order than to speed up such a process!
        - This type of acceleration is not appropriate as an investment of time.
        - So I'll just use PyPy3 until PyPy3 says "nothing is wrong, but I can't AC because the language is too slow".
    - Aiming for full completion after the contest.
        - The ones who try to solve all the problems they couldn't solve after looking at the explanations.
        - For a while, "solving it all" had become an objective, but was that an objective? I reconsidered.
