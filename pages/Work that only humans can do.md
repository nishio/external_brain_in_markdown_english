title: "Work that only humans can do"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643806421136605186) cleaning up spilled coffee, "a job only humans can do."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643806928697720833) I'm the one who spilled it. I'm creating jobs! Amazing! ()

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643808068030046208) Taking care of infants will be a job that "only humans can do" and that humans can feel they are "contributing to the world" until soft robots become widespread. I wonder if this will be the case...
