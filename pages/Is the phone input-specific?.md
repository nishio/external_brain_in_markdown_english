title: "Is the phone input-specific?"
---

Q: Are smartphones good for output? I feel like it's a tool that specializes in input.
A:
It depends on what you imagine the "[[output]]" to be.
For example, if you think that "writing long sentences is easier on a PC than on a smartphone," you are implicitly assuming by the term "output" that "[[Write long sentences]].
If you don't limit your output to long-winded writing, I can think of many use cases where a smartphone is better suited, such as "voice typing on the phone while on the move to share an idea with others immediately," or "taking a picture of something you saw or scribbling on a whiteboard or restaurant paper napkin and sending it. .

Also, if you think that a PC is better suited than a smartphone for writing long sentences, what characteristics make it better suited?
For example, among the several input options - keyboard input, flick input, voice input - is it possible that the keyboard is simply the one you are most accustomed to?

Personally, I use a PC instead of a smartphone for writing long sentences because of the wide screen. A wider screen means more information can be displayed at a glance. However, the dichotomy of using a PC and a smartphone is [[choosing the wrong two options]]. When doing KJ on paper, it is often necessary to list information that is equivalent to eight sheets of A4 paper, and not many people have monitors that are large enough for eight sheets of A4 paper. (It is not impossible to use multiple monitors at present, especially for day traders whose results are greatly affected by the amount of information they can display.)
