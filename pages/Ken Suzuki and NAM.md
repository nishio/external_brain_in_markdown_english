<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following is what we know about the relationship between Ken Suzuki and Yukito Karatani.
- As of 2001, Ken Suzuki contributed an article titled "[[Net Community Currency Tamashii]]" to a book titled "[[NAM Generation]]. [[NAM]] is a movement led by Yukito Karatani.
- When Tsuneichi Toyama once wrote on Twitter that Ken Suzuki was from Yukito Karatani's NAM movement, he was rebuked by Ken Suzuki himself, who said, "No, I am not from NAM, I was just helping.

In other words, Ken Suzuki was involved in some way in the NAM movement led by Yukito Emaya and has contributed to books on NAM, but he does not consider himself a "NAM graduate," saying that he only "helped" with NAM. NAM may have had a certain influence on the formation of Mr. Suzuki's thought, although he was not a core member of NAM.
