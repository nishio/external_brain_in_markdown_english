Should the right to vote be allowed from age 0? Generate a third force opinion that differs from both sides of the issue, pro and con.
ChatGPT
Pros:.
Allowing the right to vote from the age of 0 will ensure that the views of all citizens are reflected. By allowing parents and guardians to vote by proxy, policies are promoted that take into account the interests of future generations, making society as a whole more inclusive. In addition, interest in politics from an early age promotes active civic participation in the future.

Opposition:.
The right to vote from age 0 is impractical, and granting the right to vote to those who do not have the ability to actually make political decisions undermines the fairness of the system. Furthermore, allowing parents to vote by proxy may be a breeding ground for fraudulent votes. The right to vote should be limited to those with mature judgment.

Third Force Opinion:.
To increase the political involvement of citizens, regardless of age, a tiered education program and expanded voting rights should be considered. For example, allowing people as young as 16 years old to vote and strengthening political education for younger generations will improve the political awareness of society as a whole. This will ensure a society in which all generations are fairly represented in the future.

Each faction must refute the other.
ChatGPT
Response from the proponents to the opponents:.
The interests of future generations can be protected by introducing a system in which parents vote by proxy, rather than the 0-year-olds themselves making the decisions, as the opponents argue. Concerns about vote fraud can be addressed through rigorous monitoring and transparency. The key is to build a more inclusive society by reflecting the voices of all citizens.

Response from opponents to proponents:.
In order to build an inclusive society, as proponents argue, only those who actually have the ability to make decisions should be given the right to vote; giving 0-year-olds the right to vote could lead to an over-influence of parental opinion and undermine democracy in the true sense. In addition, the risk of fraudulent voting cannot be completely eliminated, and fairness is shaken.

Third Force to Pros and Cons:.
While I sympathize with the ideals of the proponents, giving the right to vote to 0-year-olds is extreme. As a first practical step, we should strengthen political education for young people and consider introducing the right to vote from the age of 16. On the other hand, while I understand the opposition's insistence on limiting it to those who are capable of making decisions, a step-by-step approach is necessary to raise the political awareness of society as a whole. Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance so that all citizens are fairly represented.

If you are an adult to begin with, do you have the capacity to make decisions?
ChatGPT
Being an adult does not necessarily mean that all people have sufficient capacity to make decisions. Although adults are generally considered to have legal rights and responsibilities, actual decision-making capacity varies from person to person. Because education, experience, and access to information affect this ability, some adults do not have sufficient judgment. On the other hand, young people are more likely to make wise decisions if provided with sufficient education and information. Therefore, not only age but also the quality of education and information provided should be considered when it comes to voting rights.

Wouldn't it be unfair to change voting rights based on education level?
ChatGPT
Indeed, varying voting rights based on education level could be perceived as unfair. It is a fundamental principle of democracy that all citizens have an equal right to vote, and there is criticism that restricting voting rights on the basis of different educational opportunities or levels of education for different people is not fair.

While education is important, the right to vote is a fundamental right as a citizen, and through its exercise one can participate in and influence society. Therefore, the prevailing view is that all adults, regardless of education level, should be granted the right to vote equally. At the same time, it is important that efforts be made to enhance education and information provision so that all citizens have access to appropriate information. This will enable more people to cast an informed vote.

If "it is a fundamental principle of democracy that all citizens have an equal right to vote," then isn't it unequal to deprive citizens below a certain age of the right to vote?
ChatGPT
At first glance, not allowing citizens below a certain age to vote may seem unequal. However, in many countries, placing an age limit on the right to vote is reasonable from the standpoint of decision-making ability and maturity. Some reasons are listed below.

Maturity of judgment:.
Young people are generally considered to have less mature judgment than adults. Their understanding of and sense of responsibility for social, economic, and political issues are not fully developed.

Legal and social criteria:.
Age limits on voting rights are often consistent with other legal rights and obligations (e.g., driver's license age, drinking age, age of majority, etc.) and serve as a standard for social consistency.

Role of Education:.
Young people first need time to acquire basic knowledge of society and politics through basic education. For this reason, the idea is not to allow them to vote during their education period.

However, there are arguments against this as well. For example, there is the argument that by providing sufficient education and information, regardless of age, even young people will be able to make appropriate decisions. There is also the opinion that the opinions of the younger generation should also be reflected in politics.

In conclusion, age limits are based on social consensus and are not necessarily absolute. Different countries and regions have different ideas and approaches, and different cultures and values may lead to different conclusions.

As a fourth opinion, what about a separate ballot by minors, to be used as a reference opinion for adults when they vote?
ChatGPT
Fourth opinion:.
One approach is to conduct a separate vote by minors and use the results of that vote as a reference opinion for the adult vote. This approach has several advantages.

Improving Educational Effectiveness:.
The experience of minors in actual voting will increase their interest in politics and promote future civic participation. In conjunction with school education, this program provides an opportunity for students to deepen their knowledge of politics and social issues.

Reflecting the views of future generations:.
By referring adults to the opinions of minors, it becomes easier to reflect the problems and hopes of future generations in policymaking. This enables policymaking from a long-term perspective.

Deepening Democracy:.
Democracy functions more healthily when the younger generation is actively involved in politics. Diverse opinions will be respected and the views of society as a whole will be reflected in a more inclusive manner.

While this method does not directly affect actual policy making, it does incorporate the opinions of young people into the adult decision-making process, thereby helping to achieve a more balanced society. In addition, minors themselves feel that their opinions have an impact on society, which increases their motivation to participate in politics.

On the other hand, there are some issues with this proposal. It is necessary to establish a concrete mechanism for how much influence the position as a reference opinion will have and how it will be used as a reference in practice. It is also important to establish a fair and transparent process for minors to cast their votes.

Such a system would complement the current voting system and would require much discussion and consideration when implemented. However, as a new form of democracy, it is an idea worth considering.
