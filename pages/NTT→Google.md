The author retired from [[NTT Laboratories]], where he worked for six years.
- Good points about NTT Laboratories:
    - Attracting the best and the brightest
    - Good research facilities and budgets.
    - Understands the importance of basic research
    - Evaluate diverse outcomes
    - Good working environment (discretionary work system, law-abiding employees)
    - Salary is above average and there is rent assistance.
- Reason for resignation:
    - a) Limited salary growth.
        - Significant salary increases are not possible without management positions.
        - Does not fit the author's life plan.
    - b) Desperation for the internal environment
        - Excessive and inefficient security measures
        - Management with low IT literacy
        - Inefficient work environment (old PC, little memory)
        - Unions are reluctant to improve treatment of certain jobs

The author has moved to Google's SEARCH team.
Overall, the author feels that NTT Laboratories is an excellent research environment, but has issues with career growth and keeping up with the latest technology.

> From my experience of moving from N to G, N was by far the most [[freedom]], including [[discretion]] in [[Research Themes]]. I could do [[MeCab]]. I was advised (I think) that if I did purely my own research and development, it would be in academia. In other words, it is not a simple matter of [[reward]] being low and therefore no good, but it is necessary to consider the work, [[discretion]], and [[degree of freedom]] as well.
