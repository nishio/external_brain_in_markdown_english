Importance of trial and error and recommendations for sharing
Engineers.[[試行錯誤の過程を共有]]し、透明性を持って行動する重要性についてのツイートのまとめ。特に、この過程を公開することや新しい技術の取り組みにおいて初期の「[[試行錯誤フェーズ]]」を設けることが強調されている。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - I completely agree with the expression "[[Trial and error is hard to see...]]" in "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production."
        - When you teach people things, it's easy to tell them the answer or the solution, but it's hard to tell them the [[trial and error]] of finding it.
            - It's many times longer than just saying the answer.
            - If you're used to it, you can skip a lot of things, but not for the person you're teaching.
        - I'll have to leave the results of my trial and error and how it went, for example, in a commit message.

            - Because of this, when you are doing trial and error on OSS (with the aim of eventually committing), you should not do it alone, but raise the issue in ML or issue first [[trial and error in a visible place]].
            - And not only trial and error, but quality improvement is equally invisible. It is still a good idea to do it in the open.
                - That's the part you don't see in the git log.
                    - I can do a reverse lookup if the issue# is attached. lkml has a URL attached these days, so I can do a reverse lookup from [http://lkml.org,](http://lkml.org,) but the trap is that I have to attach a link to the previous series in the cover email to get to it.

            - I try to create a "trial and error phase" at the beginning of a project where I have discretion, especially when using new frameworks, middleware, or packaged software.
            - As a rule, anything made for trial during that period is discarded.
            - Until you learn the etiquette, [[copying of a sutra]] or trial and error is necessary.
            - In reality, there are many projects in which I have no discretion, so I'm not always on the cutting edge, but if I do something new without clear trial and error, the design or implementation that I initially created by misunderstanding something will become a very big liability later on.

[[Trying something new without trial and error is a huge liability]].
- [[trial and error]]
