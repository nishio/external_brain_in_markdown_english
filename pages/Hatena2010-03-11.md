I went to the tax office and filed my tax return. I'm not good with paperwork, so I wanted to get feedback on the spot if there were any mistakes. While waiting in line to file, I realized I hadn't stamped my seal. I pressed it. I submitted it. I was confronted with the fact that I didn't write my address. I apologized and wrote it down. He asked, "Is this OK?" I can't judge that, so I'll let you know if there are any problems." Boom! I can't make a decision! Next year, I'll send it by mail.
