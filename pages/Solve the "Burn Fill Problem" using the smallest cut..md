[https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/shindannin/project-selection-problem](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/shindannin/project-selection-problem)
- [[bury in the fire]] 　 [[minimum cut]]
Burn bury?
- Multiple sub-problems, choices, and costs depending on the choice.
- There is a dependency on the choice of subproblems.
- If the number of problems is about 20, you can solve it with a full search.
    - It can be solved by attributing it to the smallest cut when it's 10000 or something.
How is it different from →DP?

> I think it's time for the concept of 'burn fill' to go away. Because if you remember the form of Project Selection itself, it's a blink of an eye.
