Don't work in parallel while waiting for [[autonomous AI]].

> [shokai](https://x.com/shokai/status/1956645657558847611) Doing another development task in parallel while waiting for Deep Research is too much [[brain load]] and should be prohibited.

The same thing that almost made me sick using [[Devin]] in parallel.

relevance
    - [[Work intensity is too high if we work in accordance with AI.]]
    - [[Painful problem when Devin tasks are parallel.]]
- [[It's hard when you have several AI assistants running in parallel.]]
    - [[The problem of overdoing programming with AI agents is too much of a burden and makes me sick.]]
    - [[Using lots of Devin in parallel efficiently punctures the head.]]
    - [[Push yourself into cognitive overload and observe]]
    - [[Meta-awareness of one's intellectual production process while applying high-intensity load]].
