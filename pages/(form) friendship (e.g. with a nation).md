> A concept proposed by C. Schmidt in [[The concept of politics]] (1927). He believes that the essence of politics is fundamentally expressed in a friend-enemy conflict situation. Criticizing modern [[pluralistic state theory]] for its inability to clearly define the enemy of the state and thus delaying the determination of the problem, he argued that the real enemy of the state, i.e., the communist forces, needed to be wiped out in order to solve the political chaos in Weimar Germany. For him, the essence of politics appears in the exceptional situation [[war]]. This concept was inherited by [[Nazism]] and eventually became the justification for [[Hitler's]] dictatorship.

- > While these statements may at times provoke a look of disdain, it is natural. Over the past decade, the conflict between the two factions has developed and the rift of clashes, hatred, and distrust has deepened. These are not easy to resolve, but they are not impossible. By fully acknowledging the value of both sides and accepting reasonable concerns and criticisms from both sides, we have the opportunity to clarify fundamental differences and explore ways to move beyond them. So let us take the initiative to raise these grievances and accept the criticisms that generate widespread interest. Even if the current evidence does not fully support these criticisms. Let us attempt to harmonize the framework of extremes of conflict and create opportunities for democratic technological improvement.
