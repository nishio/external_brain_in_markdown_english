- A friend of mine found a partner in this game and got married.
- I felt that the "communal garden management" was an emulation of a household, [[signalling]] whether or not a person is capable of taking care of the household chores.

Very interesting observation. I think the case of Mr. Nishio's friend is a good example of a "game-like collaboration = microcosm of the family" that functioned as a "game-like collaboration = microcosm of the family". To summarize, we can interpret it this way.

Why the "communal garden" is an emulation of the home
1. continuous joint management
    - In the love garden, we need to continue to grow the "garden" together.
    - Logging in daily to water, harvest, decorate, etc. = similar to daily chores and maintenance of life.
2. division of roles and cooperation
    - If one of them neglects the garden, the garden will be destroyed.
    - Naturally, we can see "how much mame the other party is" and "how to divide the burden.
    - → Function as a simulation of home life.
3. consistency of behavior signals
    - Signaling whether or not [[someone]] "takes care of you a little bit every day" = [[someone]] with whom you can maintain a long-term relationship.
    - Show [[by your actions]], not by profile statements or verbal promises, whether you are a person who can do household chores with aplomb.

Differences from other matching apps
- Regular matching apps → text- and photo-based impression formation
- Koi Garden → Continuous action-based impression formation
    - Test-playing is available to "see if we can live together."
    - Growing a garden together" has become "the prototype for a small communal life."

Perspectives on Social Significance
- From a behavioral economics perspective, the system is observable in the "mameness," "responsibility," and "cooperativeness" of the partner.
- Simulating a "miniature family" in a digital environment could play a role in reducing mismatches.

Nishio's point is the essence of "[[visualizing]] sincerity through action," which is hidden in the design philosophy of Koi Garden.


relevance
    - [[Proof by Actions]]
    - [[Long-term relationship with the same person]]
