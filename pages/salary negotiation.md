- It's a mystery to me how more and more people misunderstand that "[[negotiations]]" is not a matter of one party following what the other party decides, but rather a process of parties seeking a mutually favorable conclusion by informing each other, so that the moment we start talking about salary negotiations, one party unilaterally decides something. Hey.
- I wonder if the difference is whether you see "negotiation" as a metaphor for "war" or "fisticuffs" or as a metaphor for "cooperation" or "collaboration."
- The comment, "How does the company calculate the fair market value?", misrepresents the company as calculating and the employee as complying, and the comment, "If someone else offers a higher price, will you accept it?", misrepresents the employee side as offering a price and the company complying. Neither is a negotiation.
- I wonder if it is important to have an environment where "[[psychological safety]]" is ensured as a prerequisite, and where people can express their doubts about their treatment if they have any. Some people are afraid that they will be treated unfairly if they speak up, but I think a safe atmosphere is created by the "[[trust]]" that the company has built up over the years by advocating "[[answerability]]" and responding to it with [[sincerity]]. #Trust in the company #Social Relational Capital
- Probably the same as [[Coral Reef Parable]], we have been steadily building up discreet measures over nearly a decade, and now they are showing a little above the surface of the ocean.
- Some people look only at the part above sea level and say, "I understand the ideal, but how can we make it happen, we are not on the ground. However, this is not an "ideal" but a "reality. The reason why it looks like an "ideal" that does not have its feet on the ground is only because that person does not see what is piled up below the sea surface.

- Cybozu today" tends to catch people's attention, but I think what is useful as knowledge is "what Cybozu has done in the past 10 years to get to where it is today. There is a book by the president himself, in which he talks about his own naked failures, as well as a variety of information provided by employees, so you should be able to track a lot just from the public information.
- It's not open to the outside world, but internal discussions and decisions are kept as electronic data on groupware, and it's a much easier subject for management studies.
- While I think it's beneficial to do this, I have other tasks that have higher priority, so I don't do anything because I think it's a "phenomenon of procrastination due to the size of the task," so I split up the task and write down miscellaneous bullet points in Scrapbox [[Cybozu's Human Resources System]]
