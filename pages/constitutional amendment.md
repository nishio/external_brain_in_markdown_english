> On February 17, 2017, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) released a "Statement of Opinion Opposing the Creation of an Emergency Clause (National Emergency Powers) in the Constitution of Japan" and on May 2, 2022, the "Chairman's Statement Opposing the Creation of an Emergency Clause through Constitutional Amendment and the Term Extension of the House of Representatives Members". The statement opposed granting the Cabinet the power to enact cabinet orders with the same force and effect as laws because of the high risk of abuse of power by the government due to the extreme concentration of power, the possibility of drastic restrictions on human rights that are the foundation of democracy, and the risk of undermining constitutionalism and making recovery difficult once the clauses are exercised.

> The Constitution has not been amended once in the 70-plus years since it was enacted and enforced. I believe that the Constitution needs to be updated to meet the greatly changed domestic and international environment.
>  The three principles of the Japanese Constitution will not be changed ・Sovereignty of the people, respect for fundamental human rights, and pacifism
>  I propose to revise and add 4 items.
>  1. Clearly state "Self-Defense Forces" and reference to "measures for self-defense" in relation to security.
>  2. Strengthen emergency response, such as in the event of a major earthquake
>  3. Dissolve commingled districts in the House of Councillors, elect at least one person from each prefecture.
>  4. Enhancement of the educational environment that is not influenced by the family's economic circumstances
