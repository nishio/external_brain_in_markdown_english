### Summary of notes
.
Power does not necessarily mean strength.

### Relation to Fragment
.
This note is related to the fragments "Strengths or Values Should be Prioritized?", "Stronger People", "Undeterred Strength", and "Voice and Strength". These fragments offer different perspectives on power and strength. For example, "Which Should Take Priority, Strengths or Values?" offers an idea of how strength should be used. Strengths that Appear Strong" illustrates that there is often a gap between apparent strength and actual strength. Strength without Fear emphasizes the importance of the ability to keep moving forward in the face of challenges. Voice and Power explores the dynamics between the powerful and the powerless.

### deep thinking
Power and strength are not necessarily synonymous. While power indicates ability or influence, strength is determined by how one uses or appears to use that power. Having strength and using that strength appropriately are two different skills. Also, apparent strength does not necessarily reflect actual strength. How a person with strength is perceived by others depends on how he or she uses or appears to use that strength.
