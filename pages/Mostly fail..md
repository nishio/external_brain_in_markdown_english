#Luck
- [[Tadashi Yanai]]  「 [[one victory and nine losses]] 」

So you need to reduce the risk according to your [[risk tolerance]].
    - [[Limitation of Risk]]

Risk tolerance is a human attribute
- For example, a junior high school student worries about buying a 2,000 yen technical book and borrows an old book from the library instead of buying it in the end.
- On the other hand, working engineers think that a 2,000 yen technical book is cheap, and buy it immediately without checking its reputation.
- What is the difference? It is the difference in risk tolerance for "buying books"
- Differences in disposable income is one factor, but I think [[Differences in risk-taking experience]] is a bigger factor than that.

Risk tolerance is a person's attribute, and no one but you can adjust it to match your risk tolerance.
