title: "Is parallel work right?"
---

- Makes it difficult to concentrate on writing the program.
    - Indeed!
    - But [[Is it good to focus?]]

    - The [[parallel work]] allowed me to achieve unexpectedly high results in a finely fragmented amount of time.
    - Satisfying unmet [[demand]] generates [profit
        - A gap exists and the process of closing it creates profit # Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water
            - There is a lot of unmet demand across [Organizational Boundaries
        - This generated unexpectedly high revenues.
    - On the other hand, I'm certainly losing time to concentrate on writing programs.

- Is it right to do only easy and profitable tasks?
    - Profit is a requirement for survival, not an objective.
        - Drucker: [[Profit is a condition, not an objective, of a company]].

- Maximizing Learning, not Maximizing Profit, should be the goal.
    - This is just Nishio's personal ideology.
    - Why do you think so?

- First they do some sort of task X.
- Then do another kind of task y
    - If you don't like Task X and are escaping
    - If challenged with the idea that Task Y should be learned
    - The latter view is healthier.
    - But it is impossible to identify which one it is. Even he may be fooling himself.
- What if this task Y is unexpectedly profitable?

    - [[Anything that no longer functions must be destroyed.]]
    - If the goal is to generate revenue, it "works" while revenue is being generated, so just keep going.
    - If the goal is to learn, even if it is profitable, it should be discarded when it becomes "it takes up time, but no learning is gained".
    - In the end, it comes down to how you set your objectives.

    - [[Specialists and generalists]]
    - [[economy of continuity]]
