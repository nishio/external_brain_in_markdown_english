title: "a throw"

Japanese people do not distinguish between singular and plural.

After I wrote this with the feeling that "there is a tendency not to distinguish between the two," I thought "this is not a common expression in the Japanese language," but I made a note of it because it's interesting.

Shunyasuke" means "it looks like I won't", which is slightly different in nuance.
