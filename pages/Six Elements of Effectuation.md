title: "Six Elements of Effectuation"
---

Six elements from the analysis of the entrepreneurial process
    - Start with [[means]], not [Objective.
    - who they were: start with what you think you are
    - what they know: start with what you know.
    - whom they know: make someone you know (a partner) a customer
    - [[Expected profit]] not [[tolerable loss]]
- The first customer becomes a partner and the partner becomes a customer.
- Ignore competition and emphasize partnerships.
- Spinning out, not finding a market
- Unexpected results, not objectives found in advance.
    - Drucker's idea that [[Unexpected Success]] is [[Innovation Opportunities]] is the same as Drucker's idea that [[Unexpected Success]] is [Innovation Opportunities

- [[effectuation]]  p.42
- It is emphasized that this is the opposite of textbook [coaxialization
- After all, isn't this [[being on the wrong side of (e.g. an attack)]] a theory widely taught in MBAs?
    - When it was the high road and not systematized, gaining MBA-like knowledge led to success.
    - Widespread knowledge has increased competition as those with the same knowledge make the same decisions.
    - So it became beneficial to reverse the process.
