Pragmatism may be an effective way to reconcile the conflict between rationalism and empiricism. But how should that method be embodied? And how should the debate between materialism and theism be resolved? These questions can deeply affect our daily lives and social culture.

James' "pragmatism" represents the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, defining truth in relation to experience. He also states that the argument between materialism and theism becomes meaningless when nothing can be derived from future experience or action. He points out that the objection to materialism is negative, and that there is no guarantee against idealistic concerns. The concept of God, on the other hand, guarantees practical superiority.

Nishio's fragment "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered" raises the questions of how pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, how the debate between materialism and theism should be resolved, how free will and determinism How should the conflict between free will and determinism be resolved?

In PRAGMATISM, pragmatism is proposed as the mediator between positivism and rationalism, stating that truth is the good of belief and resolves conflicts between truths.

From these perspectives, it is important to ask how the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affects our daily lives and social culture, and how these conflicts should be resolved.

James' "Pragmatism" discusses the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, noting that modern people have empiricist tendencies but also seek religious elements. This symbolizes the conflict between rationalism and empiricism.

Pragmatism defines truth by its relationship to experience and demonstrates an antinomian tendency. This begs the question, "How should the conflict between rationalists and empiricists be resolved?" This could be one answer to the question "How should the conflict between rationalists and empiricists be resolved?

Pragmatism also adheres to facts and concreteness, observing and generalizing truth as working in particular cases. It becomes a class name that refers to all of the specific working values in experience.

James' Pragmatism, on the other hand, states that the arguments of materialism and theism become meaningless if nothing can be derived from future experience or action. Matter and God refer to the forces that create this world, and the difference between materialism and theism presents a very different outlook on experience from the perspective of the future.

The real objection to materialism is not positive but negative, that it is not a lasting guarantee for our more idealistic interests, but an achiever of our most distant hopes. On the other hand, the concept of God, no matter how clear it is, at least guarantees this practical advantage.

From these perspectives, it is important to ask how the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affects our daily lives and social culture, and how these conflicts should be resolved.

- James' "Pragmatism" discusses the dilemmas of philosophy, the significance of pragmatism, metaphysical issues, the concept of truth, humanism, and its relation to religion. He states that philosophy is the noblest and at the same time the most trivial of human pursuits. Two philosophical temperaments are put forward, the rationalist and the empiricist, and it is acknowledged that each has a low opinion of the other.
1. how should the conflict between rationalists and empiricists be resolved?
2. how does the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affect our daily lives?
3. how does the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affect our society and culture?

In this fragment, it is stated that people today have an empiricist bent, but also seek a religious component. However, the philosophies offered in reality are [[non-religious empiricism]] and [[non-empiric religious philosophy]], neither of which fully satisfies. This situation is emblematic of the conflict between [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].
