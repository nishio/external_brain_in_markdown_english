As soon as they come in, we'll take them out."
and
Stick together similar tasks for greater efficiency."
and ... and
- Doesn't [[Seven Habits]], "Don't be reactive, be proactive" cause [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]]?

What is the point of the claim to do the task as soon as it comes in?
- If you leave a task as it comes in.
    - accumulate
        - They stick together and get bigger.
        - Even if it's not physically bigger, having a lot of it is distracting and requires relatively "greater energy."
        - Things can get really big in the domestic relations area.
            - I should have washed it as soon as I ate it, but I left it to dry out and it got stuck and moldy.
        - Tasks larger than O(N) are more efficient if they are defeated frequently.
    - You know, they can disappear.
        - You come up with an idea, your boss comes up with an idea, but the next day you forget about it.
        - Someone else will do it.
            - They wash the clothes my mom took off and left behind.

Under what conditions does attaching similar tasks improve efficiency?
- Pre- and post-processing is required, which will be common
    - Going to the mailbox to put out the mail is mostly a travel cost; it is better to accumulate and put out all the mail at once than to put out each piece one by one.
    - Do not hoard for a week.
