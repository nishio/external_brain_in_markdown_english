<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This series of tweets offers deep insights into [[learning through play]] and its real-world applications. In particular, they highlight the role of [[playing]] in fostering innovation and creativity in the areas of technology and science. These tweets can be summarized by focusing on the importance of learning through play.
- ADAPTING TO PARADIGM SHIFTS: The attitude of dismissing new technologies and ideas as "toys" has been seen many times in the past. Technological advances such as the Internet, COBOL, and Z-80 often challenged existing understandings and values. Exposure to and experimentation with new technologies through play can help address these [[paradigm shifts]] and lead innovation.
- [[Understanding through Experience]]: Building model airplanes and playing with radio-controlled airplanes are important ways to gain a deeper understanding of the basic theories of aeronautical design. Through hands-on experience, students can experience the physical principles and constraints behind the theory in a way that cannot be obtained from textbooks alone.
- Creativity and Solution Seeking: The experiences gained through play provide "[[drawers]] for finding creative solutions to unknown problems that are not found in textbooks. By making many attempts through play, students learn from their mistakes and promote more flexible and innovative thinking.
- Application in Practice: Skills and knowledge acquired through play are directly applied to solving complex real-world problems. The ability to go beyond the "right" answers in textbooks, as in the design of the Honda Jet, to find and implement unique solutions is rooted in the deep understanding and experience gained through play and experimentation.
- Gap with Social Valuation: Unfortunately, abilities acquired through play are not always valued within business organizations. Cultures that emphasize textbook knowledge and methods tend to undervalue the creativity and flexibility gained through play. However, it is important to recognize and promote the value of this kind of learning through play for long-term innovation and growth.

Learning through play provides valuable insights and skills that cannot be gained from textbooks or traditional education alone. These experiences not only foster individual creativity, but also provide the foundation for technological advancement and innovation throughout society.

I remember that those who said "XXX is just a toy" or "What's the use of XXX" in the computer industry were shaken off every time a paradigm shift occurred.
>  >sshinohe: Whenever I tell people about the importance of model airplane experience in becoming a high-level airplane designer, there are always people who vehemently object. It may be a complex, but I think the secret to a meaningful life is to realize that you can't do what you were born to do.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774672563337310241) When the Internet (HTTP and web-based networking) became popular, there were a lot of people who laughed at it and said, "That's just a toy. There were so many people who laughed at it, saying "That's just a toy. Some said, "The OSI protocol is an international standard," while others said, "We can't use it for business unless it's a service that companies are responsible for managing.

I was wondering why they were so confident and definitive.

And actually building and trying out a bad plane is fraught with time and financial difficulties. ...Oh, and Dr. Rutan, please sit down.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774675526512431601) But with hand-thrown gliders and radio-controlled airplanes, you can try as many unusual shapes that deviate from the theory as you want. It's the difference between understanding that "the textbook said it was no good" and understanding that "I actually tried it and what didn't work."

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774675958399898011) What can be created by engineers who have acquired such things as experience and those who have swallowed them as rote memorization from a textbook? What we face in reality is not necessarily only problems for which we know the "right answer" from the beginning.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774677866095247625) Engineers who only know "the right answer from the textbook" have shallow "drawers" and get stuck when they run into problems that were not in the textbook. They are stuck when they run into a problem that was not in the textbooks. On the other hand, an engineer who has "played around" with a lot of stupid experiments has a drawer that says, "Why don't you try using something you've tried before? What about using something you've tried before?

I feel that the larger a company becomes, the more it tends to value "iikochan" who give answers that follow the model answers in textbooks.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774679403513192574) When I saw the actual HondaJet HA-420 and saw the spoiler shape on the upper and lower surfaces of the main wings and the rudder sheet metal finish, I said "Wow, wow, wow!" I exclaimed. The shape was realized in a way that could not be achieved only by the correct answers written in textbooks! I thought. The will to say, "But I'm going to do it this way," after understanding both the correct answer and the reason for it in the textbooks.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774680034500018258) While the unique engine mounts and thoroughly reduced drag on the wing topsides push through their intentions while fighting the monster that is the "formal certification review," the wings' undersides and rudder sheet metal easily compromise with reality. On the other hand, the underside of the wings and the rudder sheet metal easily compromise with reality. This is a crystallization of the triumph of management.

> [uchujin17](https://twitter.com/uchujin17/status/1774680460704227477) And in airplane design, textbooks do not tell you what compromises to make and where to draw the line of non-negotiables. It is something that is drawn with a will rooted in experience, and what supports that will is the confidence that "I have actually moved my hands and felt the movement of the air.
