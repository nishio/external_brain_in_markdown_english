I know Nietzsche says something like that.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Nietzsche often discussed the concept of right and wrong and ideas about morality. In particular, the concepts of "[[ressentiment]]" or "[[master morality]]" and "[Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)" involve themes similar to those you mention The concept of "[[slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche]]" is involved in a theme similar to your reference. (<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I would normally translate this as "[[Herrenmoral (master morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)]]")

According to Nietzsche, lusantiman is [[a desire for revenge]] arising from dissatisfaction and jealousy toward others, and is an emotion that the weak have toward the strong. Slave morality is built on this lusantiman, creating a moral system to condemn and self-justify the strong and the "evil".

On the other hand, master morality is from the perspective of the strong, emphasizing power and creativity, and valuing personal growth and achievement. The strong accept decline and difficulty as inevitable and find means to overcome them.

According to Nietzsche's philosophy, these differences in moral views are based on differing perceptions of the world, and the gap is so fundamental that it creates difficulties for both sides to understand and agree. These ideas continue to influence modern views of the concepts of right and wrong and ethics.
