- I used the word "model" in [[Learning Cycle]], but I thought it would be "predictive model" if we reduced the level of abstraction a little more.
- I was making [[Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Using LLM (Presentation Material)]] in 2024 and thought
- The existence of an abstract "forecasting model" will result in concrete "[[forecasting results]]" from it.
    - Whether this specific prediction is correct or not is [[Verified by experiment]].
    - When it is predicted that some action will yield a beneficial result, it is practiced, and if the prediction is correct [[Beneficial results are obtained and gained.]], if the prediction is not, opportunities for improvement of the predictive model are obtained and gained.
    - Predicted results are [[hypothesis for application]].
            - So we [[verify]] it because it is a [hypothesis
