    - Sometimes you find out after you start running that the objectives set forth in [[in advance]] are not appropriate.
    - If you have an [[Objective.]] ([[vision]]) and attract people who share it, it is difficult to change it even if you think the objective is not appropriate
    - Old title: When you gather people with a purpose, you cannot change it even if you think [Purpose is not appropriate
- People first, purpose second

    - > First choose a person, then a target.
    - > I expected that the first step in making the leap to greatness would be to develop a new direction, a new vision and strategy, and the next step would be to rally the people.

        - [[First choose the person, then the goal.]]
