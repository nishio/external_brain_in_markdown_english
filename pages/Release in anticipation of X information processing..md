### digest
.
Notes on self, others, and AI during sleep. The thoughts and actions of the self influence others and AI, and vice versa. The sleeping self can gain new perspectives and knowledge by letting others and AI influence its own thoughts and actions.
- I guess I didn't get the concept of "the waking self delegating information processing to the sleeping self."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

### Relevance
.
It has relevance to the fragment "Intelligent Collaboration Between AI and Humans." This fragment describes the experience of AI organizing and giving new form to thoughts while humans sleep. This is consistent with the "sleeping self" described in the note, which delegates thinking to others and to the AI.

### THOUGHTS
As the sleeping self surrenders its thoughts to others or AI, it can gain new perspectives and knowledge beyond its own perspective. This may contribute to deepening knowledge and generating new ideas.

### Title
.
'Interactions between self, others, and AI during sleep.'
