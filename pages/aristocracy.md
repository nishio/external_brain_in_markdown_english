title: "aristocracy"
---

The topic turned from social networking in Prosin to the aristocracy, and I was thinking again that that was an angle I hadn't really thought about.

I did some light historical research.
- The early aristocracy was one that obtained a high position in exchange for [[risk-taking]] to "fight on the front lines in time of war."
- With the modernization of the military, the nobility no longer fought on the front lines and lost ground.
- Inertia has kept vested interests in place because there is no mechanism to remove them, even though there is no longer any basis for maintaining them.
- Movements to overthrow the aristocracy, such as the French Revolution, and democracy prevails.
you mean?

If so, then the aristocracy before and after the modernization of the military should be considered separately, and the fact that the latter was bad and was overthrown by democracy has nothing to do with the goodness or badness of the former.

- Can't we have a good combination of [[democratic system]] and aristocracy?

- Whether to recognize a hereditary aristocracy
- Whether to allow inheritance of wealth

- Bravery to fight on the front lines = [[risk-taking]] disposition
