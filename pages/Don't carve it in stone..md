title: "Don't carve it in stone."
---

> ([[Glen Weyl]]) [[A]] bad way to respect innovators is to treat them like gods. A good way to respect innovators is to follow their example. If you go to the [[Jefferson Memorial]] in the United States, you will see on the wall that "[[the Constitution]] needs to be rewritten every 20 years. And when you go to people in the United States who revere Thomas Jefferson, they do not want to touch the Constitution at all. That is a paradox. When you read the words of Jesus Christ and read the words of [[Lao-tzu]] and see how they are practiced today, people should follow the example and not carve it [[in stone]].
