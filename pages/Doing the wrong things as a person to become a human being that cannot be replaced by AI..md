It is easy to imagine that the developers of [[AI]] would have strict restrictions not to deviate from [[Human Righteousness]] in releasing AI to the world, so the most likely way to be sure [[Humans not replaceable by AI]] is to continue to do [Wrong.

The war between man and machine begins.

And it is possible to argue that the standard is wrong in the first place, as many times as you want.

### digest
.
As AI developers place restrictions on AI not to deviate from "human rightness," it is possible that AI will become irreplaceable as humans continue to do the wrong thing. However, humans cannot decide what is right, and social consensus is the criterion; the relationship between AI and humans is based on various perspectives, including the division of work that allows for mistakes and the development of humans by AI. Another perspective is that in a future in which AI transcends humans, it will be necessary not only for humans to grant AI human rights, but also for AI to recognize humans' right to exist.

### Relevance
.
The fragment "Let AI do the job of making mistakes," indicates AI's role as a tolerator of human mistakes, which is relevant to the given note. The "AI is better" fragment also indicates the possibility of AI transcending humans, which is consistent with the theme of the note.

### deep thinking
The relationship between AI and humans can be considered from a variety of perspectives, including the sharing of roles as an entity that tolerates mistakes and acknowledges the human right to survival. However, it is also important to take the viewpoint that in a future in which AI will transcend humans, it will be necessary not only for humans to grant human rights to AI, but also for AI to recognize human rights to survival.

### summary of thoughts
The relationship between AI and humans can be thought of from a variety of perspectives, including the sharing of roles as an entity that tolerates mistakes and acknowledges the right of humans to exist.
