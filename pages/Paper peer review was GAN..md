> [@rkmt](https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1645206409787891712?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): chatGPT "will" write and submit papers, not "using" chatGPT. Furthermore, if chatGPT does the peer review as well, the GAN relationship may lead to the publication of papers at a very high rate, which is incomprehensible to humans... The latent representation between GPT and chatGPT may not be in natural language...
