title: "Discord is all about flow."
---

- [[Discord]] is allocated to [flow
- Initially there was no [[Permalink.]] for statements
    - Contrast with Slack and others that put permalinks on each post.
- Because it comes from real-time game chat?
- Maybe the culture is to write in [[Wiki]] what should be saved in the first place?
    - The thought that chat logs that may be mentioned in the future should be reprinted
    - Clear switching between flow and stock
