Remember what you're throwing away.

Analysis is basically about discarding what is uninteresting from a vast amount of information, leaving only what is interesting. If we pay attention to what is discarded by the analysis, rather than applying existing analysis methods uncritically, new ideas may emerge.
Take the simple analysis method of "taking an average" as an example. Data consisting of N samples is a point in N-dimensional space, and reducing it to a single value, the average, is an N-1 dimensional reduction. Rotating the data and reducing it to a root Nth of a point, we are only interested in the components along a particular axis. So what's the component that's being discarded in the direction perpendicular to that axis?

It is a higher moment in variance, in skewness, in kurtosis. Is this discarded information a pile of garbage or a treasure trove?

### Summary of notes
.
Analysis is the process of discarding what is unnecessary from information and retaining what is useful. However, new ideas can be generated by paying attention to what is discarded rather than applying analysis methods uncritically. For example, in the analysis method of "taking the average," information in N-1 dimensions is discarded by reducing data in N-dimensional space to a single value. This discarded information is higher-order moments such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, and whether they are garbage or treasure depends on one's point of view.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragment "Remembering What is Discarded" share the perspective of focusing on information that is discarded in the process of analysis. They share the idea that new ideas may be generated by paying attention to what is discarded, rather than uncritically applying analytical methods.

### deep thinking
Focusing on information that is discarded in the process of analysis has the potential to generate new perspectives and ideas. However, whether the information is garbage or treasure depends on one's point of view. This indicates that the value of information depends on how that information is interpreted and how it is used.

Paying attention to information that is discarded in the process of analysis has the potential to generate new perspectives and ideas. Whether that information is garbage or treasure depends on the viewpoint.
