CodeMaoIDE
- [https://ide.code.game/](https://ide.code.game/)
- Tools that make it easy to do amazing things
- Tutorials are being made.
- Does it work in a browser and output an exe?
    - Code created in blocks is converted to python and js.
    - I wonder if they make an exe from Python, or if they bundle the JS and it's electron-like.

    - > CodeMao has a type, errors exist.
    - > I found Scratch to be superior in the ability to draw costumes. Once saved, it is a bitmap image and cannot be changed from pass to pass.
    - > What I like about CodeMao
        - > Able to resize the screen.
        - > Easy to create scene transitions
        - > Expansion blocks are available for cloud lists, GameAI, physics engines, etc.
        - > Some minor features such as folding code, easy to read comments, else if can be made in one block, etc.
- I also made a game when I got home [https://ide.code.game/we/8984](https://ide.code.game/we/8984)

    - Scene management is attached to the original.
        - Once I made the game, I wanted to add a title screen later.
            - I couldn't figure out how to add a scene to the foreground after the fact.
            - I couldn't even figure out how to set the initial display scene.
            - So I created a title screen after the game scene and tried to copy and paste the contents of the game screen into the scene behind it.
            - Error message that the function name is duplicated even though the original function has been deleted, and reloading the IDE does not cure the problem.
            - Even if you change the function name, the function call block cannot freely edit the name of the function to be called, so you have to recreate the whole function.
                - tiresome
