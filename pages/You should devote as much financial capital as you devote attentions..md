You should devote as much financial capital as you devote attentions.
- [[What if a new continent is discovered?]]
- How I feel now
    - I think you should devote as much financial capital as you devote attentions.
    - (If you act on the thought, you'll be quite surprised at the amount of money that people around you will be Eth, though.)
    - It's not a day to day situation, so take your time and think about it.
    - I'd like to know how the issuance volume is controlled.
        - [[staking]], an unfamiliar concept.
        - Ah, the [[Proof-of-Stake]] stake.

        - It seems odd to me that you write that deflation is a price drop.
            - When a currency is in deflation, a drop in the price of a commodity happens because the currency is gaining value.
