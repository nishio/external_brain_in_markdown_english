Respect for minority opinion" is a [[low-resolution concept]], and it's a lot more detailed than that.

- A: [[decision-maker]]'s "I don't want to miss [[an important opinion]]"
- B: "[[I don't want my opinion]] to be ignored" by those without decision-making authority

have


The former "important opinion" is
- A1: Silent Majority
- A2: A few but important opinions for reasons other than numbers
    - Fordback from experts, or a minority who would suffer negative impacts from a change in the system.

I tend to summarize this "we shouldn't overlook A2, right?" as "respect for minority opinion".
- But being few is not a sufficient condition for being important.
- So, it may be [[misleading summary]], [[Inappropriate abstraction]].

Whether they realize it or not, people without decision-making authority B use "respect for minority opinions" as a [[gold-brocade flag]] way to draw attention to their opinions.
- This probably lowers [[quality of decision-making]], so I think [[mechanism design]] is needed to prevent such things from happening.
