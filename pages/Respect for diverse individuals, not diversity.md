[The slogan "respect for diversity" should be abandoned｜Lawyer Hori｜note](https://note.com/horishinb/n/n99e0a9e9d7a3)
- > If we get too caught up in the slogan "respect for diversity," we run the risk of forgetting the essential aspects of human rights and freedoms and becoming complacent, as if respecting mere "conditions" or "characteristics" is all that is necessary.
- [[Article 13 of the Constitution of Japan]] [[All the people shall be respected as individuals]]. The rights of the people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, so far as they are not inconsistent with the public welfare, require the utmost respect in legislation and other national affairs.
    - > This is not only in the Constitution of Japan, but also in Article 1 of the German Basic Law.
- > In short, it was not about "[[respect for]] diversity" but about "[[respect for]] the individual. Since each human being is different, it goes without saying that individuals are, by nature, "diverse. In other words, "respect for the individual" is equal to "[[respect for diverse individuals]].
    - [[Individuals are diverse by nature.]]

- [[100 men, 100 ways]]
- [[People have personalities.]]
[[Diverse personalities]].
- [[diversity]]
[[Plurality]]
