- Some [[reuse]] of past lecture materials and give a new lecture.
    - Right now, electronic data is printed, cut, and laid out on a desk, which is inefficient.
- Compose books, longer lectures, etc.
    - You'll want to use past lecture materials even when you don't reuse them.
            - Writing [[Fragmentary notes]] and then [[structuring]] them.
- I want to do something about the Scrapbox page that has lost its visibility.
    - Structuring what is written down
- A book that I would like to structure within myself.
        - Structure [extract
