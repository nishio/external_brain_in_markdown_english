- We could have made this discussion fruitful rather than violent and divisive by asking the question, "How do we...?" could have made this discussion fruitful instead of violent and divisive!
> That rephrasing results in the question, “What kind of society do we want to create for people who haven’t been born yet?” If you use the planning horizon of 10 or 20 years down the road for a conversation, people who might otherwise disagree can work very collaboratively.
- As a result, the question arises, "What kind of society do we want to create for those who have not yet been born?" If we talk with a planned perspective of 10 or 20 years into the future, even people who normally would not agree with each other can work very cooperatively.
