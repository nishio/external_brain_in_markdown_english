Highly secure to discuss git rebase (related to LFS) in advance if you are not confident > o1
It was subtly wrong, though (...)

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871459740011876760) There are two errors in the rebase and o1 Pro explanations for organizing commits that were a hassle due to LFS. Point them out (50 points each) [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/676a63e7-af14-8011-bf44-ffc32258be49)
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871460113451782231) I ran this and corrected it and ran it, "Oh, it's wrong," but I'm not sure I could point it out if I was shown just the chat logs...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1871689162363195658) Solution:.
>  (1) Changes not staged for commit so I have to git stash first to rebase
>  (2) git rebase -i HEAD~3 is really HEAD~4 (I want to squash in the add aipubcom dataset commit, but with HEAD~3 it won't be in rebase-todo)

A problem that took me half a day to wrap my head around during the June gubernatorial election,
(Aside from my skill growth, which I know is the problem.)
I told o1 Pro to write a README, and he quickly wrote an explanation that didn't fall into any pitfalls.
I feel like this is a really convenient time.

By having AI write the README that I am too lazy to write.
I think it will facilitate the social implementation of my deliverables.
If you review the Japanese version and ask them to make an English version, they will make it in English.

I'm going to have my year's worth of Scrapbox writing compiled over the holiday season.
