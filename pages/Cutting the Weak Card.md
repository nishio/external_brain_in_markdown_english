title: "Cutting the Weak Card"

> [63cities](https://x.com/63cities/status/1822028797405024557) I was excited to see what was going to happen when a wonderful [[lesba]] between cynical subculture otaku on the Internet arose. I was excited to see what would happen, but it turned out to be an epic [[weak card]] cutting contest, and I learned that "Otaku are strangely aggressive because they think they are (or should be) allowed to be so by being weak".

> [63cities](https://x.com/63cities/status/1822029483735748764) It is the modern Internet that makes you feel good by sneakily attacking others while appealing to the weak, and when your aggression is pointed out, you take offense by expressing your feelings. It's a winning strategy.
