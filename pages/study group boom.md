> [@athlonz](https://twitter.com/athlonz/status/1588848311234351105?s=46&t=FZjorh3_yoJmVIYHdSAt7Q): The study group boom started in 2006, but as the main players got older, started families, or got promoted, they had less time to continue the study groups and less to gain from them (and they completed their networking). The study group boom started in 2006, but as the main players got older, had families, and moved up in the world, they had less time to continue the study group and less to gain from it (and also completed their network of contacts).

> [@wakatono](https://twitter.com/wakatono/status/1588927799284621312?s=20&t=BEVn8tYDODF0dwJWTF97Tg): There were not enough knowledge acquisition channels such as seminars, and as a result As a result, activities to acquire knowledge (teaching each other) among volunteers became popular. One such activity is a study group, which is also one of the community activities.
> Now it appears that the communities that once existed are converging into a few.
- > [@wakatono](https://twitter.com/wakatono/status/1588928429315227648?s=20&t=BEVn8tYDODF0dwJWTF97Tg): there are some operations that have been going on, but still, few (if any) have been going on for 20 years. There are very few (at the grassroots study group level) that have been going on for 20 years.
- > But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's also a set of stories that the channels for acquiring knowledge have been enhanced.
- > The problem is that the activity of teaching each other about emerging technical fields, etc. is locally optimized.
- > [@wakatono](https://twitter.com/wakatono/status/1588929098050854912?s=20&t=BEVn8tYDODF0dwJWTF97Tg): Also, where do we look for the motivation of those holding the event? It is also important to talk about this.
- > Some people think it is not worth it to hold/participate in a study group when they consider the return on their time and power.
- >  Also, those who value the concept of [[typer]] probably don't see the point in attending (the playback speed of the talks that come out of the workshops are always at 1x speed).

> I have the impression that there are fewer workshops that are held quickly and vigorously on a single theme.

> [@matyubara](https://twitter.com/matyubara/status/1588958683643641861?s=20&t=uC8GQh4m9xaMke7PUI6Eyg): there's a sense that the community has moved to Discord or Slack.
> And this year, Slack's restrictions on viewing logs have almost entirely moved to Discord.

> [@igz0](https://twitter.com/igz0/status/1588851073691058176?s=20&t=uC8GQh4m9xaMke7PUI6Eyg): like the information sensitive crowd has moved on to Discord and VR.
> I don't think the need for study groups will ever go away as long as the industry is metabolizing!

> [@youten_redo](https://twitter.com/youten_redo/status/1588856257813024769?s=20&t=uC8GQh4m9xaMke7PUI6Eyg): We've had some difficulties with Corona, but we're usually still online. Unlike the old days of Ustream, now even the detailed UI of full HD IDEs can be put on YouTube, so we're doing okay.

> [@xhiroga](https://twitter.com/xhiroga/status/1588853131148152832?s=20&t=uC8GQh4m9xaMke7PUI6Eyg): I thought it might be the difference between a generation that can talk about the Internet as a single community and a generation that takes the Internet I think there is a difference between a generation that can talk about the internet as a community and a generation that takes the internet for granted and has several communities within it.

> [@nekomatu](https://twitter.com/nekomatu/status/1588900247518187520?s=20&t=uC8GQh4m9xaMke7PUI6Eyg): it's a problem.
> Online events are held all over the country, and thanks to Youtube, high-quality archives can also be left behind.
> The presenter's side is more like a seminar, which makes it difficult to have a friendly atmosphere with humor, Q&A, and commentary.
