title: "Different story."
---

People sometimes respond with "that's a different story than this one."

The definition of "different" is unclear when it says "X and Y are different stories.
- naively, unless Y is a word-for-word copy of X, in which case they are "different."
    - In this case, "different" is self-explanatory, so there is no information content in pointing out that it is not.
    - Either the speaker is making a zero information statement, or the speaker has some particular definition of "different".
    - → To have a constructive discussion, it is necessary to confirm what the speaker means by "different."
