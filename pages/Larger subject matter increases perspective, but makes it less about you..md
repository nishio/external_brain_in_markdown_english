title: "Larger subject matter increases perspective, but makes it less about you."

> [YukiAnzai](https://x.com/YukiAnzai/status/1805801752081711466) One of the basic ideas of [[facilitation]] is to adjust the "[[subject]]" of the question. The larger the subject, the more the perspective of the place is enhanced, but it becomes less about oneself. Conversely, the more the subject is "you" or "I," the more the dialogue becomes more personal, but the center of gravity of the field is lowered, making it more difficult to summarize.

>  Furthermore, adding the "[[time axis]]" control here is to create a three-dimensional trajectory for the discussion process by combining multiple questions.
