    - [[Live = Grow]] type mental model
    - The establishment of this mental model at a young age causes [[cognitive dissonance]], recognizing that at some point you will decline
    - By shifting the boundary of "self" at this time, it is possible to interpret that "self" in the narrow sense has declined, but "self" in the broad sense has not declined.
    - This time of year, we tend to think of this "extended self" as "AI!" I tend to think
        - Historically, in the long period before the advent of computers, wasn't it "organization"?
        - But the leader of a 100-person organization was a scarce resource that could only be one in 100.
        - AI could give more people a sense of continual growth.
    - Extension of moratorium
        - [[Retirement]]
        - [[wet leaves]]
            - A baby who is suddenly cut off from the organization he mistakenly thought was his body "because I'm retired" and doesn't know what to do.
    - In the Showa era, the opportunity for that form of "[[extended self]]" was occupied by men.
        - Instead the woman had the child as an extension herself?
            - I think that's a bit of an exaggeration.
            - Of course there were those types of people, but they don't seem to be the majority.
