- Exit the group if dragged outside the group
- No, it's not. We have to think about it right.
- Not "Exit when a sticky in a group is dragged outside."
- And if a sticky in a group is dropped on top of another group, I want it moved.
- And if I drop something on top of a group that is not in the group at this time, I want it to be in the group,
- In other words, we need to determine if the thing is in position to drop.
- I want you to be in the innermost group when groups are nested.
- If you pull one out of a group with only two elements, should the rest be ungrouped?
    - It is not good if an empty group is created by taking an element from a group with only one element.

grouping
- KJ method grouping is pseudo-3D [/nishio/KJ-method is pseudo-3D](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/KJ-method is pseudo-3D).
- Groups must be easy to open and close
    - Don't take the trouble to check what's inside.
- Work to attach a nameplate
    - essential
    - But trying to make a new sticky note in VR now, both keystrokes and handwritten input are very difficult...
    - If I had to do it, I'd type it in by hand...
