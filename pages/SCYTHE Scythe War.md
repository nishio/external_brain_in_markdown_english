The game ends quite abruptly, as the game ends the moment the sixth star appears.
One more turn would have given me the last mech, and I would have had my troops canned in about 3 turns, I wasn't prepared for that mindset, so I didn't have much scoring action. The result was 2nd place, but it was like 70 points for 1st place, 38 points for 2nd place, and 32 points for 3rd place.
I'm sure there will be a suitable way to fight, as each civilization has its own starting point and resource layout in the surrounding area.
