title: "Tutorial for making 🤔 sentences"
---

from  [[🤔Make 3 explanations of how to use Regroup in specific applications.]]
Maybe a tutorial on making sentences would be a good idea.
- Examples of using Keicho for making sentences
        - [[Consider explaining the new features.]]
        - What you write in the commentary is first discussed in the chat and then rearranged and composed in Regroup.
        - [[I would like to come up with an explanation of the ability to create a map of Regroup from chat logs.]]
        - Whenever we discuss how to explain a new feature, the perspective always changes dramatically.
        - That's probably because when you've finished implementing a new feature and you're thinking, "Well, how do I explain this?" you're in the creator's point of view.
        - This time the change of perspective was illustrated. Typical, like the viewpoint before the change is user-absent.
- Ideally, Keicho and Regroup would complete the process, but users are unfamiliar with either tool.
    - A good experience is not possible if the questions are not answered well and the resulting stickies made are not good enough.
    - Seems like a good way to answer the empathy writing question.
        - I tried to imagine speaking in "Listen First" mode while looking at the list of questions in [[Six Minute Writing]], but I thought Keicho should just ask this question because it's tedious to go back and forth between the list and Keicho
    - You can ask in-depth questions about what you've written.
        - When you say "next," proceed to the next question or add a "next question" button.
    - One step closer to the realization of [[🤔Task Management Chatbot]], which is still not very concrete.
- Should I return a question in response to a statement that answers an empathy writing question?
    - Cons
        - Behavior becomes unpredictable.
    - Pros
        - If your goal is to experience Keicho, you should experience the questions that come with what you write.
        - It gives a sense of "they're listening" unlike existing template-filling mechanisms.
        - Fill in a lot of questions and then ask about them and you'll get a lot of quotes.
    - It would be nice if the "next question" button could be used to move on when it is difficult to answer a question, etc.
    - This means 🤔 add command by state [Create ✅ answer choices on the server side
        - I had been thinking "wouldn't it be nice to be able to answer with a button depending on the last minute question", but it seems more versatile and better to control by state
        - This is [[change answer choices depending on the 🤔environment]].
    - [[Create ✅empathy writing mode]]

- Write usage instructions in [Writing support mode
    - Regroup needs to be explained.
    - Include modifications to make it easier to use on the part of Regroup.
