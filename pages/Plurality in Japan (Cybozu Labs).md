title: "Plurality in Japan (Cybozu Labs)"
---

- [[Cybozu Labs Study Session]]  2024-08-02
- Participated in the session [[Designing for Plurality]] at [[Funding the Commons Tokyo 2024]] with Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil (2024-07-25).
- Plurality in Japan" (7 minutes), which I prepared to speak there, was presented in Japanese in a separate session the day before for additional content and questions ([[Plurality in Japan(Japanese)]] , 40 minutes).
- I'll talk about this one for 60 minutes.
    - I'm going to ask a lot of questions.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Did the concept of broad listening come out of the Plurality community?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The concept of broad listening was named by a friend of Glenn's named [[Andrew Trask]] ([[Naming Broad Listening]]).
        - Ultimately, Yasuno learned about the concept of broad listening by looking at machine translations of Plurality books that had been placed in the Plurality Japanese translation community.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm curious how many Offensive ones there were: ......
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't have the exact percentage, but I'm guessing there were quite a few, and the toxicity score comes out something like 0%~100% on some axis, so it cuts off at the threshold of 50% or so.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Japan is not a top-down country!
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Like the pattern of going back and forth for approval.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ringi System" The Decision Making Process in Japanese Management Systems: An Overview].
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Responsibility-averse?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I guess you could say the positive aspect is that it takes time to build consensus.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That is what "CONSENSUAL" means.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I do think that the strength of the hierarchy and the denial of higher and lower ranks are somehow contradictory.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Convincing is the best priority! I think it's because there are a lot of people who are like that. Maybe there aren't many people who don't have a choice because they are told to.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The existence of the opposite style, "I can't just accept what the higher-ups tell me," is a characteristic of cultures that are not superordinate in the first place, and there are cultures that say, "The higher-ups told me, so of course I'll obey, and of course they'll take full responsibility for their decision-making.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/3614da6420442bf19fccfa2a3096257a/thumb/1000)
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Does that mean it's acceptable if the higher ups take responsibility?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>In Japan, the frontlines must also question the decisions of their superiors. That may be true.
- relevance
    - Personally, I think that "higher-ups" in Japan are not "individual bosses" but "air," "company," "world," and "common sense," the personification of a faceless group of individuals.
        - Therefore, the behavior of "individual bosses" to decide the "will of the group" (= the will of superiors) on their own is both repugnant and obedient to the decisions of the "superiors" (= the group).
            - [[Broad Listening is Important in Japan, Where Air Rules]]

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I have an image that the structure of decision making is not likely to change easily, but the structure of information transfer will change a lot.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If we can use Polis to remain anonymous and have confrontations without direct attacks [[psychological safety]] is going to be higher and better discussions.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I wonder if Japan became this style because it was a polytheistic religion rather than a monotheistic one. In other words, there were many people higher than you, so you had to decide for yourself which one was right?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>There are countries with polytheistic religions, not only Japan, so it would be strange to attribute it to them.

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Smooth, I don't really get the image of smooth. ......
    - You mean diverse perspectives? Or the opposite of an echo chamber?
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I suggest you read the original, as it is a super-summary of "[[Smooth Society and Its Enemies]]" on one page.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>I am sure that Nishio-san did not start out using the KJ method in the context of plurality, but I find it interesting that he has found a connection with it.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Of course, when we started doing the KJ method, we didn't yet have the word "plurality" in the current sense!

What is Plurality?
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/c460c9d699c6e12d138071ddbc1d136d/thumb/1000)
- A concept proposed by [[Audrey Tang]] and [[Glen Weyl]].
    - [[Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy]]
    - Techniques for Overcoming Differences and Collaboration
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>How difficult it is to "overcome differences." ......
    - A movement to update society for the better by using this technology.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/4ac3b9a1f9c315fedd31f971c39f7df2/thumb/1000)
    - The society that is being newly created is still taking shape and people have never seen it before.
    - So I can't fully explain it in existing terms.
    - We must create new words and connect them to the context to create new meanings for the words themselves
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Putting a new meaning on an existing word?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, it's in the dictionary, but I don't know what it means when I try to interpret it in the dictionary sense.
                - [[Plurality is a new term]]
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>singular plural (singular plural)
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> There is a connection between "singularity â‡” plurality".
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>By the way, why do they call it "singular" when AI will evolve so much?
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the first place, "singularity" only means "singularity", and $y = 1/x$ is a singularity at $x=0$.

Plurality Japanese edition is now available from Cybozu Shiki Books
- [Japanese translation of PLURALITY by Audrey Tan and Glenn Weil | Cybozu Shiki Books](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/books/plurality/)
- Trilogy interview with Audrey+Glen+Halsk will also be published in a Cybozu-style web article
- Why is Cybozu cooperating with Plurality?
    - Because Cybozu's mission is "[Creating a society full of teamwork
    - [[Technology to overcome "differences" and work together]] is Technology to create a society overflowing with teamwork.
    - The feeling of having found friends who share the same ideals ([[Sympathy for ideals]])

        - June 27, 2018
        - A case study of how different needs (= [[diversity]]) are taken care of with the help of [[Digital Tools]].
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Cybozu didn't even have a broad listening tool, but they've been working hard.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In 1997, when the majority of communication within organizations was still oral conversations and whiteboards, "Cybozu Office" was released and communication became "something that never goes away". As a result, roles such as information curator emerged.
        - [A story about an employee who reads all the daily reports of about 500 people and is truly amazed at how well he keeps track of internal information | Cybozu Style](https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005360.html)
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Like Cybozu Digest.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We have experienced things such as notification explosion by everyone sending out messages, etc., as our own personal experiences within our own company.
        - Things like political divisions on social networking sites didn't happen because we are a corporate organization, but you are very concerned about the possibility of divisions in the form of [[siloing]] and dealing with it, both systemically and operationally.



Dig deeper in the remaining time
- The whole thing cannot be explained in 25 minutes.
- The overarching explanation is abstract.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/48c48d4c351f9b6e246559914e2a39e6/thumb/1000)
    - I'm sure you can find that by searching, etc., so here are some interesting topics to connect to the context of Funding the Commons


[[Funding the Commons]] and Plurality
- Start with [[interchange format]] in [[Gyojin Karatani]], which Audrey referred to, and run through [[digital democracy]].
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/e7c55e5d2142df92119c3122a529c1fe/thumb/1000)
    - If food was not storable, it was more reasonable for everyone to share more than they could eat alone than to let the uneaten amount rot. (Exchange Form A)
    - The ability to preserve food has eliminated the rationale for sharing.
    - The hungry want food, so they have to offer something in exchange.
    - At this time, all that "those who have no assets" could offer was their life time.
    - Thus occurred the "subordination to others" of selling off time. (Exchange Form B)
    - This evolved into an army not engaged in productive activities.
        - The occurrence of standing armies is quite old, already documented in Mesopotamia.
    - A "state" was created to protect the "people" within from external forces through military power.
    - By eliminating others through military force, "land" that belonged to no one became privately owned.
- The same long ago created "tokens that can be saved."
    - Later it will be called money.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/9a45a0d7f1279e33aa4dd378fa330e1b/thumb/1000)[Shekel - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel)
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b977fd69e17176fe2b39ae395d0f4537/thumb/1000)
    - Replacement timing no longer needs to be synchronized, making replacement easier (Replacement Form C)
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>Efficiency through division of labor
            - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, there is that too. [[Adam Smith]].
    - More compact and stable than "storable food," easier to accumulate value
    - A synergistic effect occurred: the military strength of the value accumulation increased the reliability of this token, and vice versa, and this token increased the stability of the value accumulation
    - However, as the market for token exchange grows, geographically demarcated nations will become a hindrance.
        - The "state" as a mechanism to protect "friends" within by eliminating external enemies with military force seeks to strengthen borders, while trade seeks to weaken them.
        - The more connected the market, the more profitable it was.
    - Merchants interfere in the running of the state.
        - Venice in medieval Europe, etc.
    - The forces demanding open trade from the states became stronger and stronger, and eventually a global market was established.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Perry: "Please open the country!"
        - If you go to a convenience store there for a minute and look at the ingredients, they're harvested all over the world.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/1e0dfb89715fe6262f3a235e196ead39/thumb/1000)
    - This was a rough explanation of exchange styles A, B, and C in Yukito Karatani's theory of exchange styles.
    - By the way, if you look at world history on this scale, now is the period of "the first 100 years of the birth of the electronic calculator".
    - A new kind of "thing (goods)" has been created: digital goods.
        - Can be replicated at negligible cost.
        - A fortune spent but not reduced."
    - Just as in the days when sharing food increased the happiness of a society, copying digital goods increases the total amount of happiness in a society.
    - Digital goods, however, are inedible.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/11c2f5e7dcce3880bfb86eefd4c841c9/thumb/1000)![image](https://gyazo.com/1e0dfb89715fe6262f3a235e196ead39/thumb/1000)
        - In the course of civilization's progress to this point, most people have come to obtain their food in exchange for money.
        - If we made digital goods and gave them away for free, they would starve to death.
            - There was also an incident where an unrewarded OSS author became angry and engaged in vandalism ([[colors.js incident]]).
        - Society's overall well-being is improved if the digital goods created are copied by as many people as possible for free.
        - Why don't society fund the people who create digital goods to the extent that they don't die, and make the digital goods created into commons that are shared by everyone?
            - (For those wondering about the difference between Common Goods and Public Goods: Funding the Commons says ["We build a bridge between builders and researchers focused on transforming the funding mechanisms for public goods.)
- So what does Plurality think about this area?
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6372900530b7163c3ae1bcacc73be72f/thumb/1000)
    - An important concept is the worldview of "neither the individual nor the whole, but a number of intersecting groups.
    - From this point of view, it seems like a false choice between "private ownership" and "worldwide sharing" in terms of digital goods.
    - Glen et al. said that there is a space between Public and Private ([[Beyond Public and Private]]).
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/ab7d13bb2cc9e46965e9277f47428271/thumb/1000)
    - Something similar is said in Japan by [[Kazuto Ataka]] ([web3, Environmental Impact and Thin Commons - Between Neuroscience and Marketing [https://kaz-ataka.hatenablog.](https://kaz-ataka.hatenablog.) com/entry/2023/12/24/123010])(2023)
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/29b1c6bd44a604f6b78c354153d5d075/thumb/1000)
    - There is a growing sense that this problem is something that needs to be resolved in the future.
        - And the situation that web3 technology may be the solution to create new ownership and provision options for digital goods.
        - That's why there's a good amount of web3-related stuff in the other sessions.


[[intersecting group]] and [[Ideology in the 21st Century]].
- Talk a little more about this diagram
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/6372900530b7163c3ae1bcacc73be72f/thumb/1000)
- In this connection, [[Ideology in the 21st Century]] organizes and strongly promotes one of the three ideologies, "digital democracy," in the Plurality book
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/2517ff5e7972e528df4117e19cd6e3aa/thumb/1000)
        - from Glen's slide : [/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Keynote Japanese subtitle #65aaa7faff09e0000559732](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/Glen in Japan Keynote Japanese subtitle #65aaa7faff09e0000559732)
        - [[Integrated Technocracy]] (synthetic technocracy) is the idea that AI advances will create a being that surpasses humans, so why don't we all just leave it to it?
        - It is this ideology that is implied by the word Singularity when it is explained that "Plurality is a synonym for Singularity.
        - This corresponds to the WHOLE in the indivisual / intersecting group / whole diagram
            - ![image](https://gyazo.com/6372900530b7163c3ae1bcacc73be72f/thumb/1000)
        - I don't understand it well when I think of Plurality as a synonym for this and think of it as aiming at INDIVIDUALITY.
        - Especially web3 people would mistake it for an oppositional composition of centralized and decentralized power.
        - [[corporate libertarianism]] (corporate libertarianism) is the antipode in the conflict.
        - Using cryptography and other technologies to strengthen individual freedoms and undermine the power of government to restrict them.
        - The idea is to let the market mechanism take care of itself, so to speak.
        - This corresponds to the indivisual in the indivisual / intersecting group / whole diagram
        - A vision of avoiding and deconstructing social organization through technology and replacing trust with algorithms" by Glen
        - [[digital democracy]] also opposes [corporate libertarianism
        - For example, at yesterday's Meetup, the question was "Do you think we can have a trustless government in the future?" Audrey answered ["I don't like the word trustless. I like the word trust building.
        - They seem to think that the direction of pursuing trastress is to disassemble and destroy the existing social structure built by trust, which is undesirable.
    - You can look at these three ideologies and try to figure out which element is stronger in you.
        - [Plural Viewpoints](https://magi-nishio.vercel.app/), a service that allows questions to be posed to three different ideologies
            - Often divided, and even when not divided, there are differences in specific policies.
            - For example, "The declining birthrate and aging population are making it difficult to maintain the welfare of the elderly, what should be done?"
            - ST: Implement nursing care robots and AI to compensate for labor shortages and improve the quality of care.
            - CL: Reduce regulations and increase competition among businesses so that innovative services and products for the elderly can emerge.
            - DD: Strengthen community networks and create systems to support seniors through volunteerism and community activities.
            - Each has a point.
        - Nishio personally believes that "in the long run, it is an integrated technocracy, but before that, we need digital democracy first.
            - When AI becomes smarter than humans, AI governance will be better than human governance.
            - However, when we speak of "governing people to happiness," it is not good if some people define "happiness" in a way that imposes a form of happiness on other people, so we need a way to collect the various forms of happiness of everyone.
            - Since that is digital democracy, we can conclude that "digital democracy is necessary before integrated technocracy.
            - Regardless of whether we accept a dictatorship by a smart AI later, it is better to push for digital democracy at this point.
            - You can also decide in a digital democracy whether to accept it or not.
