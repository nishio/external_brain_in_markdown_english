I just added a Google Drive URL with over 100 PDFs from the plus icon and asked a question, and it took me about 430 seconds to go through them all.

- I was like, "Wow, I'm going to read 100+ book PDFs and the AI is going to talk to me..." but it takes 7 minutes to respond, so I did something else while I waited and forgot all about it.
- "Do you have anything of this type?" I got the impression that this question didn't go over very well.
    - Maybe because "this kind of system" is vague. I guess we can determine if it's "something that deals with hardware" or something like that, but it takes advanced thinking to find the connection to intellectual productivity improvement or digital democracy, and since the attentional mechanism is only an inner product after all, it's not possible to make a connection heading that can be found without making an abstraction.
    - If it's something that could be found in a vector search, you'll find it.
    - To do this, I wonder if it is still necessary to think [[Reasoning model]] by inputting one's thought output many times.
