title: "No working on holidays"
---

I saw the expression "It is an ultra [[white company]] that prohibits working on holidays."
It is restricting [[the freedom to work on holidays]]. It's a company that is taking away [[the freedom to choose how you work]] from its employees.

For example, if there is an interesting technical event related to work on a holiday and you want to attend, some companies say, "We will treat it as a holiday work and pay you because it is related to work.
It's hard to say "treat my participation in an event as working on my day off" in a company that has a "no working on holidays" rule.
Therefore, employees are under unspoken pressure to take the form of participating in events on their own time off.

relevance
    - [[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status]]
- Black or white" is a false dichotomy; in reality, it is a gradation of "freedom in the way you work.
    - Forced to work on holidays (very black)
    - Forced not to work on weekends
    - You may or may not work weekends and weekdays (very white).
            - [[Unlimited paid vacation system]]
    - [[Holiday Messages]]
