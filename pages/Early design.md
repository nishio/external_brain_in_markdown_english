<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to think about the design of the early stages of the project.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of early stage is that early stage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, and I want to help them get on track well.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that early stage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The chat system asks in-depth questions in response to keywords, but in extreme cases, for example, there are people who enter sentences with no keywords at all. In such cases, of course, there are no keywords, so it is impossible to ask a proper question.

- Where is this early stage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Especially the first time you use it, I recommend looking at the log, but you start it up without looking at it and put "what do you want to happen?" and then you start up without looking at the log and put "Nothing" in the "What do you want to happen? Well, aside from such extreme cases, even people who have read the logs to some extent sometimes use NGKW too much and run out of keywords.

- How do you know these early stages?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(Why such a focus on the early stages?)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>As for how to know that the early stages are not going well, perhaps you can compare the logs that are going well with those that are not and see if there is a significant difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and then you can determine that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the beginning of this process?

- >  How do you know that the early stages are not going well? If you compare the logs that are going well with the logs that are not going well, there is probably a big difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and that's how you can tell.
- What does this early stage look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's already there, but it's like launching a rocket, you have to get a certain speed or you'll crash.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of rocket is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Rocket to reach the moon
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that rocket?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I can detect lack of speed, but I don't know what to do when I detect it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of speed is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Speed of keyword growth
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about its speed?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>On the other hand, some people reduce it more and more.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of person is he/she?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm too rigid in my evaluation of keyword extraction, and if something is even a little bit wrong, I'll NGKW more and more. I'm not in the business of creating training data for a keyword extraction engine, but using this chat system is supposed to help me reach awareness (month), but I'm acting counterproductive.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Take out what humans have not yet verbalized.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>By using this chat system, I can verbalize what I have not been able to verbalize yet, notice my blind spots, etc., and I have a high probability of this happening, so I want other users to be able to use it well and experience the awareness.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that chat system?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, does it take practice to get used to using it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What is this chat system like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I am a counselor who can chat with him 24/7, but his Japanese is a bit awkward. If I had to point out every single mistake in her Japanese, the conversation would never get anywhere.
