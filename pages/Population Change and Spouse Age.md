In traditional societies that allow polygamy, polygyny is made possible by delaying the first marriage of men. If the population ratio of men and women is approximately equal, this must be the case. Sometimes the "delay" is not a regulation, but a common belief that a man should not marry unless he has a certain income and status.

The "ingenuity" in the realization of polygamy reflects the structure of the population pyramid as well as the disparity in wealth. If we shift our perspective to an aging society with low fertility, we can see that the rate of unmarriage will inevitably increase unless people of the same age or younger husbands and older wives get married.

In the past, the unmarried rate among women was high. In the past, the unmarried rate among women was high, but the unmarried rate among men has been increasing since the population pyramid shape was reversed due to the declining birthrate.

> In Western antiquity, the ratio of male to female population was not equal due to female infanticide, so there was a tendency to marry with an extreme age difference to achieve monogamy. In ancient times in the West, because the ratio of male to female population was not equal due to the abandonment of female infants, there was a tendency toward extreme age difference marriages in order to achieve monogamy. In an aging society with low fertility that supports monogamy, the increase in the percentage of unmarried people is (inevitably) caused by a cause other than income inequality.
