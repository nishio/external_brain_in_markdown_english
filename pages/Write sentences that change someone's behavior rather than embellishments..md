I threw a lazy voice input of my thoughts in the bath into o3 and this is what I got.

original
    - [[order]]
    - [[ornate text]].
- [[long winded sentence]]
- Sufficient substance does not exist, though,
    - I want to produce it as if it were inside.
    - I want them to perceive it as if it were worth it.
        - It's a worthless sentence.
- at such a time
    - order
        - How great a human being you are writing about.
        - How you are having an experience that others are not.
        - I know all these words, and it's great, isn't it?"
    - Sentences with lots of medals like that.
    - [[Kerenmi]].
- The densely packed text is compressed and crammed, cutting down on the amount of content that would exceed the limited number of pages.
- On the other hand, those who have no substance [[padding]] and increase the number of pages.
- Producing something that does not inherently lead to value is not production.
- If you fill pages by painstakingly spinning out useless and worthless sentences, that is not production.
- If 100,000 people read the book and even just 1% of them feel that their lives have changed for the better because of it, then we have made 1,000 lives better.
- This is a major contribution to human civilization.
    - [[Contribution to Civilization]]
