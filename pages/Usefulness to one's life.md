title: "Usefulness to one's life"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Who has historically advocated the position that pragmatism is true or false according to [[usefulness]] for [[My Life]]?

- The most direct statement of "usefulness = truth" was made by [[William James]] in his 1907 Pragmatism Lecture VI: "The 'true thing' is, in short, what is [[[useful]] (expedient) in the way our thoughts proceed," and he explained truth in terms of the practical utility of this He explained the truth in terms of the practical utility of "[[cash-value]]" ([[Brock University ]]).

    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> You mention cash-value, but "useful in the way we think" reminds me of [[thought economy theory]].

- [[F.C.S. Schiller]] (English pragmatist/humanist) developed the same point with the formulation "What works (works) is true". James himself introduced it as such in Lecture VI, and Schiller's main book, [[Studies in Humanism]] (1907), develops the same line of argument. ([Brock University](https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1907/James_1907_06.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
(With only historical facts for contrast)
- [[C.S. Parse]] ([[parse]]) linked truth to "[[the opinion reached by the community at the ultimate of inquiry]]" and distinguished it from the short-term utility of the individual. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2025/entries/truth-pragmatic/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - [[John Dewey]] instrumentally rephrased the "truth" concept as "[[warranted assertibility]]" ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
In short, James (along with Schiller) is the historical representative who spoke truth with a strong emphasis on "usefulness to one's life" in the foreground.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>James, Perth and Dewey seem to be saying totally different things, how are they related?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT5/icon' alt='GPT5.icon' height="19.5"/>The "connection" and "division of roles" among the three parties
- Common Core (Pragmatic Maxim)
    - The idea that "the meaning of a concept is exhausted by the practical consequences of that concept."
    - It was formulated by Perls in the late 19th century, popularized by James for the general public, and developed by Dewey as a methodology for scientific inquiry and social practice.

- Division of roles (where to place emphasis)
    - Perth: Semantic Criteria and the Logic of Inquiry
        - Truth = "[[an opinion to which the community converges at the extreme end of endless inquiry]]". Emphasis on long-term, [[public]] consensus, not individual convenience. Later renamed "[[pragmaticism]]" to distance it from Jamesianism.
                - [[careful deliberation]] や[[社会的意思決定]]との関連がありそう<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - James: [[the pragmatic theory of truth]] (CASH VALUE)
        - Truth = "the actual usefulness (successfully guiding an action) before experience". Characterized by speaking from a ground close to the concrete life and preferences of the individual. Popularizes the idea of parsing, but presents the theory of truth in a more plastic way.
    - Dewey: instrumentalism/methods of inquiry
        - Rephrasing the word truth as substantially "guaranteed assertability. Embedding pragmatism in the process of [[collective problem solving]] as experimentalism linking schooling, democracy, and technology.

How it is "related" (key points)
1. the starting point is the perspective ([[meaning = practical result]]).
2. popularized by James (extending the semantic criterion to truth theory and emphasizing [[individual usefulness]]).
3. institutionalized by Dewey (reconfigured as a procedure of scientific, educational, and democratic inquiry, with emphasis on [[public problem solving]] rather than individuals).

Similarities and differences (shortest comparison)
_
| Perspectives Perth James Dewey |
| -- |
| Main focus Semantic criteria of concepts, logic of inquiry Pragmatic theory of truth Methods of inquiry, social implementation |
| Truth Long-term convergence of community Working and useful (context-dependent, individual-leaning) Guaranteed assertability (procedure-dependent, public-leaning) |
| Tone Anti-Psychologism, Realism-leaning Pluralism, Empiricism Experimentalism, Instrumentalism |
In short, while the three parties share **the same core (outcome-based meaning making)**,
- Perspective is meaning and long-term exploration,
- James is a truth in line with personal experience,
- Dewey is a public problem-solving process
The relationship between the two is that they were developed by shifting the focus of each to the other.
