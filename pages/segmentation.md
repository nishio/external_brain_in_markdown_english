title: "segmentation"
---

    - The concept of [[double division]] in [Saussure
    - Humans ignore some [[differences]] and focus on some differences
        - It thereby divides what could actually be a continuous value into several sets
            - Perhaps due to cognitive limitations.
            - In short, [vector quantization
        - This is [[articulation]], segmentation
    - phonological segment
        - e.g. [[I only focus on what I distinguish.]].
    - semantic segment
        - Carving up the world according to conceptual units

### Summary of notes
.
According to Saussure's concept of dual segmentation, humans ignore some differences and emphasize some differences. This divides what could take on continuous values into several sets. This is due to the limitations of our cognitive abilities and can be called vector quantization. This is called segmentalization. Segmentalization can be divided into phonological and semantic segmentation.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The Notebook and the 16th: Fun Fragments of "Segmentation" address the common topic of Saussure's notion of segmentation in linguistics. Both emphasize the idea of humans segmenting the world.

### deep thinking
Saussure's concept of the double segmentation provides an opportunity to think deeply about the limits of human cognitive abilities and their impact. In particular, it encourages us to reevaluate our cognitive processes in terms of how we understand the world and how we segment it.

Saussure's concept of the dual segmentation encourages us to reevaluate the process of cognition in terms of how we understand the world and how we segment it.
