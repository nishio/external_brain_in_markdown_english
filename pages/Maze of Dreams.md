I gave the notes of the dream to [[AI Shaman]], which I created using the ChatGPT (GPT4) prompt, and had him interpret them. Previous: [[Ancient castles and future echoes]].

# dream notes
We walked further and further down the open-air corridor. Shriveled morning glories and other plants are placed in a jumble. It looks more like a veranda than a corridor. When I reach the end, the sky is so beautiful that I can't help but gaze at it. The next morning, I remember that I did not call my wife and I look at Google Map to see where I am, but I am puzzled by the map of a foreign country. As I am puzzled, it changes to a map of Japan, and it seems that I am in an elementary school. I don't know why. I wonder if I entered there when I was walking randomly from the campus of the university. Note the handrail with the sticky stuff on it.

 prompt ver.2

```
You are a shaman. I received the following oracle. The meaning of the word is not a fixed meaning as per the dictionary, but a soft spreading cloud.
1: Interpret paragraph by paragraph, focusing on movement and metaphor, not abstract concepts.
2: Take a softer view of the meaning of words and find the relationship between paragraphs.
3: Look at the whole picture and find the meaning.
4: Give it a soft title.

(Memo of dream)

Title: "Maze of Dreams

Paragraph-by-paragraph interpretation based on this oracle:

The first paragraph symbolizes [[the journey of life]]. The [[open-air corridor]] represents a [[path of choice and decision]], and the [[morning glory]] suggests [[opportunity]] or [[possibility]]. The [[beauty of the sky]] offers [[new perspectives]] and insights. The next morning, the foreign map on Google Maps is a metaphor for [[anxiety about unknown possibilities]], and the elementary school scene suggests that life's journey [[takes an unexpected turn]].

The second paragraph highlights change and confusion. The moment of change from a map of Japan to an elementary school signifies a [[change in life direction]] or [[connection to the past]]. The walk from the college canvas reflects [[a spirit of exploration]] or [[a journey of self-discovery]]. The [[sticky railing]] indicates having lessons from past experiences and difficulties.

Taken as a whole, the story explores the changes and disruptions in life's journey and the exploration of unknown possibilities. The protagonist finds a new perspective on a quiet morning and feels a connection to the past as he moves forward.

The title "Maze of Dreams" reflects the central theme of the story - change and exploration - and suggests that the story unfolds through a dream-like experience.

No, it isn't. Sticky is black.
- Okay, it's coal tar.
    - > Once used as a preservative for wood, such as sleepers and wooden poles, and applied to surfaces as a coating for tin roofs [coal tar - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/コールタール).
- I remember accidentally touching it when I was a kid and getting black goo on my hands.
    - > Steeple railing is a lesson from past experiences and difficulties
        - [[Lessons from the past]].
    - You might get black goo on your hands if you carelessly touch things.
    - You have to have a tissue to wipe it off.
- abstraction
    - If something [[unpleasant]] clings to you, you must throw it away.
    - Things that [[cling to]] cannot be [[discarded]] on their own, so we need things that can be discarded.

The "moment when the map changes from a map of Japan to an elementary school" is a little different from what you conveyed, but it seems to me it could be read as "the moment when the map changes to a map of Japan."<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
>  The beauty of the sky is a new insight
>  Foreign maps are anxiety about unknown possibilities
>  Elementary school scenes are life's journey taking unexpected turns.
>  Moments that turn into a map of Japan are a change of direction in life and a connection to the past.
>  Walking from the college canvas is an exploration
If you're going on and on and on, on an exploratory basis, you'll get good insights, but then you'll wonder, "Where am I now?"
- The map is foreign and unsettling.
- But it turns into a map of Japan.
    - (Detailing the description) At this time, this map of Japan is not a "place I know" but a "place I don't know at all" and I don't know why I am there, I know I am in an elementary school, but I don't know why I am there
        - But I think the fact that it's now in Japanese is a bit of a relief.

The hallway itself is not quite as picturesque as it appears.
