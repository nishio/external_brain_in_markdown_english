Temporary utopia established only among self-selected art participants

In general, process-oriented art practice is positioned as an attempt to test fundamental questions such as "[[what is]] consensus building" and "[[what is]] the public sphere" in the field of art. The procedures and relationships themselves are the medium, and exist as an open project that continues to generate rather than as a finished product. The audience becomes active participants in the process, and the boundaries between artistic and social experiences are dissolved. This kind of art is also a kind of social experiment, which aims to work on democratic institutions and people's psychology in order to promote transformation.
However, such efforts are often limited to the institutional framework of art (museums and biennials), and it is said that it is not easy for their impact to spread throughout society. Some critics have harshly described it as "a temporary utopia that can only be established among self-selected art participants. However, even in such a limited space, it is highly significant to demonstrate a new consensus-building model and vision of community on the ground. For the participants, it will be an opportunity to realize an experimental public sphere, and for the observers, it will be a chance to think about existing institutions relative to each other.
One final point is that art, which makes the process into a work of art, can also include failures and disharmony. In the usual political process, a meeting that fails to reach a consensus ends in "failure," but in the case of art, learning and criticism can be generated from this process. For example, even if the discussion in the aforementioned participatory work breaks down, if the process itself is recorded and presented as a work of art, it can be used as material to examine with the audience why agreement could not be reached. This is a degree of freedom allowed only in the context of art, and the cross-disciplinary findings have the potential to be fed back into ordinary social systems as well.
