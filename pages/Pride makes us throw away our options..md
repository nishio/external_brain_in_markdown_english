title: "Pride makes us throw away our options."
---

- When a hand is reached out, it [[flings off]].
- Rationally speaking, [[options]] that do not need to be dispelled are dispelled by the action of [[emotion]], such as [[pride]].
- It is difficult to grab the hand again once it has been swept away
    - The damage to pride is even greater.
    - When there is no strong incentive to reach out, it is natural to keep your distance
            - Never try to pet [[Dogs that bite]] again

- [[Diary of an old man]]
