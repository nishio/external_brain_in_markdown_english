title: "Technology makes the ambiguities of democracy visible."

- [[technology]] makes [[ambiguity]] of [[democracy]] [visualization (data, results, etc.)
after  [[Can democracy "really" be updated?]]
> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1836966321130721344) By the way, to add a little about the recent 7.5 hour event with Yasuno-san and Katsura-san (although what was discussed is already vague), in my opinion I have a suspicion that concepts such as democracy and [[careful deliberation]] are so vaguely defined that it may not be possible to set the necessary goals for technical implementation.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1836966996531105858) And here is the important part: this "ambiguity" is not something that arises from a lack of academic research and technology, but is fundamentally the concept of democracy and deliberation in the first place. It is something fundamental to the concept of democracy and deliberation, and can never be removed. In other words, democracy and deliberation cannot be improved <in principle> by technology.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1836967420675911926) So what technology can do is rather make visible the "ambiguity" of democracy and deliberation by increasing the freedom of information and judgment, I think that is actually what is happening now. Now that I think about it, that is what I wanted to say in "Philosophy of Correctability.

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1836967745646383167) In other words, there is indeed a deep relationship between democracy and technology. However, it is not the case that technology improves democracy. My tentative conclusion is that the more technology develops, the more the "ambiguity" of democracy becomes apparent, and that's OK. I hope this will be of some help.
