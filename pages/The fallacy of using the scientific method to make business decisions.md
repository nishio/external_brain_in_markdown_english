- Therefore, we tend to try to collect enough [Number of samples
- There is a 95% probability that this [[hypothesis]] is correct!"
- In business, it doesn't matter whether it's 96% or 94%.
- Even if the hypothesis has a 10% chance of being correct.
- If the resulting [[Profit Expectations]] exceed the cost, then "[[Great value bets]]."
- Whether a bet is profitable or not and how much you will lose if you are unlucky ([[Loss Limitation]]) are important in business.
- Spending time and money on data collection in an attempt to increase the probability that a hypothesis is correct to 95% or more is basically a bad strategy.
    - It is a mistake to confuse [[Business Decisions]] with the procedures for recognizing universal knowledge in science.
