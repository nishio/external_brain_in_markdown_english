I don't want a woman who judges a man by whether he has nose hair or not. Please introduce me to a woman who can look more [[inside]]." There are many men who are at the level where even Gandhi would hit them with a running shoe.

We are not merely pointing out the nose hair, but "the depravity of not being able to do even the rudiments of cleanliness, such as cutting nose hair when you are going to meet a woman you might marry, and the thinking that led you to do so."

These two tweets are about men's attitudes toward nose hair in marriage (marriage activity). Below is a detailed explanation.
... .xgk_1's view explains that the issue of nose hair itself is not superficial, but points to a deeper problem: the "lack of cleanliness" and the "depraved thinking" that led to it.
In short, these tweets address nose hair as an example of how cleanliness, self-care, and respect for the other person in marriage life symbolize deeper attitudinal issues than superficial issues. The message here is that if you are serious about marriage, your impression of the other person and your own self-care are important.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>The expression "depraved thinking" refers here to deviation from moral, ethical, or social standards, or indifference to those standards.

In the context of xgk_1's tweet, he points out how men neglect even the basic aspects of cleanliness, such as cutting their nose hair, even though they are meeting a potential marriage partner. This "depraved thinking" can be interpreted as indicating a lack of self-control, respect for others, and awareness of social expectations.

In other words, "depravity" in this case refers to an attitude of not fulfilling the minimum effort and responsibility for one's own appearance and behavior, because it is considered a deviation from social norms and ethical expectations. Such an attitude is considered a particularly important issue in the context of marital activity, as it can be seen as a lack of respect for the other person.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>There is indeed a contradiction between the action of paying for advice and then not following that advice. Let us consider some aspects of this situation.

- Mismatch between investment and results: the act of paying to get advice from an expert usually indicates that one sees value in that advice and intends to act on it. Ignoring that advice can also appear to be disloyal to one's own investment (time, money, effort).

- Trust in experts: Without trust in the expert or consultant providing the advice, there may be no incentive to take the advice and implement it. If this lack of trust is evident, then the advice should not have been given in the first place.

- introspection and [[lack of self-awareness]]: The discrepancy between the behavior of seeking advice for self-improvement and the attitude of ignoring that advice may indicate a lack of self-awareness or the possibility of not seriously wanting to improve oneself.

- Quality of advice: Of course, not all advice is appropriate. If the advice is inappropriate or does not fit your personal situation, it may be understandable to disregard it.

In this context, the behavior of people who receive marriage advice but ignore it may suggest multiple potential problems, such as [[lack of motivation for self-improvement]], distrust of the advice, or [[contradictory values]]. In particular, an attitude of ignoring basic advice, such as in the nose hair case, may suggest a [[lack of]] respect for the other person or a more serious values problem.
