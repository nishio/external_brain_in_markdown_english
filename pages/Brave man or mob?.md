title: "Brave man or mob?"

> [chokudai](https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/1745275333342056693) Since I grew up with [[Dracula]], I have the sense that "it's natural to be a [[hero]] in games," and I think about it based on that assumption, but do young people today have a stronger sense that "it's natural to be a [[mob]] in games" because they grew up with [[shadow games]]? But do you think that today's young people, who grew up playing shadow games, have a stronger sense of "in games, it's natural to be a [[mob]] because there are bad people? This seems to be a huge generational difference.
