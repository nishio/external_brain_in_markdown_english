If someone tries to go outside the [[group]], you pull them back with good intentions and say, "Don't go outside! but if they go [[outside]], they become [[indifferent]].

> @5ducks5 Japan does not put pressure on those who are deemed "outside" to be sympathetic. If you can win the label of "[[sport]]" or "[[outsider]]", it's a whole lot easier. When you are on this line, some people pressure you to go back to "inside" from [[kindness]], but the point is that it depends on your own determination.

- [[peer pressure]] is a pullback of [good faith
