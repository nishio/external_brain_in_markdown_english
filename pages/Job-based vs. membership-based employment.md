- Comparison of [[job-based employment]] and [membership-based employment

- [[job-based employment]] is a system in which employees are hired based on the specific job or role they are to perform. This system is common in Western countries, including the United States. In this system, employees are often hired for their skills related to a specific job, and employment is closely tied to that job. Employment mobility within and between firms is relatively high, and employees may change jobs in search of better opportunities, higher salaries, and more challenging assignments.

On the other hand, [[membership-based employment]] is traditionally common in Japan. Under this system, the employee is considered a member of the company, and loyalty and long-term employment are emphasized. Rather than being hired for a specific job, employees are often hired based on their overall fit with the company and are expected to work in a variety of roles and departments over time. This system fosters a strong sense of belonging and loyalty among employees, but may also result in less job mobility than job-based employment.

## [[Termination regulations]] in Japan and in the U.S.
Japan: Japanese [[labor law]] is known to be quite strict when it comes to employee [[termination]]. Because the membership-based employment system emphasizes [[long-term employment]], it is difficult for companies to fire employees without substantial cause. Employers must provide concrete evidence of poor performance or misconduct, and even then, they are encouraged to find alternative solutions such as reassignment or training before resorting to termination. In addition, Japanese social and cultural norms discourage frequent job changes, further encouraging employment stability.

U.S.: The U.S. follows a more job-based employment model, adopting an "at-will" employment principle, meaning that in most cases, employers can fire employees at any time without warning, except for illegal reasons (such as discrimination), unless the reason is prohibited by law. This gives employers greater flexibility in managing their employees, but for employees, it makes employment less stable than in Japan.

In summary, the differences between job-based and membership-based employment reflect broader cultural and legal differences in workplace practices and attitudes toward job security and employee mobility. Japan's culture of strict termination restrictions and emphasis on long-term employment contributes to a work environment that emphasizes stability and loyalty, in contrast to the more flexible and individualistic approach found in the United States.

- [[diversity]] and cross-training: Employees are often encouraged to develop a wide range of skills and assume different roles throughout their careers. This diversity allows companies to quickly redeploy their workforce to meet changing business needs and market conditions without the need to hire from the outside.
- [[internal mobility]]: Companies leverage internal mobility to adapt to changes in the environment. Employees can move between different departments, projects, or group companies, allowing the organization to address gaps or take advantage of new opportunities quickly. This [[liquidity]] is facilitated by the employee's broad alignment with the company's overall goals and culture, rather than focusing on his or her original job description.
- Long-term perspective: By focusing on long-term employment, companies are encouraged to invest in the [[development]] of their employees, including training in new skills and competencies that they anticipate will be needed in the future. This investment not only benefits individuals, but also helps companies retain talent as needs change.
