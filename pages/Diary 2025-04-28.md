> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1916436848639119742) Evaluating high quality human-written tests, AI-generated tests, [[LLM E2E test]] signals by [[Browser-use]], etc., while mixing them. Evaluating mixed signals, without aiming for All Green (LLM E2E test is probabilistic to begin with), there could be a more risk-taking and cost-effective flow to make a Go/NoGo decision...?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1916666642475745540) I think there is going to be a shift from the traditional concept of test-driven AI agents in the age of AI agents, where all tests are expected to succeed, to [[ensemble]] a bunch of [[probabilistic discriminators]] to make them stronger. I think there is going to be a shift equivalent to the paradigm shift from rule-based to machine learning with if statements.
