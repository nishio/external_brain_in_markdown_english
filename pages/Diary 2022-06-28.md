The more I read, the more I realized that what I was customizing in the process of using the KJ method was what Jiro Kawakita called "fireworks," and what I was trying to do in this study session was to "work on live themes that the students themselves are actually dealing with" (p. 314) in "Thinking Fireworks.

Well, we should be happy that we were able to produce the same thing as Jiro Kawakita. Jiro Kawakita cannot do programming.
