> We are developing this system to create an environment where students can collaborate with the generative AI under the supervision of the teacher, assuming that [[lessons]] incorporating [[Generative AI]] will be conducted in the classroom.
> We are currently conducting a demonstration test of a prototype version of the system and are working to test and improve the hypothesis by incorporating it into actual classes.
> We are accepting those who are willing to cooperate in a demonstration experiment to verify the effectiveness of &box Classroom, such as conducting a class incorporating the generated AI.
