Those who predict failure drag their feet in fulfilling the prophecy.

- [[stand ready (to do)]]
- [[prophecy of failure]] for [[fulfillment of prophecy]] [[sabotage]].
- Different from those who give [[improvement ideas]] for success.
- [[follow my suggestion or you will fail]], type of [[prediction]].
    - Assumption that [[I know better]].
            - [[We cannot know the totality of what others know.]]
    - [[desire to control others]].

Priority should be given to [[making a neutral person positive]] rather than making a person who gives [[negative signals]] positive.
- [[do not respond to rebuttal with a rebuttal]].
    - No [[signal]] in [[Productive Discussion]].

    - [[self-generated alienation]]
