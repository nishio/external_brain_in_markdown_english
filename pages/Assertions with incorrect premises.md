title: "Assertions with incorrect premises"
---

How should we handle the false assertion of [[ASSUMPTION]] by citizens who assume things that are not true are true?

There are a fair number of people who don't make the distinction between "I wish the world were X" and "the world is X."
- Or, "Plagiarism of painting style by a generative AI is copyright infringement."
    - Negatively labeling as "plagiarism" an act that is not copyright infringement and is not legally problematic at this time.
- With regard to a case in which the court found the perpetrator not guilty, "it is not good that the perpetrator is not charged with a crime".
    - He is not guilty, so he is not a "perpetrator".
