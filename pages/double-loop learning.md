title: "double-loop learning"
---

- The story is that we need not only an optimization loop such as [[PDCA cycle]], but also a loop to question whether the goal of the optimization itself is correct.
A concept proposed by [[Chris Argiris.]] and [[Donald Schon.]] in 1978 in [[Organizational Learning]].

>  [[single-loop learning]] is to solve problems according to a [[framework]] of ideas and behaviors that are already in place.
>  Double-loop learning means abandoning existing frameworks and incorporating new frameworks of thought and action.
>  A concept proposed by American organizational psychologists Chris Argillis and Donald Schoen in 1978 in their book "[[organizational learning]].
>  It is difficult for an organization to survive and adapt to its environment with only single-loop learning.
>  The [[stereotype]] in the past [[success story]] is [[unlearned]] by itself, new knowledge and frameworks are learned from the outside in a double-loop learning process, and these are then iterated and reinforced through single-loop learning again.
>  It is said that only organizations that can continue this cycle repeatedly can maintain their [[competitive edge]].
