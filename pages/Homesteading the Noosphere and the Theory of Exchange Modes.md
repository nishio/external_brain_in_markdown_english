A Consideration of the Relationship between [[Eric S. Raymond]]'s "[[Homesteading the Noosphere]]" and [[Kojin Karatani]]'s "[[Theory of Exchange Modes]]"

From "Homesteading the Noosphere"(Japanese translation):
>  Most of the methods of human organization are adaptive behaviors in response to scarcity and desire. Each method has separate means of acquiring social status.
- [[Means of Acquiring Social Status]]
- >  The simplest method is the [[command hierarchy]]. ... The allocation of scarce goods is carried out by a [[central authority]] backed by [[military force]]. ... Social status is mainly determined by the ability to access [[coercive power]].
    - This is [[Exchange Mode B]].
- >  Our society is primarily based on [[exchange economy]]. ... The allocation of scarce goods is done [[decentralized]] through [[exchange]] and [[voluntary cooperation]]... Social status is mainly determined by the control of things (not necessarily material).
    - This is [[Exchange Mode C]].
- >  ... There is a completely different third model that is not well recognized by anyone other than anthropologists. This is the [[gift culture]].
    - >  [[Gift culture is an adaptation to abundance, not scarcity]]. ... Social status is determined not by what you control but by what you give away.
        - Original English: Gift cultures are adaptations not to scarcity but to abundance. ... In gift cultures, social status is determined not by what you control but by what you give away.
        - Related: [[Wealth is not measured by how much you have, but by how much you can give]] ([[Larry Wall]]).
    - Is this [[Exchange Mode A]]?
        - It is closely related to Exchange Mode A in terms of gift culture.
        - However, it seems like a [[low-resolution]] expression to identify it as Exchange Mode A.
        - The point that it is an adaptation to abundance, not scarcity, is important.
            - The exchange in the era when Exchange Mode A was born was the exchange of [[tangible goods]].
            - The invention of technology gave birth to [[digital goods]].
            - Digital goods have a low [[cost of replication]], so they become abundant as soon as they are created.
        - From the invention of the printing press to the advancement of the internet, the cost of replicating and transporting written words has decreased.
            - This led to the emergence of the academic community, a community of knowledge exchange.
            - Knowledge exchange is also a form of exchange.
            - The replicable nature is similar to digital goods.
        - These can be considered as the birth of a [[new exchange mode]].
            - Uncertain whether to call this Exchange Mode D, as the boundary between A and D is not clear.
            - Kojin Karatani seems to find a greater meaning in Exchange Mode D, so summarizing a grand plan into something smaller.
            - Personally, I don't believe that the diverse range of exchange activities can be classified into the four frameworks of A to D.
