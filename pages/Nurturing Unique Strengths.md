title: "Nurturing Unique Strengths"

This diagram illustrates the [[Assumption That Adults Are Superior to Children]].

From this situation, there are two approaches to [[Education]].

One approach is where adults compare children to themselves or to an imagined "[[Ideal State]]", pointing out deficiencies like "You can't do this" or "You can't do that", and then filling in those gaps.

The other approach focuses on praising the [[Unique]] aspects with "That's great!" and further nurturing those strengths.

It's not a simple matter of saying which approach is better, but personally, I want to be involved in the latter form of education.

This is possibly related to what I wrote in November 2017 about [[Developing Subordinates]].
