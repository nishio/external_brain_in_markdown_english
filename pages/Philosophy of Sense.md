>  For example, in the case of interior design, if you go halfway and try to create a European-style luxurious atmosphere, you can imagine cases where a false sense of luxury would leak out, can't you?
>
>  These cases are a state of being obsessed with symbols and meanings. It is not a state of bad taste, but a state of being "unaware of taste.
>
>  Another way to deal with this is to increase "meaning input = European context here".
>
>  The author proposes to "change the playing field of meaning.
>
>  > In other words, we get off the "reproduction of a model" that is considered to be absolutely good for something.
>
>  Specifically, "focus on rhythm before meaning," which is the underlying message of this book.
