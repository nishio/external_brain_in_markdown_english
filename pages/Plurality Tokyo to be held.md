> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1637739023975297024) By the way, we are not planning to increase the number of participants too much, so please do your best to appeal "I am the one with Legitimacy and I deserve to participate". Please do your best to appeal to the people who have Legitimacy and are suitable to participate in the event. I'm calling out as far as I can see to some extent, but there are some things I can't see, so I need to guess myself. We'll also have legitimacy media participating, so there's that, too.
