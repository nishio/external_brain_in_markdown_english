In July of 2024, something interesting happens.
> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1790001995866067204/history) This July, we are in a situation where we can only assume that something interesting will happen. Partly by coincidence, but also because of the various people who have bet on this timing. It's going to be a treasure that will last a lifetime.

> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1790008183165006126) We don't plan to hold an event that attracts many people for several years, so I am sorry but we can only work with those who have supported us this time.
>  I am convinced that this will be a critically important event that will create the next decade.

I heard about an interesting event happening in July from a completely different channel, so I introduced [[Funding the Commons Tokyo 2024]] to them, and they said it was interesting after all.

["I heard about an interesting event that will happen in July through a completely different channel" is [[Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Election 2024]].
    - [[Late May 2024, a turbulent time.]]
    - I told [[Takahiro Yasuno]] that Audrey and Glen were coming.
