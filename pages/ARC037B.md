- Thoughts.
    - If the number of edges is the number of vertices - 1 for the connected component, then tree
    - Since the total number of edges is known, is it sufficient to find and calculate the number of connected components? â†’This is wrong.
        - There could be a connected component that has multiple extra edges.
    - Since there are at most 5050 edges, there is plenty of room to find the connected components and then count the number of edges for each connected component.
        - For each edge, one vertex belongs to
- Official Explanation
        - [[Find the connected components with DFS]]
    - If there are already visited vertices other than the direction you came from, there is a closed road.
