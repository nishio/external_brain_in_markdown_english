title: "The desire to be underestimated"
---

When I found out that [[Yamabushi]] is certified after climbing a mountain three times, I said, "Wouldn't it be interesting to take the Yamabushi title and introduce yourself by saying, 'I am a Yamabushi' for the first time?

When I told him that I had a desire to be "abused," he agreed, but since the earliest I could get a Yamabushi was three years from now, we decided to come up with an "abusive self-introduction" that could still be used today, and we concluded that "I am involved in educational projects for middle and high school students" would be a good choice.

Analysis of why this is underestimated
- Targets middle and high school students: recommended for middle and high school students with low self-esteem because the age difference gives them an advantage position.
- Education: no short-term "failures" because it takes 10 years for results to become apparent
- Involvement: in other words, I don't drive the project myself, I simply help out.
