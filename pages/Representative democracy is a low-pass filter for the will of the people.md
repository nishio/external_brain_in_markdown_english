title: "Representative democracy is a low-pass filter for the will of the people"
---

from  [[The World and Japan 100 years from now How will the Internet change the world?]]

[[Representative democracy]] is [[a low-pass filter for the will of the people]].
> ([[Hiroki Azuma]]) Desire is what we desire at this moment... After a desire is fulfilled, it often happens that one wonders why one spent money on such and such a thing.... Representative democracy only reflects the will of the people over a very long period of time, four or six years, for example, so that system is a deterrent to desire. ... It takes time to change politicians, it takes time to elect them, and it's just so relaxed.
- by the slow pace of representative democracy.[[民意]]の[[ローパスフィルタ]]として機能して、 [[wild enthusiasm]] が通過しないようになっているのだな<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
> The media with a different sense of time from that assumed by parliamentary democracy have emerged. And they were also media that were very suited to the embodiment of desire.
>  When parliamentary democracy was first established, we only considered the aggregation of wills over a long period of time, but as time went by in the 20th and 21st centuries, it became possible to aggregate wills over shorter and shorter periods of time. As time went by in the 20th and 21st centuries, it became possible to aggregate wills in shorter and shorter units.
- brought about by technological advances.[[速い情報伝達]]が [[wild enthusiasm]] の[[民意]]に占める割合を上昇させた<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Arendt, especially in "The Origins of Totalitarianism" (1951) and "On Revolution" (1963), spoke of the danger that the instantaneous spread of information by the media would create [[short-term fervor]] and passions that would strongly influence political decisions. She was concerned that such fervor could prevent deep individual thought and debate, making it easier for [[totalitarianism]] to take hold.
