title: "How to build relationships within the community"

One-line summary: Relationships are naturally built through participation and ongoing interaction in the community, and these bonds are further strengthened when working together at technical conferences.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1699789905130660174) When I joined the Ruby community 13 years ago, I felt a bit lonely because I couldn't join the [[established community relationships]], but after showing up many times However, as I came to the Ruby community many times, the number of people I could talk to increased, and when I went to a meeting like this and talked with various people as if I was an old friend, I might have seemed like a person in the [[established human relations]], and I felt that I was not a member of the Ruby community.

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1699789908150542803) Well, even back then, I probably didn't have that much of a [[completed human relationship]], and I was only able to talk a little after meeting with people many times, It is important to go to interesting places and try to communicate with them as many times as possible, and I would like to create and promote such places as often as possible.

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1699793829786968079) In my case, I was too young and wandered around the area for a short period of time, and I am aware that I was taken care of by many people and put in a lot of trouble. I am very grateful to all the people who helped me and gave me a lot of trouble....

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1699795262062158307) I know I said that not everyone is so close to each other in terms of completed relationships, but if I had to guess, I'd say that working on the staff of a technical conference or something like that brings you closer together. I'd say that if you go through the dead line, you'll feel closer to each other! I'm sure you guys will get to know each other better!

> [tadsan](https://twitter.com/tadsan/status/1699800337270669527) I completely forgot what I was going to say first, but if you see me anywhere, feel free to say "Hi! I'll be glad to help you out!
