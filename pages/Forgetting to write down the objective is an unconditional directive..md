title: "Forgetting to write down the objective is an unconditional directive."

Please X" appears to be [[Unconditional Instructions]].
The first half of "If you want to do Y, do X" may be omitted to take this form when the author implicitly assumes that the reader wants to do Y.
When the implicit assumption "the reader wants to Y" is incorrect, the reader misinterprets the work as "necessary" when it is not.

If the statement of fact is, "If you do X, you can do Y," it prevents forgetting to write Y.

- This is common in blog posts and the like. They write things like "First, rewrite the configuration file like this" without saying what they are going to do.
    - It is also common in [[company rule]]. Forgetting what the rule was made for, only the rule stands on its own.
    - [[Clarification of objectives]]
