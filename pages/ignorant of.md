title: "ignorant of"

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853669342396993974) Sorry for all this talk. And I know I've tweeted this many times, but when I tried to get on a train on a date with a woman I used to like very much and was driving me crazy wanting to go out with her, she got mad at me.
>  "Didn't you see the old lady just now trying to get in?　Why did you skip the turn?"

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853669671125541060) I didn't see her. Not physically, but mentally, I didn't see the old lady getting on the train at all, and I got on the train so that she could slip by me. I was told this by a woman I liked, and liked, and liked, and liked.
>  I think I was probably very smug and not listening sincerely at the time.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853670248110846368) I think I just felt so embarrassed, so hard, and I think I even uttered some excuse. The woman was properly offended, saying "I don't like that kind of thing," but I seem to recall that she took a "no-hate" attitude, so to speak, in response.
>  If I recognize their "[[dislike]]" here, I will be a "dislike" to them for the rest of my life.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853670594694537384) I think I felt like I could never pull it off. I wondered if I admitted to disliking it, would I be infinitely disliked and have to accept it all? I don't want to have that pointed out to me. I don't want someone else, especially a woman I love and adore, to point out what I don't like about myself. I am not perfect, and I will be seen through.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853670949096448479) I feel like I've been "hating" like crazy already. I ignored them, or talked about something else. I will always remember the look on the woman's face. I don't know what I did. In the first place, I didn't see the old lady, I ignored her and got on the train, and my mental laziness was terrible. How can such a man be happy with a woman?

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853671389330649525) But I was scared. If I admit my fault here, I'll be stuck with it forever. I can't stand in front of women as my perfect self. I can't stand in front of women. I won't be able to talk. I was afraid. I can't talk openly to people unless I can at least rouse myself, ignore it, pretend it didn't happen, and move on. I absolutely hate that I have flaws. Don't see them, the flaws.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853671842420273607) I only want you to see the good things about me. What's wrong with you, identify with me, get used to it, or you can follow me, I'm perfect all the time. I don't fix myself. It's your laziness, because you are the one who makes it perfect.
>  I like you, you know.
>  So why are you pointing out my shortcomings?
>  Unforgivable.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853672136847831546) I wonder if he felt like .......
>  Also, when I "like" someone, I assimilate and feel like a relative. So when someone points out a flaw, you say, "What?　I don't get it. You're me, so you do something about it. I'm perfect, so don't point out that I'm not. I'm perfect, so don't point out what's not perfect because it's wrong.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853672662041862287) when you are in a lover's relationship with a woman,
>  "Usually I self-deprecate and laugh at myself, that's my artistic style, and I've lived my life self-deprecating like that, so naturally you, who are my relatives, treat me the same way I treat myself, and treat me shabbily, but that's because you're my relatives, and that's genuine love."
>  There was a time when I had a mindset like that.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853673297248202926) I was good at self-deprecating laughter, often worked as a yes-man for my superiors, and was kicked, punched, and taken advantage of by the bosses I served, but was also patted on the back of the neck and told, "You I was very good at my job and had a good reputation. I had a very good reputation for my work.
>  Once it becomes a family member, the violence (including mentality) goes to the family members.

> [namecatbeliever](https://x.com/namecatbeliever/status/1853673843925348360) I guess I was a moral harasser. I guess it must have been hard for my ex-lover who dated me for 6 years, now that I think about it. I still can't forgive him for some things.
>  But, you know, I'm sure I would have caused some of my unforgiveness.
>  I guess this is how I would put the "no nay-no" experience into words.

> [sinatuhiko613](https://x.com/sinatuhiko613/status/1854071452204720330) Interesting. The psychology of wanting to "pretend" that the one was not there, because there is a feeling that if you admit the one bad thing, you will see through the 100 things behind it. I can understand the feeling very well, because I wanted to be myself without any faults in front of the person I love.
>  However, from their point of view, that one doesn't mean it didn't exist, but rather it leads to the second flaw, "refusing to admit it," in addition to the first flaw. They don't disappear, but are strung together until the 100th flaw.
>  There is only one way to break this. Admit fault and change. I think this is both extremely easy and difficult.
>  What I want people who "hate" in the pattern of the tweaker to know is that it is not disingenuous to admit that you have faults and that you are wrong. On the contrary, it turns into a positive: "I am a person who can admit and change my faults.
>  I think it is extremely important in both love and marriage to have someone who can change you for the better. Each other, of course.
>  One point I would add is that you should not say to someone with that kind of mentality, "You wanted to be cool in front of the girl you like, but your pride gets in the way and you can't be honest, so it can't be helped, yoshi yoshi.
>  I wonder how Tweety got out of that and came to be able to analyze himself in the past.
