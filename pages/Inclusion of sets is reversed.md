An example where X encompasses Y and Y encompasses X, depending on the viewpoint.
- The set of "knowledge shared by A and B" is
- Since it encompasses the set of "knowledge shared by Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C,"
- Shared knowledge f(S) in a set S of persons" means that f(S2) contains f(S1) when S1 contains S2.
- $S_1 \subset S_2 \iff f(S_1) \supset f(S_2)$
    - This function f has the property of inverting the inclusion relation, but Mr. P and Mr. Q are unaware of the function's existence.
    - So we call both S and f(S) by the same term, resulting in a disagreement about the inclusion relation

Another case where the inclusion relation of sets is reversed
    - [[A wraps around B.]]
    - [[I know both, but the other person only knows one.]]

- [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]]

concrete example
- "General Knowledge" and "Special Knowledge."
    - I would think "general" would be broad and almost encompass "special."
    - Because sometimes "general" is a generalization of "special" that broadens the scope of its coverage.

[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/共変性と反変性_(Computer](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/共変性と反変性_(Computer) Science)
- If A is a superclass of B, then A encompasses B
    - You may assign B to A, but you may not assign A to B.
    - On the other hand, a "function that takes A as an argument" should not be assigned to a "function that takes B as an argument".
        - Substituting "a function that takes animals in general as arguments" for "a function that takes only cats as arguments" is unsafe, because it might be called with a dog as an argument.
        - So the inclusion relation of the set is inverted.
        - This is called [[anti-transformation]].
