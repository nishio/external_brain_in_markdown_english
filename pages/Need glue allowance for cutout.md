- B: [Duplicate and cut out only the parts that seem to break the context.
        - [[May be duplicated]]

- The current Scrapbox cutout mechanism is style A
- But wouldn't it be better to have a [[summary]] of "[[The flow of events leading up to the topic]] (blue)" (margin for pasting together (e.g. two pieces of paper)) at the beginning of the new page? I think it would be better to have it at the beginning of the new page.
    - Related: I've been thinking about [[A better cutout]] lately.
- Otherwise, when you look at a new page, you'll be perplexed because you won't know why we're talking about it.
- I saw [One well is not enough time or attention.
    - It's a cutout of my own diary remarks.
    - The person who wrote it didn't know what he was talking about.
    - Two lines were added at the beginning of the article.
- Oh, that's a good word. That's the way to cut it out.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>

- I'm also inclined to want the cut out page to contain a different point of view than the original context.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Does knowing [[original context]] not prevent you from writing it?
    - It's hard to develop new ones when you're too tied to the original context.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - I guess the most bound state is "placed in its original context without cutting it out".
        - and the default cutout minimizes context.
            - They feel this "destroys the context" and resist cutting it out.
        - I think "Norishiro" is a way to get between the two.

- [[Cutting out the page breaks up the context of the statement.]]

It's interesting that you need a "glue space" when you're doing a "cut-out".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/issac/icon' alt='/villagepump/issac.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Need glue allowance even though it's a cutout

    - As is.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yuyasurarin/icon' alt='/villagepump/yuyasurarin.icon' height="19.5"/>
After cutting out the "[[Step difference elimination]] 」や「 [[burr (e.g. on a machined edge)]] 」みたいなイメージを持った<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/hatori/icon' alt='/villagepump/hatori.icon' height="19.5"/>
- If we follow this image, it would be more like installing "[[slope]]" or "[sanding (e.g. on a filet)" rather than creating a glue line.
