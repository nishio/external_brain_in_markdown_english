    - [[Knowledge must be validated by practice]]
    - [[Ideas are hypotheses and must be tested by implementation]]
- [[Ideas that are not validated by action have no value.]]

- I don't use [[experiment]] and [[practice]] very differently.
    - Similar genres to [mounting
    - [[action]] seems a little more abstract.
    - Some of the behaviors don't make sense experimentally.
        - I don't expect [[unknown experiences]] when I take a bath every night.
        - May try new bath salts, this is an experiment
            - [[uncertainty]] is the difference between having
- Between [[Verified by experiment]] and [[Verified by practice]], I would venture to say that "Verified by experiment" has a higher degree of nuance in terms of the objective of verification itself.
- I wonder if I'll ever require the reader to capture that [[nuance]].
- I wrote that I "don't use [[much distinction between]] experiment and practice," and after a while the thought emerged as "[[I dare say there is]] a little difference, not equal."
    - from  [[prediction model]]
        - > Whether this specific prediction is correct or not is [* verified by experimentation
        - > When it is predicted that some action will yield a beneficial result, it is practiced (here), and if the prediction is correct, a beneficial result is yielded and gained, and if the prediction is not, an opportunity to improve the prediction model is yielded and gained.
        - When I wrote up to (here), I was aware that I had chosen "practice" when I wrote up to

- Similar genres to [[social implementation]] and [user test
