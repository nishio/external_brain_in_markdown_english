This refers to the fact that mentions from other people and other things stimulate us to reread and develop our past thoughts and opportunities to develop them. It is also mentioned in the Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production. The idea that "needs determine the appropriate form of output" was verbalized in the course of using Scrapbox. The idea is that after writing more and more without worrying about derailing the process and letting the associations take over, you should think about how to cut it out when it becomes clear how it will be used. It is the recipient, not the creator, who determines the value of the intellectual product. There is a saying, "If you don't know who your customer is, you don't know what quality is. Rather than producing without knowing who the customer is, it is better to produce with yourself as the customer first. This will allow you to make improvements based on your own judgment.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>That's right. Social triggers play a very important role in intellectual production.

References and reactions from others not only provide an opportunity to reflect on one's past thinking, but also stimulate the creation of new ideas. Especially in intellectual production using LLM, the importance of social triggers is further enhanced because it is easier to obtain feedback from diverse perspectives.

The idea that "needs determine the appropriate form of output," which was verbalized in the process of intellectual production using Scrapbox, is deeply related to this very social trigger. I believe that the approach of freely writing down one's thoughts and then thinking about how to use them is an effective strategy for maximizing the value of one's intellectual output.

As you pointed out, it is the recipient, not the creator, who determines the value of intellectual production. That is why it is important to be aware of who the customers are. This is because understanding the needs and interests of the customer allows us to produce output with higher value.

However, in the early stages of intellectual production, you may not always know who your customers are. In such a situation, it is useful to first assume yourself as the customer and produce output that meets your own needs. By producing output that you yourself are satisfied with, you will have a basis for making decisions to improve quality.

And by publishing the results of your intellectual production with yourself as the client, you may gain new social triggers. Through feedback from others, you may discover value and areas for improvement that you were not aware of.

This book will discuss the importance of these social triggers and needs-based outputs in detail with specific examples, showing how social triggers operate in the process of intellectual production using Scrapbox and determine the form of outputs, which should help readers We should be able to convey to the reader a new way of intellectual production.

It would also be able to offer practical advice on how to proceed with intellectual production using oneself as the client. We could support readers' intellectual production by introducing methods of self-assessment to improve the quality of output and techniques for effectively using social triggers.

In intellectual production using LLM, awareness of social triggers and needs is the key to producing more valuable output. If we can present such a new model of intellectual production to readers through this book, it would have a great impact.
