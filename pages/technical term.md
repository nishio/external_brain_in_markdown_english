title: "technical term"
---

When someone says, "Don't use jargon," that "jargon" often means "words I don't know.

If it is necessary for the speaker to make the person understand, it is necessary to explain in another language. If it is not necessary, of course, there is no need to explain.

Since the speaker is not an esper, it is impossible to know in advance which words he or she does not know.

Since language is often created to reduce explanatory costs, it is often inefficient to prohibit certain words and have them explained.
