Thinking At the Edge (TAE) is a methodology to make linguistic things that I still can not express well, but I feel important. It is an interesting feature of TAE to promote verbalization focusing on discomfort.

TAE is a complex methodology consisting of 14 steps, so I will not explain it in detail here.
Eugene T. Gendlin, the philosopher who developed this methodology, calls it "felt sense," which is "something that we haven't yet been able to articulate well, but that we feel is important.
It is useful to give this concept a name, because we can use it as handle to point it.
So I will adopt the word "felt sence" in this book as well.

In order to express felt sense, TAE writes out words that come up, trying to make short sentences using that word, and gradually progressing the languageization. Short sentences can not accurately represent felt sense from the beginning. However, if you write it down and compare it with felt sense, the discomfort will become clearer.
