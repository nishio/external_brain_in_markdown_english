title: "Improving efficiency in areas that are not bottlenecks will not improve overall efficiency."

> [shibu_jp](https://twitter.com/shibu_jp/status/873840089008267265) I thought during the [[business book boom]], when you [[shorten the time]], like installing fully automatic machines in your household, or taxiing your commute, you can make money from that. Unless you have a job or something, you're just spending. To use a Mario analogy, it's like you've spent your stars in a place where there are no enemies.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/873901002696531968) [[TOC]] In [[TOC]] terms, you are [[making efficient]] where you are not [[bottleneck]] and [[overall efficiency]] is not increasing.

If there is a [[measurable]] value that is easy to understand, people will use it as a [[KPI]].
    - [[Incorrect KPI setting]]

The [[utilization rate]] of [[processing machine]] in TOC is one of them.
- Seemingly "more is better" but can be counterproductive when viewed as a whole system

- [[lack of vision]]
