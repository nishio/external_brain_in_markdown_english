Personal Timeline

When you need random stimulation to take a break.
- You should get some sleep.
- We don't need Twitter, we need a timeline that randomly shows articles we want to read but haven't, or long articles, or friends' Scrapboxes, etc.
- Same as [boiled frog
    - The gradual decline in quality makes us accustomed to it.
- When you put in a large piece of content, such as a book, you should be able to chop it into chunks of reasonable length
    - And we can use LLM to extract "chunks of meaning" from it.
        - Let's call this a tweet.
    - Put it in the DB and display it randomly.
        - You can like, bookmark and mute.
            - The difference between likes and bookmarks is currently unclear. In the past on Twitter, "likes" were public and "bookmarks" were private?
        - When you click on a tweet that interests you, the results of a vector search on that content are displayed as "related tweets".
- I'm currently putting my Scrapbox into a vector search engine every day for vector searches, so I'm sure I can derive from that.
