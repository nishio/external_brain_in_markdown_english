A discussion of open source and research publication exchange modalities
Summary: The act of an IT engineer or scientist making software or research results available to the public does not fall entirely within the existing exchange modalities A-C, which can be considered a "gift to the public".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

In the first place, the release of research results by a scientist as a paper is also not compatible with A - C. I dare say that both of them are "gifts to the public". Both are, dare I say it, "a gift to the public.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1710634486944374998) It is an exchange style C to consult with companies in the form of a technical advisor, etc., and tell them how much you get paid per month.
>  Then what is open source publishing, writing a technical blog, or registering a paper on a preprint server? If you give a gift to a specific subject first, and that specific subject gives you something back in return, it's a reciprocal exchange style A, but it doesn't seem right.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1710635154992140303) There is an exchange style B-like in that it is offered to a "public", a "greater than human being", but the public is no longer returning shelter.
