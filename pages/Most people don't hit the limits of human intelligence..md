>  Most people don't see it because there aren't many tasks that push the limits of human intelligence
- Oh, I see.
    - This wasn't verbalized in this way.
        - [[o1 Pro consideration 2024-12-08]] later in [[The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.]] and the phrase "pushing the edge" was "pushing the [[edge of human knowledge]]"
        - This is a concept that is highly compatible with [Limits of human intelligence
    - There is a slight difference in meaning between "the stock of verbalized knowledge of the human collective called humanity" and "the feasible tasks of individual human intelligence."
    - Then [[Specialty Bridges]] was talking about [[the realm of human reach]].

> [emollick](https://x.com/emollick/status/1865200244964671776) I don’t think o1 is AGI in any conventional sense to be clear. But I think the fact that most people can’t find a use for it when it is quite good in some hard things is a good indicator.

That's the one.

- Since most people do not deal with tasks that confront their intellectual limitations in their daily lives, it is difficult for them to realize the true value of highly intelligent systems. However, if such systems are widely put to practical use, the task standards of society as a whole may change, and difficult problems that could previously be handled only by specialists may be incorporated into "ordinary tasks. As a result, highly intelligent tools that individuals felt were "unnecessary" may eventually become indispensable in the new standards. In other words, the limits of invisible intelligence may change in the course of social and historical processes, and in retrospect may reach the stage of "becoming aware of the need for it.

- The future of the entire human race doing [[PhD]] work is hot.
- Well, "the entire human race" may be an exaggeration, but an increase in the percentage of the human race of people doing PhD work could happen.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Summary: It is estimated that less than 1% of the entire world population has a Ph.
        - Description: Although it varies by country, region, and field of study, it is generally estimated that only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the total population holds a Ph. In the United States, for example, less than 2% of the population holds a doctorate, and the figure is even lower on a global scale.
- Four years for an undergraduate, two years for a master's, and three years for a doctorate, which is high cost and relatively unattractive as a profession, so few people choose it.
    - Once AI destroys the white collar to the point that the bachelor's and master's degrees are all but worthless, will the relative attractiveness of the PhD increase?
    - Engineering PhDs often involve real-world experimentation
