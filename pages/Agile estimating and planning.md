            - Do high-risk, high-value tasks first.

- You're talking about cost-effectiveness, net present value, internal rate of return, etc., but you can't estimate enough to make that argument in many cases.

    - [[Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction]]

    - Do not divide the story into tasks
    - The source of this term seems to be "master programmer."
    - Don't separate "implement the UI" from "implement the middle tier."
    - Implement across all, even partially, rather than completing only one specific logic layer
    - why?
        - If you divide the iterations in such a way that nothing can be learned until both iterations are completed, such as "one iteration on the server and one iteration on the client," you are ruining the "fast run/learn cycle" by dividing the iterations. Instead, create a minimum implementation that allows both the server and client to be used and tested. Tracer (Towhead).

- Parkinson's Law The amount of work expands until all the time given for completion is met
- Schedule delays are transmitted ahead of time.
- Clark and Wheelwright's experiment with multitasking More than three tasks at the same time reduces productivity.
