- Some people think [[change]] is [[disadvantageous]].
- When the whole world is changing, [[staying the same]] comes at an additional cost
    - The whole world is always changing in the first place.
        - As the rate of change in the world accelerates, the cost of staying the same increases
            - Those who prefer no change will "pay more for doing nothing."


- To float a boat on the river and stop to avoid being swept away...
    - I thought, "Let's drop the anchor," but then the conversation got confusing.
- Airplanes need fuel to stay airborne.


- [[Red Queen hypothesis (of evolutionary biology)]]
- [[You have to keep running if you want to stay.]]
        - [[To stay on the shoulders of giants, we must keep running.]]
