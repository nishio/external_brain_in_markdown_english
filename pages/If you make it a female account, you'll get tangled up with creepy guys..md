I hope you will read it. You should read it.

    - > It occurred to me that I could pretend to be a woman for a week on Mobage...
    - > I received an astonishing number of messages one after another from men in and outside of the prefecture whom I did not know. I received an astonishing number of messages from men who seemed to be my age and adults in their 20s and 30s (I learned at that time that adults also play Mobage), asking me to tell them my e-mail address because they wanted to be my friend, to meet up, to go out, and so on. Some of the messages were "let's have sex" kind of messages.
    - > It was an astonishing week.
    - > I was shocked by all of it: that women were usually subjected to such sickening stares, that men were such sickening beings, and that I, the same man, had no idea how sickening they were.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1897718480612511991) When I was a college student, I once tried to create a female-like subaccount on mixi, but it was really the same as this article [[creepy guys flocked to it]], so I think it's a good idea for men who have never tried it before to give it a try. I think it's a good idea for men who have never tried it before to give it a try. I don't know if it still reproduces the same thing now that there are more and more feminine accounts on the Internet.


> [n2pURz6ryn5d0nz](https://x.com/n2pURz6ryn5d0nz/status/1897572918005268604) A bartender I'm good friends with said that he went to 2-chome to train himself to recognize a look that women don't like and how much he I'm not sure how much I hate to be looked at sexually.

> [chrysostomus__](https://x.com/chrysostomus__/status/1897584838552817767) My first name is "I", but some guys think I'm a woman and come at me with that, and when they find out I'm a man, they throw out a few expletives. I'm a man, and when he finds out that I'm a man, he'll throw out a few expletives, but he often retracts his [[aggressiveness]].
>  I don't know what that means at all, and I'm classifying you as an anomaly, but then there are so many of you.
>  I'm a genuine netizen, but the exposure of the tweets is amazing!

> [lm_Clare](https://x.com/lm_Clare/status/1897590779788267845) A white male American supervisor distrusted a female subordinate who took the time to respond to his inquiries, so he used her name to respond to an email inquiry.
>  Then, I saw a story on YouTube about a customer who was surprised at the unimaginable way he was treated: relentlessly involved, superior, sexually harassing emails.
>  This is it.

> [hinaxichigo](https://x.com/hinaxichigo/status/1897614579171283093) There was a man last year who did the same demonstration on Twitter.
>  That person also expressed disgust that just being a woman made such a difference.
>
>  Why don't the men who argue against it actually try it themselves?

> [frompoison](https://x.com/frompoison/status/1897610091194696066) I laughed when the comment section was split, as expected, between real women who agree with you and men who get off on calling you a man.

> [____390____](https://x.com/____390____/status/1897684742151295450) The original article was excellent.

>  I read the rebuttal article posted in the comments section, and I realized that men don't even know if "decent men" from a man's point of view are really decent or not. I don't know if men can even tell whether "decent men" are really decent or not.

> [wotamucco](https://x.com/wotamucco/status/1897718553199231268) The author was a man who could see the "creepiness" in the kind of nudges from people he didn't like that he didn't even consider a favor, and he understood the feelings of women, I was wondering what the difference is between the two when I read in the comment section of the note, "I once pretended to be a woman, but I really thought it was easy to be a woman. I wondered what the difference was.

> [BeeChiha](https://x.com/BeeChiha/status/1897559057902576100) Kim Tak has learned firsthand about the perpetrating nature of men. I wish he would speak up more.
