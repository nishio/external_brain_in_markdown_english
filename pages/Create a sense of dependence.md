title: "Create a sense of dependence"
---

A rather gruesome article.
"[[Don't fulfill other people's wishes.]]"
Because those whose [[aspiration]] is satisfied will temporarily [[gratitude]] but will throw you in the waste basket like an orange that has been eaten. [Hope is good, gratitude is bad. You should not be gratified by fulfilling hope, but by partial fulfillment [[dependence]].

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Create a sense of dependence
v
He who adores, not he who adorns, becomes a god. The wise man would rather see people need him than be grateful to him. Keeping them at the doorway of hope is diplomatic and their [Trusting in gratitude is a wild thing. Hope has good memories; gratitude has bad memories. More is gained from dependence than courtesy. He who has satisfied his thirst turns his back on the well, and the orange once smoked falls from the golden plate into the waste basket. When dependence ceases, good behavior ceases as well as respect. Let one of the chief lessons of experience be to keep yourself always in need, even of a patron on the throne, without fully satisfying your hopes. But lest you go wrong, let silence not be excessive, and let not the failure of others be incurable for your own good.
