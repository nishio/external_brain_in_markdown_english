title: "Questions cause a flow state."
---

- Today I have another step forward in understanding the concept that "[[question]] encourages [[verbalizing]].
- Questions encourage verbalization, but "answering questions correctly" is not a prerequisite for doing so.
- Any question of [[moderate difficulty]] that is not so difficult that it cannot be answered, nor so easy that it can be answered immediately without thinking.
- It is more important to get into the [[flow state]] by considering problems of moderate difficulty.

- But you never know what questions will be of moderate difficulty for them.
    - Sometimes the other person thinks too hard.
        - You could answer more casually, but you try to remember everything you've said in the past to maintain consistency.
    - On the other hand, you think too easily.
        - They oversimplify and think, "This is the only possible answer to that question, right?

- What should we do in such a situation?
    - There is no way to deal with it in advance.
    - I have to take it as, "You think so."
