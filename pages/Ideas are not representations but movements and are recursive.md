Ideas are not representations but movements and are recursive
The expression "ideas are not representations but movements and are recursive" is a concept used to describe the nature of ideas and their generative process, especially in philosophical and aesthetic contexts. We interpret this phrase by breaking it down into the following elements

1. what does "ideas are not representations" mean?
Representation refers to the depiction of one thing as something else, i.e., a static image that "represents something as it is.
This assertion suggests the idea that ideas are not the reproduction of a fixed image or object, but something more dynamic and emergent.
Example: The

Whereas the classic "apple idea" is represented as a picture or symbol of a stationary apple, the emphasis here is on the growth and change of the apple, and even the movement itself as it relates to other ideas.
2. what does "an idea is a movement" mean?
Movement" here refers not only to physical movement, but also to the process of change and generation itself.
An idea is not just a static concept, but a process of building and unfolding relationships between different elements to create new meaning.
Philosophical Perspectives:.

- [[Gilles Deleuze.]] states that "[[an]] idea is a process of generation (becomings), not a fixed form." Based on this, ideas are interpreted as consisting of dialogue, contradiction, and change.
3. what is "recursive"?
Recursivity refers to the property of an idea to have a self-referential structure and to change and evolve while returning to itself.
Recursive ideas grow by being generated once and then interacting with other elements and situations, the results of which again feed back into the idea itself.
Example: The

The process by which a scientific hypothesis (idea) is modified by experimental results, and those modifications again influence the hypothesis.
The process by which the ideas of a work of art are reinterpreted and their meaning evolves in response to viewers' reactions and changes in the historical context.
4. the big picture: representation vs. movement
Representation is the classical viewpoint that understands ideas as fixed, static forms.
Movement and recursion are contemporary perspectives that view ideas as an ever-evolving process.
In this way, ideas are not reduced to mere symbols or images, but are understood as "generative fields" that themselves constantly generate new meanings and values.

summary
Ideas are not representations but movements and are recursive," is a perspective that sees ideas not as fixed concepts but as processes that are constantly changing and redefining themselves. This is an important concept in philosophy, science, and art that explains creativity and innovation.
