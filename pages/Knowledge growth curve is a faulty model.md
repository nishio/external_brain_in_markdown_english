title: "Knowledge growth curve is a faulty model"
---

    - [[Knowledge Growth Curve]]
    - It is not clear what exactly the vertical axis is.
- I'm beginning to think it's a false mental model.
- This kind of thinking makes the implicit assumption that "knowledge" corresponds to a one-dimensional value.
    - There is an implicit assumption as if only "knowledge in a particular field" can be isolated and measured in one dimensional values.
- The value of knowledge is not determined by knowledge alone.
        - [[Value is determined by the receiver, not the sender.]]
- Obviously, there's something wrong when you think of the vertical axis as value.
- What exactly is the vertical axis?

- [[Principle that the learning curve is an S-curve]]?
