## Murder Mystery Game
- In the [[Murder Mysteries]] game, each participant is assigned a different character and given a background, secret, and purpose for that character. The objective of the game is generally to find the culprit and get to the bottom of the case. In the process, players must observe the words and actions of other participants to detect hidden agendas and lies.

## On a False Belief Assignment
.
- The [[false belief issue]] is a psychological experiment that measures one's ability to predict the behavior of others even when their beliefs and perspectives differ from one's own. This task is used primarily to investigate cognitive development in children. A famous example is the "[[Sally-Anne task]]. In this experiment, a character hides an object in one location, and the object is moved to another location while the character is gone. By asking the child where to look for the object when the character returns, we test whether the child can understand the false beliefs of others.
