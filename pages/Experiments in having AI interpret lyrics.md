On 9/5 [[the ones who don't have dreams are the ones who come to me, drunk on reality and with a smug look on their face]] were deployed to AI
- --- [[Reflection]]

9/11
- The link here "[[Give a reason not Just be conscious]]" reminded me of a lot of things.
    - I thought it was interesting and did some of them.
    - YouTube now suggests [[MEGUMI]].

9/16
- I heard the phrase [After walking so crazy, so hard, so empty, a clear road map will appear in your heart alone.
        - [[Collect lyrics about life and pick out your favorite phrases.]]

- [[Song lyrics are oracle-like in nature because they are essentially poetry.]]
