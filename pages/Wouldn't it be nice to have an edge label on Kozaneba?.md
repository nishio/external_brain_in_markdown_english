Currently Kozaneba has no labels on the edges.
I don't think it's that hard to put it on.
I want AI to do it.

I don't see an event lisna on the edge... This is tricky.

I can put out edge labels as a view,
I can import a graph with edge labels.
No action targeting edges in the normal UI is possible, so no labels can be added...

Edge labels could be produced by Kozaneba, but it is annoying to be asked in a dialog box every time a line is drawn, so it was not adopted.


They just want to make labels on the lines, and they only get one feedback.
A: Add a label field to the line data structure
B: Add display when labels are present to the view
C: Added dialog for entering label information when creating a line
It's great that they do all of the (Devin.ai)

And C was not good, so I just want to throw away C.
