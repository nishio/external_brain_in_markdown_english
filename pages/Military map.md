title: "Military map"
---

- Metaphor for [Map
For many modern people, when they look at a map, they implicitly think of the entity moving on that map as one
Like when I travel.

When the military commands an army, multiple units move over the map.

If you personally move through a known but unknown world "[[tourist attraction]]" that you don't know, you can acquire an existing map and see the landmarks.
When we see a world that no one else knows, we must not only move and see it for ourselves, but we must also update our maps to reflect the movement of our surroundings and distorted information from outside ourselves.
Nobody has the right map.
Something you draw and make yourself.
