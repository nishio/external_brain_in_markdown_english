title: "blind spot card"
---

The idea is to create a typology of the process by which a human being notices a [[blind spot]] and resolves it, so that when he/she is troubled, he/she can draw a card to solve the problem. This is a more abstract version of TRIZ, which was created by typifying physical patent documents.

We are aiming for a reasonable number of physical cards or pictured mugs in the end, but right now we are in the process of structuring it bottom-up (SEE [[Top-down and bottom-up]]) and are gradually structuring it by collecting examples where we have noticed blind spots or changed our perspective.

- [[Blind Card Candidate]]
- [[Blind spot card with no picture yet]]

- 2025-01-29
    - 46:  [[High probability of failure, but average good]]
    - 47:  [[When more variability is better]]
- 2024-06-13
    - 45:  [[Assumption that it is a circle]]
- 2024-05-13
    - 42:  [[Even if the quantity doesn't decrease, the percentage will.]]
    - 43:  [[Two non-orthogonal axes]]
    - 44:  [[Fill the lake with a glass of water.]]
- 2023-09-04
    - 40:  [[Interaction Attributes]]
    - 41:  [[Splitting up conflicts.]]
- 2023-07-28
    - 38:  [[Assumption that the top is single]]
    - 39:  [[barbell]]
        - I had written on 4/13 but didn't make it a blind spot card.
- 2022-11-24
    - 37:  [[There is not always one solution.]]
- 2022-05-25
    - 36:  [[Only large stones emerge from the water.]]
- 2022-02-16
    - The last update on 2021-10-22 was an attempt to make a [[tote bag]].
        - In the process, [[A series of pictures of two people saying different things]] was created.
            - More and more have been added since then.
            - [[Whether to add a series of pictures of two people saying different things to the blind spot card?]]
            - I won't add all of them, I wrote them on the candidate blind spot card.
    - I was trying to make a new addition to [[Blind Card Candidate]] this time and saw this page and added
        - The blind spot card candidate page is [[dull and uninteresting]], not good.
            - It's just a list of links.
            - What's not good.
                - The link alone is not enough information.
                    - Is that the same for other blind spot cards?
            - Why "candidate" in the first place?
                - Because I'm anxious to shake the sequential number ID.
                - But it's unclear whether everything that's been sequentially numbered in the past is "of a quality that's up to par."
                        - [[(6.3.1.1) If you don't know who your customers are, you don't know what quality is]]
                        - Once you have a clear idea of the specific purpose, such as "to make a tote bag," you can then sift through the criteria for usefulness.
                                - [[Sift through after the use is clear.]]
                        - Undecided whether these blind spot cards will be randomly drawn cards as originally planned, or whether they will be readable, tote bags or mugs.
                - Then we can look at the candidates and add them if there's no reason not to.
            - Why did you assign sequential numbers in the first place?
                - Because we weren't using Scrapbox when this project started.
                    - He felt the name of the card could change.
                        - Referencing by name breaks the link when the name is changed.
                        - So I tried to refer to it by number.
                    - Tried to create a [[network structure]] of knowledge at a time when Scrapbox was not yet in use.
                        - This is strongly reflected in the fact that the first blind spot card is [[Tree and Rhizome]].
                            - [Not a tree of knowledge, but a rhizome of knowledge
                - Can we use Scrapbox now?
                    - In the process of translating the Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production into English, I assigned unique numbers to the headings.
                        - Because there are different pages in different languages that point to the same thing
                        - Blind spot cards don't create value only in Japan either, so there's a chance they'll be translated into English in the future.
                        - Let's keep the numbers.
            - Look at the candidates and add them if there is no reason not to "Then let's process them in order from the top of the candidate blind spot cards," I thought and looked at the first one, and it said, "This should be split into several.
                - It's a tasteless list, I didn't notice.
                - I've split it up and painted a picture, I'll give you some time to make an adoption decision.
        - I'm still having trouble rereading "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures."
            - I thought it was "the manuscript of the blind spot card that had no picture at the time it was transcribed to Scrapbox," to be exact.
    - 31:  [[Both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible.]]
    - 32:  [[familial resemblance]]
    - 33:  [[Two non-orthogonal axes]]
    - 34:  [[There are multiple ways to compromise.]]
    - 35:   [[Move the good stuff.]]
- 2021-10-22
    - 23  [[A set, not an element]]
    - 24  [[Axis, not set]]
    - Cards that have been treated as blind cards for some time OR that were on the list of candidates but not numbered.
        - 25:  [[There is more than one conflict.]]
        - 26:  [[The bias of easy drawing]]
        - 27:  [[The fastest course is not the fastest]]
        - 28:  [[Not one way, but both ways.]]
        - Considerations:.
            - Even if you write "`[blind spot card] candidate`" on the side of the individual page, the link here is too big to be buried.
            - The trigger for consideration isn't pulled when you think, "I'll consider it later before I put it in."
                - [[Blind Card Candidate]]
    - 29:  [[Observation coverage issues]]
    - 30:  [[False dichotomy]]
- 2021-06-28
    - It's been a while since I looked at this one and said, "Where are the 1's and 2's?" I'm like, "Where are 1 and 2?

        - 1  [[Tree and Rhizome]]
        - 2  [[Top-down and bottom-up]]
    - I wonder if there should be a page called "List of Blind Spot Cards."
        - 2022-02-16 I think this page is it.
            - And it appears with a picture on the Related Pages section below.
            - A listing page with just a list of lists is [[dull and uninteresting page]].
- Added on 2019-02-07 22 [[Effectiveness]].
