- What, where are you going to DEPLOY?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/devin/icon' alt='devin.icon' height="19.5"/>Deploy to Vercel, where Devin can develop and deploy full-stack web applications under the devinapps.com domain. After deployment, we will provide you with a public URL. Can you approve it?
- I'll build my own Project in the future, but I guess I'll try it out first.
- We understand! We will start deploying to Vercel. After deployment is complete, we will provide you with the public URL.
- Can I keep using this Vercel project? Or just this session?
- This deployment of devinapps.com is persistent. You can continue to use it after your session ends. You can use the same code base when migrating to your own Vercel project in the future.

Wow.
