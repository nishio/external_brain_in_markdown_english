Day 1 [[STEPN Play Diary 2022-09-25]].
2nd day
3 Energy accumulated, so it increases at 10:00.
Will it create an incentive to say, "I'm going to overflow if I work until the evening before work, so I'll exercise a little before work or during my lunch break?"

I got about 17, durability is down 8, need 3.3 to repair.

Yes, we have to think carefully and decide what to use as KPI when we have numerical indicators.
I think this is the KPI, not GST.

Well, moves and exercises will be on the rise sooner rather than later. I guess the long term goal is to increase cardiopulmonary function...

Light exercise before breakfast.

Whoa, now I can do mint.
![image](https://gyazo.com/e41dd25fdce399e64244bb3f2bea09d2/thumb/1000)
But the ones I can mint now are the more expensive ones, so I'll see you later.

Sold my runner and bought a mint 0 jogger.

Whoa? What's that mystery box you're picking up?

10 Energy consumed, so Invite rights were created.

I won't do it, but I'll check the mint screen.

- Need GMT to level up!

I did eKYC for BINANCE.

    - I thought I was buying GMT at [[BINANCE]], but I was wrong. w
    - You can trade in-game.
- > If you wish to purchase a GMT Token that is not currently listed on Binance, you can follow the step-by-step guide below.
    - [https://www.binance.com/ja/how-to-buy/gomining-token](https://www.binance.com/ja/how-to-buy/gomining-token)

You need 10 GMT to level up, 0.4 for 10, so you need 250.
- Ah, but it's a realistic line if you're walking it daily.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/f100869bbcff83cd6bb12a18f2586be0/thumb/1000)
- I'll send 25 GST, Fee is 2 GST.
    - I got 23 in the wallet.
        - 27We should have sent the money to the bank.
    - Convert to GMT
        - They say I need a token account.
            - I need SOL as Gas to create an account w
            - I wish you'd write down how much you need.
            - I have 0.49, I'll send you 0.25.
            - Is Fee still 2 GST in this case?
![image](https://gyazo.com/522fb69871f942c3ca85d397a12e5c7d/thumb/1000)

It's going to take a while to finalize the trade.
Ah, it's done.

    - Why USDC is boiling over is a mystery.
Now you can put the GMT back on.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b5021118c9f724137c629729e8321837/thumb/1000)
- It took a minute or two for the money transfer to be reflected on the screen after it was successful.
    - I'm in a hurry because I thought it was gone.

- Level up to level 5 could begin.

2022/9/29
I have to go to the office today, so let's see how many GST it costs to get to the station.
- It was 1.8 Energy.

1 Ether is $1349, 1 Solana is $34, 1 Solana is 1000 GST, so 1 GST is about $5, 1 Solana is 50 GMT, so about 2 to 30 GST, or about 1 to 200 yen.
That means I put in 10 GMT to get to level 5, which is about $1-2,000. That's quite an expensive game.

2022/9/30
Walking in the morning because it overflows if not used by 10:00 a.m.
![image](https://gyazo.com/ed542e41df014902c2c838e323ee03c2/thumb/1000)

Looks like Saturday and Sunday will be sunny.
- Add 0.1 Ether
- Oh, I'm missing a few subtleties, I'll just use 0.2 Ether because it's too much trouble.
    - Approx. 40,000 yen
- Now you can buy 4 pairs of sneakers and your energy limit will be 9 (45 minutes).
- I really thought it was going to be 9 feet at Mint during the weekday, but it didn't happen.
    - I sold the runner and the liquidity is not that low, so I think I can sell the surplus after it increases with Mint and not lose too much money.
- Five solanas would be enough to buy four pairs, leaving the rest in the wallet.
- Buy 4 pairs and pay 4.89 solana

I'm wearing a pair of sneakers I bought at random right now, but I'll mint them and grow to like them from the growing number of sneakers I have.

Observe mint costs

- I have 2.3 SOLs on hand now, and if I change all of them to GMT, I'll still have about 70.
    - I can mint it once, but I'd sell it for 1.3 SOL and lose money.
    - Well, if it were that easy to make money, everyone would do it.

You're just decreasing.

![image](https://gyazo.com/a71d85d32f49b39ef9e133eacb516d06/thumb/1000)

This would hit the coin limit, not energy.
![image](https://gyazo.com/b153befed806f4f3ea13934fb197f152/thumb/1000)
I see.

![image](https://gyazo.com/13dcbc9dedd1308404d21684de174b3c/thumb/1000)
I changed everything to GMT and made a deposit.
Let's level up this evening and do our first mint tomorrow.

Ah, well, I'm missing a GST.
- We could solve this by charging for it, but the idea of "walk for a week and you'll be able to mint next Sunday" would be a better incentive to walk on this one.

2022/10/5
- I've been in the habit of "walking about 45 minutes every day and getting 50 GST" for a while now.
- To explain in a few words what STEPN is at present, it is "an application to create an exercise habit by paying 30,000 yen in advance and getting 250 yen for a 45-minute walk every day.
    - That's where the value is for me.
- Today is the first rainy day.
    - What will happen?
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/74dc845a7e49db3345a1ecbb10f16926/thumb/1000)
    - Oh, I walked last night, so it's almost full.
    - I'm hoping there's a GPS-accessible course that I can walk on in the rain without getting wet.
        - Well, maybe a shopping street with an arcade...
    - I just wish there was someplace I could walk in the winter where it wasn't so cold.
    - Well, it's not easy.
        - I wondered if I would have to go to the station and take the train, but then I realized that I could walk on the station platform without getting wet.
    - When that happens, there will be a mysterious reversal of the situation: "It's raining today (while going to the station to walk), so I'll go to work.
- I won the alpha tester lottery for [[sleepgochi]].
