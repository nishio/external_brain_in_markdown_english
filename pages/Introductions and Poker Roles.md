title: "Introductions and Poker Roles"

- [[self-introduction]] and [[poker]] roles

- No pair if you only put in cards (achievements) that seem to be strong at random
    - No-pairs win or lose on the strength of their cards, but no-pairs lose to weaker one-pairs.
- Three cards are rather strong.
    - better than two pair
        - [[Make three kinds of works.]]
- There are multiple ways to create a role (between achievements [[how to find a connection]]).
    - Pair: Must be the same number
    - Flash: Must be in the same suit
    - Straight: being in the same flow
    - This is where creativity is tested, not just in a certain way.
        - Three-card by connecting an engineer, an entrepreneur, and a science fiction writer with the interpretation of "a job to create the future".
        - No pair of words of interpretation to connect the same set of achievements.
    - Without five cards, you can't get a flush or a straight in the first place.
        - It's pointless to have four cards.
- Easy point of self-introduction
    - Instead of throwing away cards and replacing them, the cards gradually accumulate.
        - If you take actions that result in cards (achievements) being earned, you will accumulate more and more cards over time and the game will become easier and easier.
- How it differs from poker
    - Winning conditions are different
        - What is a strong card depends on the field.
            - Some communities do not value certain outcomes.
                - Going to the entrepreneurial community and saying "I worked long and hard and got a peer-reviewed paper accepted" doesn't get much sympathy.
                - If you talk in academia like, "I made a sale by creating customer value with a dead technology," they look at you like, "You're doing a crappy job."
                - [[community values]].
                        - [[The idea of wanting to do something new is old.]]
    - Often the goal is not to "win" (= make a stronger role than the opponent) in the first place.
        - There can be disadvantages to creating a strong role.
            - It is disadvantageous to be perceived as strong in the first introduction of a wargame
        - Common Objective Setting
            - stand out and be recognized
            - conspicuously unrecognizable
            - Recognized as a peer
            - Create common ground for subsequent conversations.
    - [[Ginza Madamisukai]] said that you didn't introduce yourself, that you didn't have the right purpose set for your self-introduction in the first place.
