- [[side of well]] is [[community of practice]] or

[/villagepump/well](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/well)

- [[Legitimate Peripheral Participation]] ？
- But the organization's intended operations don't exist.
        - [[Gesellschaft und Gemeinschaft]]
- For example, if there is a place with a clearly defined purpose, such as "This is a place for people unfamiliar with Scrapbox to experience communication through asynchronous collaborative editing in Scrapbox," then it can be called a community of practice that tries to achieve that purpose.
