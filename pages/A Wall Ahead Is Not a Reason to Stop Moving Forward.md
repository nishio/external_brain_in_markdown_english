Story
- As you move forward, you begin to see what's ahead more clearly.
- Suppose you see a wall in your path.
- Even if you can't find a way around the wall at this moment, that's not a reason to stop moving forward.
- This is because moving forward allows you to see what's ahead more clearly.
    - What appears to be an impassable wall from a distance might actually be a crumbling wall that can be avoided with a slight detour.
- If you don't move forward, the wall will remain a wall.

Discussion
- Is it true that "if you don't move forward, the wall will remain a wall"?
    - Not necessarily; even if you just wait, the wall might crumble due to causes other than yourself.
    - From a distance, you can't tell if the wall will crumble soon or if it will remain intact for the foreseeable future.
- Getting closer doesn't always reveal a way around.
    - That's true.
    - If you can think of a more promising path than "moving towards the wall," it's better to take that path.
    - When you can't think of anything, it's better to walk towards the wall than to choose to stay put.
