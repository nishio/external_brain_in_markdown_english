- I'm not sure about "[[atomic]]" ([[atomic]]).
- To be precise, "there is [[uncomfortable feeling]] in the use of that word."
- I think the nuance, the direction is something like this:.
    - A single line of bullets with directives or conjunctions gets in the way of moving them to a free place.
        - So if you intend to move it, you better get rid of those ties.
    - Writing for one-dimensional reading gets in the way of free structure and thinking.
        - So it's better to write in a way that doesn't depend on other fragments, on fragments that can be moved two-dimensionally, to create "parts for thinking in a two-dimensional arrangement".
- If you call something as "small" as this "atomic", it's not strange.
- But I'm uncomfortable with calling a page consisting of multiple sentences, for example, "atomic."
    - Isn't that a crazy high molecular weight compound!" I feel like
    - If you squint and drop the [[Cognitive Resolution]] so much that the page looks like a grain, I can understand a little bit why you want to call it atomic.
    - Okay, so this is the source of the discomfort.
        - In what one person calls "atomic," I see a structure made up of multiple other "things.
        - The word "atom" originally meant "undividable" and was used to refer to the smallest constituent unit of the world
    - The internal structure of the real atom was also discovered after the fact, so is there any problem if the layers are limited?
            - [[Atomicity at the Kozane level]]
            - [[Row-level atomicity]]
            - [[Page-level atomicity]]
    - The abbreviation "atomicity" for page-level atomicity would have clashed with atomicity at other levels and caused discomfort.

- >  [[itemization]].
- > In [[WiKi]], it is difficult to comment on long, beautiful sentences.
- >  Every time I comment on a detail, I need a [[reference]] or directive to point to a specific part of the sentence.
- >  Stories can only be chained in series.
- >  The only people who can cut back would be those who are equally good at writing.
- >  Bullet points make it easy to insert simple comments on an item-by-item basis.
- This could be translated as "[[Row-level atomicity]] is useful
