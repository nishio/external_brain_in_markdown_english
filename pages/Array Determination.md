title: "Array Determination"
---

It is necessary for the book reading experience to establish the order in which the content is read, separated by a certain amount of content. This is called [[making finite]] and [[Array Determination]].

- >  [[book]] creates an array of configurations to convey one large chunk of meaning. It fixes the parts and reduces the degrees of freedom. Because by doing so, the meaning stands up.
- >  Of course, you can create a "book" on Scrapbox. If you [[Separated by a certain amount of content]] and [[Fix the order in which content is read]], the reading experience is no different from that of a book. The point is not the media format, but the presence or absence of [[making finite]] and [[Array Determination]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481860334101348353): I used the term "[[unidimensionalization]]" in the context of "[[Writing is one-dimensional]]" I thought I was copying what Kurashita-san used, but when I searched Scrapbox for "one-dimensional", I got no hits at all. I thought I was copying Mr. Kurashita.

- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481862086276030467): my Scrapbox had the phrase "[[Words serialized in one dimension]]" so I thought, "Well, I originally wrote [[ serialization]]", so I thought "Well, it originally said **serialization**! but it still didn't.

> [Reputeless](https://twitter.com/Reputeless/status/1481862964659777536): writing I found an article that looks like it in the next dimension.
- > [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481864581513617408): I see that "[[making finite]]" is used a lot.

        - > > [[Without finitization, people will be crushed by information pressure.]]

> [rashita2](https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1481867036666269696): I remember writing that somewhere. Also, I had a slightly different expression in "[[Scrapbox Information Organization]]".
- > >Books create an array of configurations, compositions, to convey one big chunk of meaning. It fixes the parts and reduces the degrees of freedom. Because in doing so, the meaning stands up.
- > >Of course, you can also create "books" on Scrapbox. If you divide the content by a certain amount and determine the order in which each piece of content is read, the reading experience is no different from that of a book. The point is not the format of the media, but rather the finitization and the determination of the sequence.

- I want to output [/shokai/brain as it is](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/brain as it is).
- > [shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857625809980280832): I've found [[Gyazz]] so much that the information structure of papers and other ordinary texts/books seems like a wacky thing to me, so I'm not sure if people who are enjoying Scrapbox now will do so in a while. I think it might happen to those who are enjoying Scrapbox now after a while.
- > [shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857626678415155200): The value of the work of transforming a linear structure into a format that is less responsive to people, while taking care not to reduce the amount of information as much as possible, will be lost. It's not worth the effort.
- > [shokai](https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857629679699640321): And look at the people who are serious about doing it in TeX, they are insane!
- > [masui](https://twitter.com/masui/status/859216891750916096): There is no need to "publish" a document as it is now that there is a format that can convey to the reader the net-like consciousness of the author as he/she writes the document. Serializing and printing on a stack of paper is just too wacky. The same goes for "e-books" that imitate it, which have completely stopped thinking.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This is the position that the book reading experience is old-fashioned (wacky) and we don't need to do the work to create it
    - I think this is the difference in stance between transmitting to early adopters or to the majority. see: [[chasm theory]].
