Kazuho and YasunoriGoto1 discuss the usability of open source software and the impact of developer skill level on usability. YasunoriGoto1 pointed out that the high skill level of developers makes it difficult to imagine how difficult it would be for less skilled users.

This discussion also relates to the disagreement between fladdict and mizchi regarding the Mars terminal UI. fladdict pointed out that the Mars terminal UI is a bad pattern because it is a system that only works when mastered by a person. On the other hand, mizchi countered that professionals need professional abstraction and shortcuts, and that terminals and programming editors have similar problems.

Combining kazuho's points with mizchi's rebuttal, the following argument can be developed The difficulty in using open source software stems from the high skill level of developers and lack of investment in user support. Tools for professionals require high levels of abstraction and shortcuts, while ease of learning and usability should be prioritized in software for general users. However, open source software developers tend to assume users with similar skill levels to their own and often do not consider the needs of the average user.

To solve this problem, open source software developers need to understand the needs of general users and invest in usability improvements. At the same time, it is important to distinguish between tools for professionals and software for general users, and adopt UI designs appropriate for each. In this way, usability of open source software should be improved through dialogue between developers and users.


> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1797873605575123254) Talking about CUI editors, I mentioned that vim is out of the question, but nano also has a bad learning curve with its "learn the shortcuts" approach.
>  In the case of GUI, I'm talking about the fact that there is no such lead-in, whereas with GUI, you are supposed to learn shortcuts while affording them in the menu, so it's not good. The one that reveals your age if you say MIFES or VZ here.
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1797878353812492576) If you don't want to use function keys, you can use the Ichitaro ver.3 method where you press escape and select various items from the menu that comes up!
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1797981735537549754) This stuff is also discussed in the famous UI book Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface. It says
>  "Let them choose by looking, not by memory and typing."
>  "Programmers can do command line operations that utilize memory and logic, but the average user is not a programmer."

> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1797895536592474277) "Why is open source software so hard to use?"
>  "That's because user support costs aren't structured to cut into profits."
> [YasunoriGoto1](https://x.com/YasunoriGoto1/status/1797931023810044378) The skill level of the developers themselves is so high that I can't imagine how it would be difficult to use for someone with less skill. I can't imagine how it would be difficult to use for someone with less skill....
>  The name of the game is.
>  "Why don't you just write a script?" I've had the most recent exchange of "Why don't you just write a script?" in my immediate vicinity, but that's raising the bar for users one step higher....
> [kazuho](https://x.com/kazuho/status/1797982150337438094) Here the two topics merge!

> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1797559298744340548) This is a bad pattern for a UI. This is a system that only works when people master it.
>  >tetsudo_yameru: Craftsmanship in the handing of the Mars terminal.
>  The sound of tapping on the display is also pleasant.
> [fladdict](https://x.com/fladdict/status/1797597365203013851) I'm not sure if I'm getting the premise across... but it's no good when a product that isn't a space station or special medical device requires "highly skilled and complex operations" from the workers... It's not a space station or special medical equipment...
>  I think these things need to be used by new employees at top speed in 1-2 weeks.

> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1797958249159053359) If you say this is a bad idea, then terminals and programming editors would be wiped out. I think it just means that professionals need professional abstractions and shortcuts.
> [mizchi](https://x.com/mizchi/status/1797958607256142001) This is also why Scratch is useless for programmer jobs
