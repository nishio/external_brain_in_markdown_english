title: "Texting isn't killing them, people are."
---

- The expression [[dead text]], assuming that the text has the attribute of being "alive" or "dead," but there are times when a text that has been inactive for a long time and you thought it was dead [[sprout]] for some reason. [[Tree metaphor]].

By assuming that something that is not really dead yet is dead, have we not killed it?
