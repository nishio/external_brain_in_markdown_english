Formerly titled: [[Social Triggers]] bring [[dead text]] back to life

> [tkgshn](https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1409159554831581185): (I see Nishio's Scrapbox every day)
> I shared my tweet yesterday about the "systematization of the unknown" in the "Encyclopedia of the Unknown" without linking it to Nishio's past notes (I've been manually creating a lurking bot) [[Hatena2010-06-11]].

- Philosophy not to [Warehouse of dead texts
- But if the dead text is still sedimented with an old update date and time, there's no real harm done.
Get a hit on your search.
    - [[One pocket principle]]

- [[Importing Hatena Diary into Scrapbox]]
- This is an old experiment
- [[Import Hatena Diaries to Scrapbox with past dates]]
- Here is what actually took place in this project

Actual connections between "living topics" and past "dead texts" were discovered.
- What should happen at this time
- It's not good to have pages that don't have a proper title appear in the top updated list.
    - [[If you want to link a line to a long sentence, cut it out on a separate page.]]
- Depends on whether you can give it an appropriate title.
    - If you can attach it, we can make it a living page.

This case had the apt title [[Systematization of the unknown]].
- A search for this keyword yielded two blog posts.
    - [[Hatena2010-04-18]]
    - [[Hatena2010-06-11]]
- I copied the necessary parts and created a new page.

I noticed it later.

> Secure Override Operation

- I originally assumed that this imported stuff would not be edited, I forgot.
- Thanks to the fact that it was a machine-generated "page with no proper title," it avoided editing itself.
- You titled this page "A case study of a socially triggered dead text brought back to life," which is incorrect.
    - I thought the dead text was not brought back to life?
    - The dead text is given a plain title "It is a dead text," thereby preventing direct human editing
        - Scrapbox doesn't have such a feature, but I'd rather it be uneditable.
    - The dead text gave birth to a child.
        - 'dead text' was recognized as a metaphor for [[dead fish]], but mismatch
        - Dead fish don't have babies.
            - Like [[New shoots have sprouted from dead trees]] #dead trees
    - Changed the title to "A Case Study of New Sprouts Growing from a Socially Triggered Dead Text".
- [/rashitamemo/ the writer kills the information once and the reader resurrects it](https://scrapbox.io/rashitamemo/ the writer kills the information once and the reader resurrects it).
    - Books are dead text
    - The seeds in it can take root and sprout in the fields of the reader's heart.
        - Dead texts are not brought back to life.
    - Some people chop up dead texts and put them on a shelf, that's not budging.
