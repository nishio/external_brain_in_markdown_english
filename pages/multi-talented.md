multi-talented
xciii

Many excellent people are equal to many others. By sharing the joys of your life with your circle, you enrich the lives of that circle. Variety of excellence is the joy of life. It is a great art to make use of all that is good, for nature has made man an abstraction of himself in his highest development, just as art, by training his taste and intellect, makes him create in him a true microcosm.
