title: "Tasks are what to do"
---

Tasks are often written in the form of "what to do" (what to do).
Tasks that are written but languish unprocessed often have a high hurdle to start because the "how to do" (how to do) is unclear, or the "why do" (why do) has been forgotten and the energy to execute the task has not been generated.

There's no point in pouring time into something you don't know why you're doing it, so check that first.
- 1: Why do it?
    - If you don't know, move it from the "task list" to the "list of things I once thought I should do but now forget why."
        - If you can simply "delete" it, that's fine, but people tend to hesitate to delete it if they think "if I delete it, I can't get it back".
- 2: How do we do it?
    - If you don't know, do the task of "find out how to do it" first.
    - If you know it, write it down.
        - Viewing what you have written down clarifies the task.
