> Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met with executives from seven [[semiconductor]] companies from the U.S., Europe, South Korea, and [[Taiwan]] at the Prime Minister's official residence on August 18. It is unusual for executives of the world's major semiconductor companies to gather in one place. The importance of securing stable supplies of semiconductors is increasing. They exchanged views on business development in Japan, and the Prime Minister himself called for investment in Japan.
