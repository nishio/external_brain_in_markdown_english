title: "Live warped and happy."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458124300322435077): went to bed at a weird time and woke up at a weird time again...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458129055690072066): missed out on the picmin dailies, but this is the same as the other day, "We don't consider a gain to be a gain." [[We don't consider a loss to be a gain."]] I guess insensitivity is necessary to increase the [[happiness]] level of your life.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458130204774125569): "[[insensitivity]]" is described positively, but this is clearly a cognitive distortion of "overestimating certain kinds of losses." I know, right? Well, it is also a cognitive distortion to think that one person's disappearance out of billions of people does not affect many people, so it makes sense for me to live my life, so I'd rather live happily with distortion.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458134553755721734): "I underestimate certain losses." But thinking about it, I don't think I always underestimate losses, and maybe I "underestimate both losses and gains, both belonging to the past".

relevance
    - [[cognitive distortion]]
