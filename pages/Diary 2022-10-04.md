review system
- They say auto-scrolling is better.
- I was trying to add a change in output destination.
    - but I realized that I would rather just rename the same-day folder at hand at the start of the review.
- I think it would be better to run both img2img and inpaint in the same process.
    - I was considering CONT signals, but I mean more than that.
    - If we start merging those, shouldn't the repository no longer be a fork of the original?
    - It's made from the original repository, but considering inpaint, should I make it diffuser based?
