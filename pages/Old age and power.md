title: "Old age and power"
---

I heard the argument that "[[authority]] is a necessary condition for [problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people's control over the young)," and I said, "If I think about the elderly, I feel that even old age is not a necessary condition. I think that these two are independent from each other.

Old people who are connected to power (sometimes in their spare time) often behave in a harmful manner of the type "they don't have time to listen carefully and impose judgments they made based on fragmented information".
