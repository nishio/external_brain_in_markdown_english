With its unique Blockweave structure and incentive design, Arweave provides scalable archiving while using blockchain, and is used as the foundation by many dApps such as [[Mirror.xyz]] and [[Farcaster]].

Storage fees are paid once with AR tokens at the time of upload, and future storage costs are covered by a network-wide "endowment.

The following is an explanation of what would happen to the network if the Arweave endowment ran out, organized in the order of design philosophy, protocol behavior, assumed scenario, and critical perspectives. To summarize the conclusions first, Arweave is designed in such a way that (1) it is difficult to deplete, (2) even if the balance reaches zero, tokens are reissued in stages to compensate for incentives, and (3) as a last resort, new write costs are automatically raised so that existing data is not immediately lost.
