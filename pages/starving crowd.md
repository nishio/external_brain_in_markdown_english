title: "starving crowd"

The story asks the audience, "What conditions do you think would make a good hamburger shop? The story asks the audience to answer "good meat," "good location," and other provider conveniences, and then cuts back to "no, a hungry crowd would be more successful than any of those.

They want to say that [[Customer Presence]] is important, not product features.

The "hungry crowd" is a well-known anecdote in marketing and business, also described as the "starving crowd. The story illustrates simply that no matter how good a product or strategy is, it will not succeed unless there is a hungry customer (market) that desperately needs it. The story is told through the metaphor of a hamburger store in particular, and teaches that the most important thing in business is a "hungry crowd.

Advocates and Origins - Anecdotes from Gary Halbert's Hamburger Shop
The "hungry crowd" story was pioneered in the 1970s by legendary American copywriter [[Gary Halbert]]. In his seminars and classes, Halbert asked his students the following question.

If you and I were each to open a hamburger store and compete to see who could sell more burgers, what would be the "single requirement" we would want to win?

Participants give a variety of answers, including "highest quality meat," "special buns (bread)," "prime location," and "lowest price.

But Halbert said, "OK, I will give you all the favorable conditions I just mentioned. But I will still beat you all if I get just one condition. When the audience asked, "What is that one condition?" Halbert replies, "The only one.

...it's a hungry crowd!"

In other words, the lesson is that as long as you have a "starving crowd" in front of your store, your business will have an overwhelming advantage over any other conditions. In fact, Halbert answers this question by stating that "the only advantage you want is a hungry crowd," emphasizing that "all other advantages don't mean much without a hungry crowd [[of customers]]." This anecdote, which is also documented in Halbert's newsletter, The Gary Halbert Letter, and in his letters (The Boron Letters), has become widely known in the marketing community.

As you will see when you read it, "It's a hungry crowd!" is not a conclusion, but merely an introduction to most of what follows.
Talk continues about how to make a list of the "hungry crowd."

The following is a summary of the main points of the techniques described in the second half of this section.

Stepwise refinement of list quality
- Purchase of Directory Lists
- buyers want to test the product at random at first, and then buy on a large scale.
- Sellers have an incentive to make the first listing they put out a "good one" rather than a random selection (because if they are successful, they will be bought on a large scale).

Evaluation criteria: novelty, frequency, unit price
Recency: Customers who have recently purchased similar products are more responsive.
Frequency: Customers who purchase multiple times are more willing to purchase.
Unit-of-Sale: Customers who have purchased high value products are considered to be truly valuable customers.
→ Especially "novelty" is most important

Specific steps of the test (2 steps)

Step 1: First, DMs were sent to 5,000 randomly selected respondents.
Step 2:
- → After the initial test, use 50,000 filtered by specific states, etc., to verify actual response rates that are more similar to the entire list.
- → The purpose of this is to avoid excessively good results that only appear in the first test (a situation where only the best names are extracted) and to make sure that the results are stable during the rollout.

The above methods aim to link list testing and subsequent rollout with more consistent results in DM marketing and limit the risk of unexpectedly lowered results.
