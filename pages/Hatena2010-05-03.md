*1272843958*Diary of Day 5 in Singapore
The Singaporean government is smart, but the tourist facilities and airport stores are very dull and the gap between the two is strange. There are very few ethnic products sold at the airport, as they can be bought anywhere in developed countries. I want to buy <a href='http://discover-singapore.net/food/food-in/dessert/kuih.html'>lapis sag</a> or something like that, why is there not a single store? Why are there two stores for developed country brands of chocolates, I ask?

Or, when I called for a cab and was told it would take 10 to 20 minutes, another cab from the same cab company would arrive at the same time I was waiting, or when I didn't know how to cancel the cab and was in a slump. I was so confused because I didn't know how to cancel the taxi. Or the cab driver didn't understand the geography of Sentosa at all.
