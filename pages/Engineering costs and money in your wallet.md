title: "Engineering costs and money in your wallet"
---


[[Engineering resources]] are produced by [[production equipment]] that cannot be distributed separately from [[the brain of the individual engineer]], and ownership belongs to the individual engineer.

Sometimes [[non-engineers]] say things like, "If an engineer did this, wouldn't that be the overall optimization?" or something like that.
- How this looks to an engineer is like "I have a 10,000 yen bill in your wallet, let's all go see a movie together, everyone is happy to see a movie, so it's overall optimal".
- That's not total optimization.
- The reason why such a misunderstanding occurs is because engineers misinterpret their "time" as if it were a free resource!
