> I get bored if the problem is too kind for my ability, and stressed if the problem is too hard. Flow is somewhere in between.
> The story of the elders of a tribe who lived in a rich land and began to search for a new land because they thought that their young people would be ruined if they continued to live like this is the same story as the one told the other day in "[[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]," in which the bias toward use makes exploration impossible, and it is also the same story as the first shift, continuous specialists, talked about in [[work shift]], as well as the first shift talked about in [[work shift]], the continuous expert.

> In fact, I had read this anecdote before, but was not reminded of it yesterday when I was thinking about the "trade-off between use and exploration."

> I thought that for the coupling of two pieces of knowledge to take place in the brain, both pieces of knowledge had to be recorded in the brain, even if they are on long-term memory [if you don't remember, it doesn't matter. The stimulus recalls the long-term memory and brings it back to short-term memory, where [[coupling]] takes place. In doing this "[[recall]]," it is a useful strategy to fast reread a book once you have read it.
