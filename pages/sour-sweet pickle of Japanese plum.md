> Sour plum hot water (Chinese version) (Chinese: suwan mei tan/ㄙㄨㄢ ㄇㄟˊ ㄊㄤ)
>  It is a drink made by straining water or boiled oubai, which is made by smoking and drying green plums, adding licorice, cinnamon, sugar, etc., and chilling it. The original drink was described in the book "Wulin ji ji ji" written in the Song Dynasty before 1290, and the name "Sour plum soup" was established as the official name during the Qing Dynasty. At first, it was drunk only at court, but gradually spread to the masses. It is a traditional Chinese drink to ward off the summer heat.
