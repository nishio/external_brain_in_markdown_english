- How to give [[unexplored junior]] money
- The company will provide financial support for the purchase of goods and services that are useful for the promotion of the project.
    - Not an employment contract; employment contracts with elementary school students are problematic.
    - Some schools prohibit part-time work.
    - Mentors make the decision on whether or not the project is beneficial to the promotion of the project.
        - Not verbalized as a rule.
            - Because the do-or-die decision depends strongly on the content of the project.
                - For example, a project to create a game can buy a competing game and study it.
            - So a mentor who understands the project details will make the decision.
    - It is not a "budget to be digested."
        - The operating entity, General Incorporated Association Unexplored, is not an organization that operates on a single-year budget, so surplus amounts may be carried over.
        - So "[[budget]]" is just "a rough estimate of the amount likely to be spent this year.
            - I've spent more than I budgeted for.
        - I have X extra yen in my budget, so I want to buy Y."
            - Consider how much benefit Y will bring to the project.
            - I would like to donate to the OSS project that has been so good to me."
                - That's good.
                - But it doesn't accelerate the project.
        - I think the mentor should simply ask, "Can you explain why you spent on this in front of your sponsor with your chest out?"
    - Expenditures that generate benefits outside of the project period are also possible.
        - Specific example, "10-year domain name contract."
        - Mentor to decide whether to spend or not.
        - If the service release is done by the results meeting, I think it's usually OK.
            - It is a burden for creators to pay renewal fees every year out of their [[pocket]] money, and the problem of domain expiration and not being able to view the results, or having a pornographic site, is greater than the cost of a 10-year contract.

- [[Information is shared in real time on what is being purchased.]]
