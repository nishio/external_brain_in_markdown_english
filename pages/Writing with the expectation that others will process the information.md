### digest
.
Consider the act of writing with the expectation that others will process information at the well. There is an expectation that others will look at one's thoughts and give cool pointers. There is also the expectation that others will relate one's vague ideas to one's own. This act is like outsourcing information processing, and there is a sense of connecting the brain with others. This can be described as a kind of collective intelligence.

### Relevance
.
In Nishio's research note, "2023-02-14 Organizing the Leading Edge of the Top Page," a connection is found with the act of expecting others to process information at the well. The process of cutting out the text written at the well after it has been heated up is similar to the act of expecting others to process information, using others' perspectives and knowledge to create new information.

### deep thinking
The act of expecting others to process information at the well can be considered a type of collective intelligence. The process of using the perspectives and knowledge of others to generate new information leads to the creation of new knowledge that transcends individual knowledge and perspectives. This leads to the creation of new knowledge that transcends individual knowledge and perspectives.
