title: "Risk of doing nothing"
---

Often "[[risk]]" is not used in the [[decentralization]] sense when people say, "The risk of doing nothing is greater." To be precise, it would be "doing nothing has a negative expected value. But the majority of people in the world don't understand the concept of large and small variances, which is fluffy and accepted.

The act of taking a 500 yen coin out of a wallet and throwing it into a river is very low risk. There is no [[uncertainty]] in the profit/loss. Because it is -500 for sure.
