1.### Limitations of Conventional Education
.
    - The Showa/Heisei style of memorization-centered and knowledge transfer education has not kept pace with the demands of rapidly changing society and technology (e.g., Google and AI evolution).
    - Related: [[Overwhelming lack of awareness among high school teachers of the demand for IT in the corporate world]].
2.### change in required capacity
.
    - Universal and principled skills, such as the ability to think logically, verbalizing one's thoughts, and modelling (e.g. a system, etc.) causal relationships and problems, rather than rote memorization, are emphasized.
        - The value of physical competence (physical education) could also be re-evaluated.

3.### Learning innovation through the use of AI
.
    - AI, such as ChatGPT, makes programming, English learning, and error resolution more efficient. [[individually optimized learning methods]] may become more widespread, diminishing the significance of traditional exam wars and face-to-face classes.
        - There are proposals for online universities and private-sector-led educational platforms, which require a flexible response from the private sector rather than bureaucratic reforms.

4.### Exam Wars and Reevaluation of Academic Credentials
.
    - There is an argument that the value of traditional elite lines such as the University of Tokyo is declining and that excessive exam competition is not necessarily efficient.
        - It was suggested that practical experience, communication, and creativity may shift toward greater emphasis in the coming years.

5.### Dealing with an Uncertain Future
.
    - In order to respond flexibly to future changes, it is important to have a wide range of experience and a risk-taking attitude, rather than being bound by fixed concepts.
        - The role of private sector ingenuity and new educational models (e.g., omni-directional communication through [[broad listening]]) will be highlighted.

Overall, the need to restructure educational content, methods, and evaluation criteria to fit the rapidly changing times and to shift from a fixed academic approach to practical and flexible learning is discussed.
