title: "Surprising."

Older people tend to think they know more about older knowledge than they do.
So when I observe something I don't know, I think, "What, you don't know that?" I honestly think, "I don't know that.
It is better not to say it outright, as it may be taken as an insult and will not bring beneficial results.

So, in case I didn't know the same old knowledge,
Someone younger than me said, "What, you don't even know that?" I thought,
Then I think, "I'd better not say it," and I don't say it.
So from me, "What, you don't know that?" I can't observe what they think.
