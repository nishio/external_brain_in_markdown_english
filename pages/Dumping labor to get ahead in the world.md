Dumping labor to get ahead in the world
> [kumagi](https://x.com/kumagi/status/1906291348136976654) "Covering up the lack of ability with time" - this is too much for me too. In other words, I am reminded of the fact that I have been [[dumping]] [[dumping]] [[labor]] in the world.
>  >kyuridenamida: I understand too much, though on a different scale. I can't do it on weekdays except for the time I spend at the daycare center, and I'm talking about me personally, but I've lost the skin of my way of covering my lack of ability with time. x.com/hamko_intel/st...
