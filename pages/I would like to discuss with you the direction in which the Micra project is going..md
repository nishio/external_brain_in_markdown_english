<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to discuss with you the direction in which the Micra project is going.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "micro project" is this "micro project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Experiment to set up a micro server in the company and create a virtual office
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "micro server" is this "micro server"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>A place where employees can enter and tinker at any time.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "employee" is this "employee"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Members who belong to the same company but have less chance to get together physically due to remote work or are geographically distant from each other.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "remote work" is this "remote work"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Do not assemble in a specific place when doing work.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "specific" is this "specific"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>An office or whatever they call it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "office" is this "office"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you're working alone, it's important not to be uncomfortable, but it's a little different if there are lots of booths lined up with one uncomfortable person, so the office should have some extra value!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "office"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, while you get up from your seat to walk to the restroom, you see a slide of a presentation event taking place in the communication area and become interested in it, or some such "unexpected interaction".

- >  If you're working alone, it's important not to be uncomfortable, but it's a bit different if there are lots of booths lined up with one uncomfortable person, so the office should have some extra value
- Where is this "office" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>The before corona was naively in the physical world, the after corona accelerated the discussion of moving it to virtual space.

- Where is this "office" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Consider the office between people, excluding from the virtual office discussion the work done by one person, since it can be completed at home.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I kind of want to make it flow smoothly against what is causing stagnation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Think about offices between people, excluding from the discussion of virtual offices the work done by one person, since it can be completed at home.
- What would you like to see happen regarding this "office"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>We want to be able to enjoy the benefits that used to accrue when we were physically gathered without having to physically gather.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen in the "office" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>That is not very clear. He feels that "simply having people in a virtual space isn't enough," and that we need "to be able to modify that space, one by one."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the "office," can it do that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>That's what Micra's introduction was intended to do.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  Think about offices between people, excluding from the discussion of virtual offices the work done by one person, since it can be completed at home.
- How do you know this "office"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>You can't know without experience and observation, so it is necessary to first create a new "office" and observe it, even if it is not 100% perfect from the beginning
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where does this "office" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Now I'm making it, but an unexpected event needs to occur from the interaction of multiple people, and this needs to be unexpected to me, so I have to create a place where it is likely to occur and wait for it to occur with probability.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What does this "office" look like?
