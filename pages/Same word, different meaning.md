- A uses the symbol S1 as an honest word to express M1 in a certain sense.
- When Mr. B hears this, he says, "Symbol S1 means meaning M2!" he says
    - For example, Mr. A may argue that S1 is a word used only for the purpose of insulting, whereas S1 is used without the intention of insulting.
    - Even if there are examples in front of you that you use without the intention of insulting, you don't bend your interpretation of what you think "this word means".
- For Mr. A, who was told that, S1 and M2 do not correspond.
    - If the use of symbol S1 is banned, M1 will lose its means of expression, so I hope you can at least suggest an alternative.

However, since Mr. B does not bend to his own interpretation (S1 = M2), communication becomes a parallel line.

- Introducing an [[asym-chat]]-like system
- B's request "don't use symbol S1" is not delivered directly to A, but stocked in [[intermediary AI]].
- The intermediary AI can transform/reverse the symbol S1 used by A to symbol S2 for B. This is a kind of [[translation]] and is not difficult
