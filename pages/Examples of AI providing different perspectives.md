    - > The selection and division of blind spot cards is an important means of broadening one's perspective on problem solving. Each card offers a different perspective, and when combined, they provide deeper understanding and new insights. --- [[Blind Card Candidate]]
    - > Note emphasizes the importance of living in the present and finding what is important rather than looking for answers. Fragments, on the other hand, point to a contradiction between living and learning. They offer different perspectives on the meaning and purpose of living. --- [[Rather than searching for the meaning of our birth, we should feel that we are alive right now, and find more important things than answers, one by one.]]
    - > These fragments offer different perspectives on power and strength. For example, "Should Strengths or Values be Prioritized?" indicates ideas about how strength should be used. Strengths that Seem Strong" illustrates that there is often a gap between apparent strength and actual strength. Strength without Fear emphasizes the importance of the ability to keep moving forward in the face of challenges. Voice and Power explores the dynamics between the powerful and the powerless. --- [[Power is not strength.]]
    - > Notebooks and fragment "quaternions" are complementary to each other in terms of the dimensional transformation of information. This provides different perspectives from which to understand and interpret information. Projecting high-dimensional information onto lower dimensions transforms information into a form that is easier for humans to understand, while extending low-dimensional information into higher dimensions allows us to represent more complex phenomena. --- [[Remembering the dimensions we are discarding]].
