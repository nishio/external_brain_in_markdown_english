- [[principle of inclusion]] and [[Möbius inversion formula]]

The functions f and g defined on the power set 2^S of a finite set S are
${\displaystyle g(A)=\sum _{B\subseteq A}f(B)}$
if it satisfies the following conditions,
${\displaystyle f(A)=\sum _{B\subseteq A}(-1)^{\left|A\setminus B\right|}g(B).}$
This form is the [[Möbius inversion formula]] in [[adjacent algebra]] of the semi-ordered set 2^S.
