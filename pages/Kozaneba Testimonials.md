- I tried [[Kozaneba]], which I had seen the name of but had somehow touched, through the tutorial.
        - thankful<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Looks like a good simple digital version of the sticky note grouping thing.
    - I'm not sure how to write the arrows.
        - You're right, the arrow function wasn't in the tutorial because it was added after the tutorial was created.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - [/kozaneba-forum-jp/release-note#6139c971aff09e00001d3b81](https://scrapbox.io/kozaneba-forum-jp/release-note#6139c971aff09e00001d3b81).
            - I'll make a page for it later, since it was only explained in the release notes.
                - Yay!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I wrote!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - [[Line Drawing Function]]
                - Should I mentions these things?
                - I don't think you have to.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>
                    - If you want to be a little more proactive, <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/takker/icon' alt='/villagepump/takker.icon' height="19.5"/>, use [[@]]!
    - I think it's probably no different or a little faster than doing it with real sticky notes and pens, but for some reason I feel frustrated (not so much) when I do it digitally, as if I can't get more speed.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - Why not?
        - Maybe I'm just not used to it yet.
            - Maybe I'm not used to making maps with sticky notes to think about in the first place.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The area to be moved has become "infinitely wider" rather than faster,[[Don't worry about the edge of your desk.]] 」がメリットで、速くなったのは付箋を作るところ。紙に手で描くのと複数行テキストを一発で流し込めるのでは桁違い<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - certainly<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/miyamonz/icon' alt='/villagepump/miyamonz.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I guess it's important to be infinitely spacious.
            - I've never done anything like this with physical sticky notes, so I wasn't aware of it.
