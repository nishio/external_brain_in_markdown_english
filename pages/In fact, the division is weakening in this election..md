In fact, the division is weakening in this election / [[2024 US Presidential Election]].

I don't think it's a good idea to attribute "differences in thinking" to educational background when people who are different from you make different decisions than you.

- >  Brutal Fact: Red states in the U.S. (strongly Republican states) have a lower percentage of state residents with college degrees than the national average of 43.1%, and states with more college graduates than average become blue states (strongly Democratic). States with college graduation rates about the national average will be "close states" where Republicans and Democrats are close.

- There's something "weird" about the thinking here that convinces me to shove something complex into one bit of "college graduate or not".
- Maybe because we live in a huddle of "people with similar attributes", we feel like our similar thinking is the majority and the norm, and we consider people who think differently than we do to be the "few exceptions".
- [[geographic filter bubble]]
- So when the side you thought was the "few exceptions" wins, it causes cognitive dissonance and confusion.
    - It's important to try to see things with your own eyes, not to stay inside [[filter bubble]].

In fact, the division is weakening in this election.
- > [zeeko3b](https://x.com/zeeko3b/status/1854399062541541696) The real "brutal fact" is that the Democrats are not getting the educated vote, the women vote, or the minority vote as much as they say they are, and this time, Republican support is increasing in all of those groups. I think.

- >  >konoy541: Someone has already pointed out that the difference in "education" between the current supporters of the Democrats and Republicans is a straightforward fact, but I guess the question is why you presented it as a "cruel fact". What did you consider "cruel"? I mean.
    - Republican support is increasing in all segments except white college-educated women and the elderly, ugh.
    - Instead, we've had a two-party system up to now, and the United States is divided, and this time the division is lessening.
        - In that sense, Japan, which has been under the LDP for most of its history, has been less divided, and the recent lower house election has unusually divided society.
        - If you want to reduce fragmentation, the ideal is domination by the Chinese Communist Party (...)
    - I'm starting to feel that it's better not to reduce the division, but rather to increase it, so that it's "normal to be divided in some way from your neighbor.
- > [zeeko3b](https://x.com/zeeko3b/status/1854414953123561884) Here is a graph that shows that the Republican vote actually increased considerably in blue states that usually don't get much attention because the winner of electoral votes is already decided. The red shift in large metropolitan states with large populations is probably one of the main reasons why Trump won this time in the popular boat (total votes) as well.

- > [zeeko3b](https://x.com/zeeko3b/status/1854416586154954834) The bottom line is that the Democratic stronghold and bedrock support base has been cut off to a significant degree while blaming the cause of the defeat on something "divisive" or "the other side of the river".
- >  In this situation, anyone who claims that there are no Trump supporters around them may simply not be trusted enough or have enough friends to reveal their true intentions.
