title: "Feedback to those who are not good imho."

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1750576803645935642) On the topic of "how to [[feedback]] when a [[young man]] is doing something not good enough," the first thing I said was, "That [["not good enough"]] is just a subjective impression. So, if you stand in front of a young man on that basis, he will only be considered as "[[an old man]] [[annoying]] who interferes with [[baseless assumption]]", and so on.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1750577391137898909) We talked about how it would be better to go through with it, "You think it's the right thing to do, please go ahead and release it to the market. I did. But after some time and some thought...(continued)

Or, the few people who admire the act are the only ones who are "[[awakened to the truth]]".

    - [[conspiracy theory]]  /  [[idea of being part of a chosen people]]
    - [[Early adopters and electorate]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1750582664657277043) I can't deny the idea that the only market is those who admire what you do. We don't live in an age where everyone has almost the same values anymore, and there will always be people who say no no matter what you do. Aiming to win in [[the game of mass attention]] is just another value system.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1750583222222884879) Well, ultimately, the feeling of "I give [[advice]] to others to be better, and I want them to be better by following it" is itself an act of demanding others to share in your subjective No one has the right to force the other person to behave in a certain way.
    - [[Feedback is the desire to modify others]]
