> Web3] technology used in Comic
- > Comic is a service based on Web3 technology. Connect an Ethereum wallet to login and use ETH, the Ethereum cryptocurrency, for payment. The worldwide open currency makes it possible to make payments while respecting the creators' expressions, and enables works to reach fans in various countries.
- > Payments are made through Ethereum smart contracts, and creators' sales are transferred directly to their wallets the moment they are sold. In the future, we plan to implement a system that automatically distributes sales among creators when selling works created by a team.
