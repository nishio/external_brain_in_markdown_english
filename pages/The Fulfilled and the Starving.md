title: "The Fulfilled and the Starving"
---

The hungry and unfulfilled seek to take from those who are fulfilled.

Sordid discussions on social networking sites
- Most of the time, it's just hungry people trying to take something from others.
    - Not a productive discussion.
- When people are starving each other, they take each other's food and get into epic fights.
- Even those who are not starving can start to see their opponents as enemies and start to fight because of their attempts to rob them.
