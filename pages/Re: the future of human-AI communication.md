- I drew 2A, but 2B is correct.
- Words near the surface of the water are only [[understandable]] to me.
- Even those words can be written down.
- The higher up the mountain you go, the easier it is to share with others.
        - [[Public and private language]]
- [[Having ChatGPT explain it has the effect of "landing on something understandable to the average person."]]
    - This page is about the term "[[landing]]".

- If you write an article in Japanese that is intended to be read by others, you tend to be under the delusion that others will understand it.
        - [[Understandable is an unverified delusion]]
    - In fact, if you write it in Japanese, of course most of the world won't understand it, and if you write it in English, quite a lot of people won't understand it.
