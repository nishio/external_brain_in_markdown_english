[[XREAL One]]
- I tried to get by without glasses, or with glasses and a stack of glasses, but I give up.
- It is more wasteful to reduce the frequency of utilization of the device bought due to [[mental friction]] caused by the lack of visibility.

I have to go to Ginza on 3/4, so let's do it at that time.

I can make a reservation online, so I'll go anyway.

I did some tests that I don't usually do very often.
I was allowed to take pictures of it because it was interesting, but the middle and right sides would be medical procedures, so I didn't give any commentary.

This image shows the measurement result screen of the ophthalmic examination device (OPD-Scan III). It mainly displays information on the optical properties of the cornea for analysis and use in vision correction and surgical planning. The following is a brief explanation of the important items.

## Main measurements:

- Median refractive index.
    - Spherical power (Sph): -2.00D
    - Astigmatism (Cyl): -1.75D for 3.00mm, -0.25D for 5.00mm
    - Axis: 63° at 3.00mm
    - RMS (amount of aberration): 0.32D (at 3.00mm)

- The number "-" indicates the degree of myopia or astigmatism. The higher the number, the stronger the myopia or astigmatism.

- Corneal shape (SimK value)
    - SimK: 41.32D @163° / 40.66D @73°
    - Astigmatism: 0.65D
    - Q value: -0.35 (index of corneal asphericity)

- A negative Q value means that the cornea is flat.

- Astigmatism information
    - Near fundus: +0.00 @2°, near the bottom of the eye
    - Cornea: +0.65 @73°, +0.65 @73°, +0.65 @73°, +0.65 @73°.
    - Intraocular: +1.11 @158°, Intraocular: +1.11 @158

- Separate indication of whether the astigmatism is caused by the cornea or intraocular (e.g., lens).

- Pupil information.
    - Pupil diameter in bright light (bright location): 2.86mm, deviation from center: 0.17mm @318°.
    - Pupil diameter in night vision (in dark place): 3.84mm, deviation from center: 0.16mm @303°.

It measures the size of the pupil and its deviation from the center of the pupil and is especially useful in predicting surgery and corrected vision.

These are the basic information that can be read on this examination screen. It mainly shows data on the degree of myopia and astigmatism, the condition of the cornea, the source of astigmatism, and the size and position of the pupil.

Briefly and simply,
- Slightly nearsighted (difficulty seeing in the distance)
- I also have a little astigmatism (blurred or double vision).
- Slightly uneven curve of the cornea (surface of the eye)
However, it is not enough to cause special problems and can be corrected normally with ordinary glasses or contact lenses.



After this, I did a further examination, different from what I usually do at the ophthalmologist's office, and found that the center of the right eye and the left eye in the neutral state were off-center.
They say about 80% of IT people are in this state.
Maybe it's the smart phone. w
Is that why the letters get separated and hard to see when I get tired?
I've only found nearsightedness in my regular eye exams.
I'll prescribe you a prescription for weak nearsightedness in your right eye and weak astigmatism in your left eye. I'll prescribe for weak myopia in your right eye and weak astigmatism in your left eye."
You were like.

This time, I'm here to buy an inner lens for XREAL.
And I'm just saying that if you add prism correction to it, when you remove the XREAL, you lose the correction and it's confusing, that's true.
The budget for a new pair of glasses is an order of magnitude more than the budget for a new pair of glasses.
In the meantime, maybe I should stop using my phone with one hand and rehab it...

(Write when you know the amount to be paid)

After I took this, I opened the box of XREAL frames and said, "Huh? It's empty?" And it was.

- This one was the real one.
- Was it a screw or something that was removed to make this.

- Oh, easy to see
- In other words, I've had bad eyesight until now.
- Right after it's removed, the monitor is blurry.
    - It gets better after a while.
    - but it's more beautiful when it's hanging.
    - The resolution of the virtual world is higher than that of the real world.

They say, "If it's lost or damaged within a year of delivery, we can re-create it at a 30% discount."
