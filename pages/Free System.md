Backgrounds:.
- Japanese government agencies lack digital human resources, and are challenged with opportunities to acquire basic and fundamental IT literacy, an essential understanding of systems, and an environment and personnel system that can respond to digital change.
- Coordination between systems and balancing security and convenience are also issues.

Proposal for a "free system":.
- In contrast to the existing "rigid system," an environment of a "free system" will be developed in which administrative staff can freely experiment with the system.
- It will be realized in a form that enables joint use and joint construction by multiple government agencies, and will also promote national and local cooperation and collaboration, as well as exchange with the private sector and young local human resources.
- Equipped with a risk coping mechanism, start small with a small budget, and devise a personnel structure.

This proposal aims to realize the development and discovery of digital human resources and technology creation in government organizations, and to create internationally competitive digital technologies. Based on the success factors of past technological innovations by Japanese companies, the report discusses the possibility of creating astonishing ICT technological innovations from large companies and government agencies by taking advantage of the strengths of Japanese-style organizations that have dared to retain irrationality.
