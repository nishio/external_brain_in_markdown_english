- Not being unaware of the mistake, but unconsciously distorting the perception that it is okay not to fix it.
- You distort your perception because you think it's too hard to erase and start over.
- When I actually turned it off and started over, it was easier than I thought it would be and turned out better than I thought it would.
- This experience freed me from the "habit of distorting perceptions for fear of erasing and starting over."

As discussed in the latter part of the article, with digital, the psychological hurdle is low because you can "redo without erasing" such as "save to another layer".

Programming is the same, if the design is wrong, it should be redone.

- [[cognitive distortion]]
- [[redo]]
