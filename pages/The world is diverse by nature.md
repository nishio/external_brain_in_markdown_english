"[[Diversity]] exists [[originally]] in [[the world]]."

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>This view is similar to the philosophical position of "[[pluralism]].
Pluralism is the idea that the world consists of multiple entities or principles rather than a single principle or entity. However, it is sometimes expressed as "[[diversity principle]]" in some contexts, so the name is not generally fixed.
(Thoughts: I think this is another expression that depends on a specific context)
