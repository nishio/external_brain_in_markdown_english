    - Concepts in [[Nodal Point of Thought2019-02-18]].
- The [[RECOMMENDATION]] engine for similar entries is "long text to long text"
    - [[search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)]] is "keywords -> long text"
- The Scrapbox link display is
    - Page -> keywords contained on that page -> pages containing those keywords."
    - In other words, it can be interpreted as a combination of "long text -> keywords" and "keywords -> long text".
    - [[2-hop link]] did it twice more
- Scrapbox is [[stock of associations]], given the idea that this process is [[suggestion]].
- This associative connection is a virtual directed graph
- A few steps of exploration of this graph will generally result in a very wide distribution
- So the approach of "presenting a few randomly selected items that have been explored for a few steps" doesn't really produce anything very useful.
    - As I thought of in [[Nodal Point of Thought2019-02-18]], we can treat this association to connect as [[distance]], and it might be useful in that usage
- Maybe we should take some time to re-think this discussion.

    - I feel we are one step closer to the realization of the [[Knowledge Weaving Program]].
