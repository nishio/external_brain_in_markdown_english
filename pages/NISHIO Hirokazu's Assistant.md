2024-05-05 Ver. 1.1 released
I have been writing various blogs in the style of "Yasukazu Nishio's", but this time, LLM has finally started to distribute them in any language instead of directly from my writings, so they are now written in English.

2024-05-07 Added [[Nihia]] to the name. I put [[Nihia]] in the name to make it easier to [[GPT Mention]].
