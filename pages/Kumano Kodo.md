[First Kumano Kodo in Nakahechi Produced by Ryujin Bus](https://www.ryujinbus.com/tour/)
[[Nakahechi]]

> According to the Tanabe City Tourism Promotion Division, the Kumano Kodo, a World Heritage site, has an ingenious way to prevent people from getting lost. Along the ancient road in Nakaheji, there are signposts at 500 meter intervals, each with a number indicating its location. In the event of an emergency, the location can be identified by giving the number, so it is recommended that people remember this information.
