title: "Mathematical terms that don't mean much"
---

When "[[mathematical term]]" is used outside of mathematics, it often means "[[not much]]."
- But not in all cases.

Checking the definition of a mathematical term that doesn't mean much doesn't get much value because it's not used in that deep of a sense.

A prime example of a mathematical word that doesn't mean much but is often used outside of mathematics would be [[semilachis]] ([[semilattice]]).
    - Half of [[lattice]] ([[bundle]], そく), so semi-lattice (half-bundle).
- [https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/束_(bundle-theory)](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/束_(bundle-theory))
- In a crude way, a bundle is one point on the top and one point on the bottom, and a half bundle is one point only on one of them.

- [[The higher the level of abstraction, the wider the range of application.]]
- It's got a wider range of applications, and it's popping up here and there, which makes it seem more important.


[[Mathematical concepts are blocks of squares]].
- The mathematical concept is [[square block]].
- The reason why we put so much effort into making sure it's in good shape is so that it can be [[piling up]].
- It's over speculative to use math concepts where they don't need to be built up.
