The phrase refers primarily to British foreign policy during the [[Victorian]] era and is cited by many historians and political scientists.

PUBLIC OPINION (1921)

The democrat has understood what an analysis of public opinion seems
to demonstrate: that in dealing with an unseen environment decisions
“are manifestly settled at haphazard, which clearly they ought not to
be.” [[Footnote: Aristotle, Politics, Bk. VII, Ch. IV.]] So he
has always tried in one way or another to minimize the importance of
that unseen environment. He feared foreign trade because trade
involves foreign connections; he distrusted manufactures because they
produced big cities and collected crowds; if he had nevertheless to
have manufactures, he wanted protection in the interest of
self-sufficiency. When he could not find these conditions in the real
world, he went passionately into the wilderness, and founded Utopian
communities far from foreign contacts. His slogans reveal his
prejudice. He is for Self-Government, Self-Determination,
Independence. Not one of these ideas carries with it any notion of
consent or community beyond the frontiers of the self-governing
groups. The field of democratic action is a circumscribed area. Within
protected boundaries the aim has been to achieve self-sufficiency and
avoid entanglement. This rule is not confined to foreign policy, but
it is plainly evident there, because life outside the national
boundaries is more distinctly alien than any life within. And as
history shows, democracies in their foreign policy have had generally
to choose between splendid isolation and a diplomacy that violated
their ideals. The most successful democracies, in fact, Switzerland,
Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and America until recently, have had
no foreign policy in the European sense of that phrase. Even a rule
like the Monroe Doctrine arose from the desire to supplement the two
oceans by a glacis of states that were sufficiently republican to have
no foreign policy.

Since the democrat understands, as his analysis of public opinion shows, that decisions in dealing with the invisible environment "are clearly made without planning," "it clearly ought not to be so" (footnote: Aristotle, Politics, Vol. VII, Chapter IV). Therefore, he has always tried to minimize the importance of that invisible environment in some way. He feared foreign trade because of the foreign connections it entailed, and distrusted the manufacturing industries that produced large cities and crowds. If manufacturing was still needed, he wanted protection for self-sufficiency. When he could not find these conditions in the real world, he passionately went into the wilderness and built a utopian community with no foreign contact. His slogans reveal his prejudices. He espouses self-government, self-determination, and independence. None of these ideas entail the concept of consent or community beyond the borders of an autonomous group. The place for democratic action is a limited area. The goal within protected boundaries is to achieve self-sufficiency and avoid becoming entangled. This rule is not limited to foreign policy and is particularly evident there. This is because life outside a nation's boundaries is distinctly more heterogeneous than life inside. And as history has shown, democracies have generally had to choose in their foreign policies between glorious isolation and diplomacy that violates their ideals. Indeed the most successful democracies, Switzerland, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and until recently the United States, have had no foreign policy in the European sense. Even rules such as the Monroe Doctrine, in addition to the two oceans, arose from the desire to supplement the bulwarks of states that were sufficiently republican and had no foreign policy.
