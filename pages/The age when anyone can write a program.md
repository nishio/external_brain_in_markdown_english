title: "The age when anyone can write a program"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643626028449906693) I've seen the expression "in an age when anyone can write a program", but I don't think it conveys the message as intended because it associates it with "the programs of today". Rather, that replying "I can't do it" to "you can do it if you write a program" would be like saying "I can only do it with a calculator" to "you can do it with Excel".
