title: "Pasta Logic Naming"

2019/10/10
temporary name
Board game development code name

- [The "Spaghetti Code" rule was significantly changed as a result of the [[20190930 Rule Amendment]].
At first we called it ver.2, etc., but it would be better if we gave it a new development code name.
- Since "spaghetti code" is a common noun and not very googlable, how about a little twist?
- Spaghetti → Pasta
- [[pasta logic]]
