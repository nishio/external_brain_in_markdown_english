Organizing the Current Situation
- dd2030: [digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai: Broad Listening AI (Digital Democracy 2030 Broad Listening)](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai)
- Team Mirai: [team-mirai/kouchou-ai: Kouchou AI (Digital Democracy 2030 Broad Listening)](https://github.com/team-mirai/kouchou-ai)
    - Once forked and developed, major functions were PR'd in dd2030 and now stopped.
        - [[click on the broadband AI to jump to the link]].
- Team Mirai Volunteers:.
    - [team-mirai-volunteer/policy-pr-hub: A system to analyze and utilize policy improvement proposals gathered by the Idobata policy system.](https://github.com/team-mirai-volunteer/policy-pr-hub)
    - Trial and error of new visualization and analysis methods based on the analysis data of the broadening AI for Team Mirai's policy pluric data.
    - demo site: [https://policy-pr-hub.vercel.app/](https://policy-pr-hub.vercel.app/)
- [[Wide-ranging AI analysis of the issue of wide-ranging AI]].
    - demo: [https://nishio.github.io/issues-kouchou-ai/github-issues-analysis/](https://nishio.github.io/issues-kouchou-ai/github-issues-analysis/)
    - Analysis of Issues in dd2030's Wide Hearing AI Repository.
    - Image links are broken when deploying to GitHub Pages
- [[YouTube comment spreading AI]].
    - I've been thinking about what to do with this for a while now.
    - I'm having a hard time doing a broadband AI analysis of the broadband AI issue on dd2030.
        - I noticed that the "click to jump to the link" function on the AI is broken, right?
            - It's hard to get excited about what you're trying to do when you're not ready to do it.
        - Static HTML output, links to images not broken? And.
        - The discrepancy between Devin's Ruff and CI's Ruff is also a turnoff.
    - I have created a private fork (and deployed to a new Azure environment from it), so I'm just going to use it as it is and publish it at an appropriate time.
        - It's too much trouble to do PR in small units, so we're going to do it all together like Team Mirai did.
            - [Feature implemented in team-mirai fork repo by nasuka - Pull Request #582 - digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-ai [https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-](https://github.com/digitaldemocracy2030/kouchou-) ai/pull/582]
        - Maybe by the time this is published, the AI agents will be smarter, so the AI can do things like organizing the code for publication only.
