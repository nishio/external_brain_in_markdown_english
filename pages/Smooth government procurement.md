The "smooth" part Audrey Tang refers to is the flexible, step-free cooperation that emerges between the government and the civil sector.
The traditional [[government procurement]] or [[grant]] system tends to be a zero-one structure where "only one vendor wins the bid and that's it," but with the introduction of [[Quadratic Funding]] and a prize-type approach,
- While the government funds the project,
- Easier to maintain autonomy and independence on the part of the project and community
This makes it easier to combine the advantages of both.

In other words, a "just-right" situation is created, which Audrey describes as "smooth": government support is provided, but it is up to the private sector and citizens to decide how to do things. As a result, a new model of collaboration is likely to emerge, one in which government and citizens continue to work together.
