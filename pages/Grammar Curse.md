> Individual concepts in philosophy are neither arbitrary nor spontaneous; they grow under interrelationships and kinship with other concepts. ...
> This immediately explains the striking "familial similarities" between Indian, Greek, and German philosophy. ...
    - [[familial resemblance]]
> Where there is an analogy of language, because the basic ideas of grammar are identical--which means that similar grammatical functions unconsciously dominate and guide the philosophical system is always developed and arranged in a similar way...
> Philosophers from the [[Ural-Altaic]] world (where the [[concept of subject]] is very late in development) will probably look at the world differently and take a different path than philosophers from the Indo-Germanic world or even Muslims. The curse of the function of a particular grammar is ultimately nothing more than a curse of physiological value judgments and race-specific conditions.
