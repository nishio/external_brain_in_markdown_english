> [kapo2392](https://x.com/kapo2392/status/1961607698019205628) Ryu Murakami once said something like, "A person who makes a mistake can become a professional." Most people, for example, see the guitar playing of Katsumi Watanabe and give up on becoming a professional Most people give up on becoming a professional guitarist after seeing Katsumi Watanabe's guitar playing, for example, but on the rare occasions when they think, "Is this okay? It's not that bad," and then they try to play it and wonder why it doesn't work, and through trial and error they get really good at it. In other words, the initial misunderstanding is the starting point, and it is only through repetition, trying to fill in the discrepancies with reality, that one acquires technique and expression. Therefore, "Be [[humility]], don't be mistaken" sounds plausible, but in a sense, it deprives people of the opportunity to try things out and [[nips in the bud their potential]].

They do not reflect on what they did wrong. Such a type of person will continue to practice endlessly, feeling "I wonder why I'm not good at this, but I should be. And at the end of it all, they really acquire the ability to do it. I started my current job with the misconception, "Isn't this easy? But as it turns out, I am glad that I started with that misconception. If I had thought at the time that I could not do it, I would not exist today.
