In 2021, "Where's that book? It wasn't cut and scanned, was it?" And I looked for it.
- I had taken pictures of the contents so I could identify which box it was in.

I've never taken it out, so this is my first time taking it out.
- It says something to the effect of signing up at 1:00 on Saturday and getting it Sunday morning, do you think I'll get it?
- And by the way, I ordered a new box.

Arrived on schedule.
- The people who brought empty boxes were not the same as those who brought boxes of books.

The box that holds the books (book kit) has a double bottom to withstand the weight.

- Last time I only bought a book kit, but this time I also bought a regular box, this one is a regular cardboard box and I have to use duct tape to fasten it.

- Maybe I should have just used the book kit?

    - I like that I can close my mouth without having to use duct tape.
        - The lid can be temporarily closed to prevent dust and cats from entering, even when the contents are not yet finalized.

I can sign up for a pickup at 5am on Monday morning and they can bring it to me on the fastest Monday 8-10pm flight.
- I decided to have them take three boxes anyway.
