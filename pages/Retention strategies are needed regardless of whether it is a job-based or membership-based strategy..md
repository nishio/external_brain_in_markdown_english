Retention strategies are needed regardless of whether it is a job-based or membership-based strategy.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1756502065789219107) In order to store knowledge capital and social-relationship capital in a company, doesn't it inevitably have to be membership-based employment rather than job-based?

> [masanork](https://twitter.com/masanork/status/1757032426495410246) That is not true. In areas where both knowledge and social capital can be accumulated within the industry, where similar jobs are available in various companies, and where the job market is structured in such a way that knowledge can be utilized even after changing jobs. And the tech sector seems to be relatively manageable.

In the company", doesn't this have a negative effect on "accumulating knowledge and social capital **in the company**"?

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1757037880495702114) Indeed. It was an overstatement to say that "we must inevitably become a membership-based employment rather than a job-based employment" because if we offer higher compensation than the market pay level, we can keep people connected even in a job-based employment.
