title: "Dictionary creation assistance"
---

- I am of the school of thought that one must first increase the intellectual productivity of individuals before increasing the [[intellectual productivity of the team]], but once we limit our thinking to teams, we need to solve the problem of "different people using the same word with different [[meaning]]," and I feel that we should incorporate dictionary creation assistance into our products. I feel that we need to solve the problem of "people using the same word but with different [[meaning]]" and should incorporate dictionary creation assistance into the product.

- If [[Words you don't understand]] is selected, if it is already in the dictionary, it will be displayed, if not, it will be recorded as a candidate and the number of people demanded will be incremented.

I wonder if there should also be a mechanism to send new notifications to those who are enthusiastic about maintaining the dictionary.
