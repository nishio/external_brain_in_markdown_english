title: "People who want to meddle in other people's choices."
---

Even if the [[tool]] that others are using seems not good for them, they just don't have to use it themselves, but for some reason, some people want to interfere with other people's choices. They are [[uneasy about their own choice]], but they want to turn away from that [[anxiety]], and I think they try to think that their choice is right indirectly by criticizing others' choices.

[[who denies others tools]].

The usefulness of a tool depends on the situation. We do not know the situation others are in. We cannot judge whether a tool is appropriate if we do not know the situation.
