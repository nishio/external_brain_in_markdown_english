> [@imaitetsuya](https://twitter.com/imaitetsuya/status/1564446874505211904): By the way, in the book "The Container Story", there is a story about how the spread of containers caused a revolution in the logistics industry, and as a result, one industry called "offshore brokerage" (cargo handling workers) disappeared entirely. It's interesting to read about how a whole industry called "offshore brokerage" (cargo handlers) disappeared as a result of a revolution in the logistics industry with the spread of containers, and how port towns that had flourished until then became completely obsolete and declined due to the lack of water depth to accommodate container ships.
