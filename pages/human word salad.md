title: "human word salad"
---

When we see a meaningful sentence with a mixture of known and unknown keywords, we try to read the meaning, but it may actually be [[word salad]], or a human being may be creating a word salad.

How can we avoid wasting time by getting caught up in those things?

How can I identify if a sentence I don't understand is a meaningless word salad or if it is just beyond my [[understanding]]?
