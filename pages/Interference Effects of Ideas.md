BAD does not mean "bad." It just means "a collection of specific data."

The story of how a "[[primary idea]]" (some may call it a "[[hypothesis]]") inspired by the data collected develops afterwards.
- [[collapse]]" in which contradictory information appears.
- Undeveloped," in which no particularly relevant information appears and remains the same.
- Gaining Stability," in which several similar pieces of information appear.
- [[Achievement of inclusiveness]]" in which information that might be relevant emerges and higher-order ideas are launched.

I think it is difficult to tell the difference between gaining stability and gaining inclusiveness because this is all on one diagram.
- Stability gains are merely supported from blocks 2, 3, and 4.
- The acquisition of inclusiveness is born out of 1 and 2, becomes even higher in connection with 3, and then becomes even higher in connection with 4, and then combines once again with the others in 1.
- The right-to-left arrows on the cumulative process (perhaps it's just the age of vertically written books, but it doesn't feel right now).
    - I tried to redraw the picture with [[Cumulative effect of ideas]].

It is the process of increasing certainty through [[knowledge consistency]] that leads to stability and inclusiveness without leading to underdevelopment or downfall.

- [[idea]]   [[consistent association]]
- When ideas contradict each other, it is the "downfall" in this diagram

- [[KJ method is pseudo-3D]]
