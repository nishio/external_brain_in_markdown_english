    - [[2020 Unexplored Corporation: Project Generation Growth Process]]
    - from [Mitou Foundation| PROJECTS](https://www.mitou.org/projects/index.html)
    - > MITOH is an "innovation platform" that builds a "pool of advanced IT human resources" including MITOH creators and creates projects to solve social issues. In order to achieve the above, we will build a "pool of advanced IT human resources" to create technology-based solutions and a "collaboration hub" to implement solutions by advanced IT human resources in society. From the pool of advanced IT human resources, those with "strong passion" and "appropriate skills" to solve a specific social issue will create a solution (MVP) to solve that social issue and help it become a product or service that is actually implemented in society.
        - I won't put it on the poster because it's too long.

        - [[great things are great]]
        - > "What do I have to do?"/ Going back to the fundamentals/ The evaluation criteria are not aligned/ "If you are amazing, you are amazing". The significance of the unexplored is that it brought in a simple evaluation: "If you're awesome, you'll be chosen as a super creator." / The Internet has diversified the context, and no one is looking at things in the same context / The unexplored can compete with the next person on the basis of "greatness" / The unexplored can properly convey greatness / This is what is required at the unexplored. I believe that once you go through such a place, you will become a high impact person.
            - I tried to summarize, but it was impossible to shrink it down to the amount that would fit on a poster.
    - [[No more ideology without implementation.]]
    - > Transforming non-economically rational technology into economically rational technology through impact / Visionaries with their hands in motion / Philosophies that do not involve things have poor presentation skills / The interesting thing about unexplored is that you can compete with your neighbors in terms of "awesomeness" / It is important to be able to convey awesomeness properly

The legacy communication method of paper posters is limited in the amount of information it can convey due to narrow bandwidth 💁 for more information.
