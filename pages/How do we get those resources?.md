- If you are listening to a talk and the speaker feels a value for a certain R (this is called "R is [[Resources]]")
- 「 [[Where do those resources come from?]] 」
- 「 [[How do we get those resources?]] 」
- [[question]] such as [[question]] is valid

Example
    - [[Enthusiasm is a valuable resource]]
    - →Where does this enthusiasm come from?
    - →How do you get that enthusiasm?
    - →How can this enthusiasm be increased?
