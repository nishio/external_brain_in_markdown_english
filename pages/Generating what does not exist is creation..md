title: "Generating what does not exist is creation."
---

Assuming that "if you generate something that doesn't exist, it will be created" in both good and bad ways seems useful for using generative AI
- Outputs bullshit [[halcyonation]] in response to prompts such as "indicate source paper"
    - It is [[created]] because the human side implicitly assumed it existed when it did not.
- When you want to create something (for example, a new game), if something that meets your requirements already exists, you reproduce what already exists instead of creating something new.
    - Well, sometimes the reproducibility is not 100% and the result is something different.
- In both cases, the problem is that people are making decisions without verifying whether they exist or not.
    - You want to get something existing that exists.
    - You want to create something new that doesn't exist.
