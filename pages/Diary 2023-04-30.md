Yesterday's English conversation school was exclusively a discussion, so not many notes were written down.
So the recordings were transcribed by Whisper and explained by GPT4.

- The conversation involves two people getting to know each other. They discuss the speaker's day, mentioning they are in a small town and not sleeping well due to strange weather. The conversation shifts to the speaker's occupation, where they reveal they are a software engineer and researcher at a software company. They work on research, prototypes, and small trial programs rather than actual products.
    - I'm feeling a bit tired became I'm here in a little town.
- They also talk about where they are from, specifically Osaka. The speaker is from near the end of the shoreline, to the west of Namba, and shares their familiarity with the Chuo line from their college days in Mira. They mention the areas of Tenochi and Ikoma, and briefly compare travel experiences in Tokyo and Saitama.
- In this conversation, the speaker talks about their cat, Touma, who they adopted from a cat shelter. They also discuss their English language skills, which they want to improve to better communicate with people from Taiwan in their job. They anticipate discussing topics related to democracy and the realization of people's opinions with visitors from Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs.
- The conversation shifts towards the differences between Japan and Taiwan, particularly in the area of digital technology. The speaker mentions that Japan has been lagging behind Taiwan in adopting digital technology, giving the example of still relying on physical paper for many government applications. They mention the recent creation of a digital agency in Japan, which aims to drive digital transformation in various sectors, such as agriculture. The speaker also discusses Japan's paper-based voting system, comparing it to the digital ballots used in some places in America. The conversation ends with a mention of the challenges faced during the last U.S. election and the riots that occurred in Washington DC.
- In the conversation, two people are discussing the digitization of various aspects of society, particularly in Japan. They touch on topics such as the January 6th riot in the US, the use of paper ballots in elections, and the need for better internet access in rural areas for educational purposes. They also talk about the importance of making digital tools more accessible for people to express their opinions on different issues and reference the V-Taiwan system in Taiwan, which allows for more direct and dynamic public input on policy issues. Towards the end, they discuss new words and phrases they learned during their conversation.

I reqested to GPT4 to make a list of phrases which the learner should better to remember. Two of those are matched with the phrases by human instructor.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1652493150840315904?s=20): wow, these top two actually match the phrases the instructor chose, wow, this topic is also a good topic for today's English conversation!
