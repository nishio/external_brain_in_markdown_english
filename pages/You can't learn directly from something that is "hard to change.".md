title: 'You can''t learn directly from something that is "hard to change."'

I saw a tweet that put [[things that are easy to change]] and [[things that are difficult to change]] side by side and said, "[[Learn the things that are difficult to change]]."
- How can we learn 'what is hard to change'?"
- "It might be a good idea to start by learning about 'things that are changeable.'"
it came to a point where ...

        - [Knowledge that is difficult to change" means "[[abstraction]]" that is, "[[case-sensitivity]] information removed from [[individual specific cases]]".
    - To get it, you first need to gather [specific information

    - Trying to obtain only [[Versatile]] [[abstract knowledge]] without collecting individual [[specific information]] will not work as expected.

        - > By doing what is planned and executed, it is materialized and output, and the results can be observed. By comparing the results with expectations, the "gap between expectations and reality" (error) is revealed. This error is propagated back by Adjust. Knowledge at a high level of abstraction requires less adjustment.
