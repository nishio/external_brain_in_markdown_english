    - Purple managed to pull from all over the existing plant as appropriate, but the conveyor belt became spaghetti.
    - Considering green design...

    - Hmmm, maybe I'll make a fresh start on a new continent...
- Automatic production of green cubes has begun.

    - All assembled in Tier 1, 4.4/min.
        - The bottleneck is the silicon supply, well, we're making it from stone. I wonder if we can pull a conveyor belt from the spaceport to here.
    - 4.4/min means you can make 10000 pieces in 38 hours, so you could leave it on through the weekend.
    - After trying out a box of silicon with a plentiful supply, I found that the next bottleneck is double deuterium. This is troubling...we'll have to build an accelerator.
    - After building the accelerator, the next bottleneck was graphene. It was hard to tell because it was pulled from far away so there was a buffer on the belt, but graphene was consumed when carbon nanotubes were made to build the accelerator.
    - Oh, we can make graphene and hydrogen from Jupiter's burning ice. We could build a spaceport nearby to supply silicon, graphene and hydrogen.
- They say it's luck if there is a FireIce on Jupiter at the start.
