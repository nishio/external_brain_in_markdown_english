Proof of Humanity" mainly refers to a mechanism or concept that "proves that the subject (user or participant) is a human being. For example, in the following contexts

1.### [[CAPTCHA]]
- A test to confirm "I am not a robot" on websites. The system uses distorted text and image selections to prove "humanness" by imposing tasks that are difficult to perform with automated mechanical processing.

2.### Turing Test
]
- A test to determine if a computer can show "human-like" characteristics in a dialogue. An attempt to determine whether or not the other party is truly human, based on the naturalness of the response and understanding of the context.

3.### "[[Proof of Humanity]]" in Blockchain context
- A mechanism to guarantee one account per person for virtual currency and decentralized applications. It is used to prevent duplication and spoofing, and to ensure fairness in voting and reward distribution on a "per-person" basis.

These are all designed to prove that they are operated by a real "person" and not by a machine or multiple fake accounts.
