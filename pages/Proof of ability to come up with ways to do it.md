title: "Proof of ability to come up with ways to do it"
---

The desire to achieve alone
There are about three levels.
- I want to do something X.
- I've come up with a way Y to achieve something seemingly difficult X, and I want to verify if it's really possible to do it with Y.
- I want to verify that I have the ability to come up with a feasible solution to a difficult problem.

Each of these will have a variant of "I want others to see me as that kind of person Z" here.
- People who "want to be seen as Z" give up easily when Z is difficult because "being Z" is not a requirement.
- Image of a person who falsifies papers
    - I don't want to know the truth, I want to be "the guy who wrote a great paper".
