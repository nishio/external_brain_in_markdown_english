title: "The largest number less than 5 is 5"
---

> No context whatsoever, but an elementary school student was making the assertion that the largest number less than 5 is 5, and I wondered if he didn't distinguish between 'less than' and 'less than'. I thought so and asked him for his rationale. (To simplify) "4.9<4.99<4.999<... <4.99999.... He claimed "=5", so I explained the difference between maximum and upper bound, upper bound = minimum upper bound

I want to be an adult who can listen to these things without making fun of them.
