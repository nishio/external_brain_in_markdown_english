Different people have or do not have different things.
Defining happiness as having what you have.
Up to the point of using this as one's subjective standard of happiness is fine.
Don't consider those who don't have it to be unhappy.
That's because I set my own standards of happiness for others.

The term "right to the pursuit of happiness" is a little low resolution.
Person X has the right to subjectively recognize that he/she is happy?
(Rights? have? put this aside for the moment).
What others consider person X to be unhappy is
Infringement?
create conflict
If we define happiness as "having A
If you don't have one, I challenge you to define it.

Here's an abstraction.
Belief that "I define happiness."
What seems like a good idea to do so, certainty
Each person who has it has a different form of happiness, but
People who don't have it try to conform themselves to the "form of happiness" that others have decided for them.
Mismatched areas cause pain.
This seems to me to be a personal misfortune, but this should not be defined as misfortune as well.

remarks
Happiness due to any "having" brings unhappiness due to "losing".

### 1: View the whole thing
- Throughout, it is suggested that each person has different things and defines his or her own happiness based on them, but that there is a danger in setting one's own standards of happiness for others, and that the happiness of "having" can lead to the unhappiness of "losing".

### 2: Tell me your impression in one line
- The importance of defining happiness as subjective and not judging it by someone else's standards.

### 3: Interpret paragraph by paragraph
.

- 1st paragraph:.
    - We all have different things. It is fine to feel happy with what you have. However, we should not judge those who do not have it as unhappy.

- Second paragraph:.
    - The term "right to the pursuit of happiness" is not well resolved. Each person has the right to feel happy, but to judge others as unhappy creates problems.

- Third paragraph:.
    - The definition of happiness is personal, and those who have it feel different forms of happiness. However, those who do not have that definition try to conform to the standards of others and may feel pain.

- Remarks: 1.
    - [[Happiness based on possession brings unhappiness from losing it]].
