title: "The mindset to create something new cannot be educated."
---

from  [[Diary 2024-08-26]]
People [[who do new things]] basically prefer [[to go on their own]] in [[Forest without Rails]] rather than [[to go on the rails]] created by [[existing values]].
So even if there were "[[useful values]]," it would be hard to get in if an older authority taught that these are useful values.
- You have to talk to older people who are closer to your age, or you have to discover it yourself.
    - I thought this as I watched the LT by an alumnus of Unexplored Jr.
    - We've been talking about [[Minimum Viable Product]] or [[Eariest Testable Product]] from the beginning, but it hasn't stuck.
    - After experiencing the fact that the user test was not completed by the deadline, it makes sense to see a presentation by an alumnus who is close to your age.
- I've seen some negativity about "[[entrepreneurship education]]," and that seems to be related to this.
    - I can educate you on taxation, procurement and other know-how,
    - You can't teach the fundamental "[[entrepreneurial mindset]]" thing.
    - Teaching may seem like reproduction, but it's only a superficial imitation.

The [[mindset to create something new]] [[cannot be educated]].
- [You can't teach [[the mindset of creating something new]].

relevance
    - [[Innovation cannot be planned, but people who are likely to generate innovation can be nurtured.]]
    - > Let the pompous people discover the pompous people, and cluster them together. Then innovation will happen on its own through mutual inspiration and cross-fertilization.
- [[Collecting to increase opportunities for interaction]].
    - [[gather]] [[interaction]] [[increase opportunities]].
        - [[Pointy people gather!]] → gather and expect a reaction
