title: "Combination of procrastination and perfectionism"
---

>  When the [[procrastination]] habit is combined with [[perfectionism (psychology)]], "the incentive to procrastinate is strengthened by the prospect of suffering from the inability to perfect the task, and the perfectionist tendency is reinforced by the procrastination to finish the task even when it is started. This tends to create a hell in which nothing remains while the task is suffered terribly.
