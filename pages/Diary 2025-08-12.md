Ark UI using Chakra UI v3 causes problems

Ark UI is the headless UI library underlying ChakraUI v3.
What is Ark UI?
- Headless component library - provides only unstyled functionality
- Focus on accessibility - WAI-ARIA compliant implementation
- Multiple framework support - React, Vue, Solid supported
- New basis for Chakra UI - moving from v3 to Ark UI base
Why is the error occurring?
1. compatibility issues - SSR/RSC compatibility issues with Ark UI and Next.js
- Type definition error - fieldAnatomy.extendWith is not a function is an internal API inconsistency
3. build time issue - client-specific code is executed during server-side rendering


Chakra UI v2 should do it, Claude says the component names are about the same, so I changed them, and now I need to rewrite quite a bit.
- That's a big lie!

Well, it worked.
