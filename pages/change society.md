On "Changing Society."
- There are people trying to change [[what they can't control]].
    - [[Focus on what you can control.]] Some people

There are cases where both are useful in each.

Those who try to change what they can't control "[[speak up]]."
- Visualize by raising your voice that there is a [[Problem to be solved]] out there.
- If this visualization conveys [[awareness of the issues]] to "those who can control it," it will be resolved.
- It's possible that the "controllables" never existed in the first place.
- Some people are foolish enough to see the success of this approach and repeat the same approach even when it is unlikely to succeed.
- In some cases, success [[in attracting attention]] can result in a lot of negative reactions.
    - [[food thrown on artwork]]
