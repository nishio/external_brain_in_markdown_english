- As with exercise or learning a new language, intentional daily practice is required to realize the productivity benefits of Copilot
- Those who start the habit early will see greater benefits.
- It is important to view Copilot as a highly capable assistant, not a search engine, and to use it well.
- You also have to be able to decide whether to leave the task to the AI or handle it yourself.
- Leaders are expected to support their members to make the most of the time saved by Copilot

The message is that Copilot is not just a tool, but a partner, and that it is important to create a habit of using it in our daily work. It seems that the key to maximizing the effects of Copilot is to be aware of and work on it as an organization.
