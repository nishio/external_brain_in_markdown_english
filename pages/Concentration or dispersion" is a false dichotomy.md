Concentration or decentralization" is a false dichotomy.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1781732249928601784) The reason for long-term diversification of financial assets with index stock investments is that stocks have a positive expected value, but individually they can be negative, but if you invest 10 times the expected value The basic premise is that a 10-fold investment will result in a 10-fold increase in expected value. You can buy 10 times more homogeneous goods in the market because there is a large amount of homogeneous goods in the market. This is not the case with human and social capital.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1781757705235100031) The dichotomy of "concentration or diversification" implicitly assumes that it is a choice, but the nature of capital is so different that that assumption does not hold! It is not. Using the analogy of a stock index is like trying to write Haskell with Java ideas, there's a sense of "it's absurd to try to map that"!
