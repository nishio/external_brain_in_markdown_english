title: "Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past"
---

- Pattern of [[way of thinking]], "something similar was done in the past, it didn't work, so this won't work either."
- Comparing the old one A with the new one B, they are not exactly the same but have various differences.
    - The surrounding [[circumstances]] are different depending on the time of appearance, no matter how similar they are.
- Ignoring those differences and [[classifying with]] past failures is [[overgeneralization]].

- While this may save resources, there is a significant disadvantage of killing [[innovation]].
