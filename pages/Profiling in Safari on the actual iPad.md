title: "Profiling in Safari on the actual iPad"
---

I usually use Chrome. I needed to check the performance on the actual device, so I wired it to Safari on my iPad.
Recording" in "Timeline" is the same as "Record" in "Performance" in Chrome.
I was confused as to where I could see the sampling profiler output.
Select "JavaScript and Events" to see the equivalent of Chrome's "Event Log.

Is there an equivalent to Chrome's "BottomUp"?
