> Nick Rand, the "dark" frontier of thought.
> A dark new current of thought, known as the "New Reactionism" or the "Dark Enlightenment," which challenges liberal values, has been making its presence felt in our time, both in the shadows and in the open. In this book, three important figures approach its elusive core: Peter Thiel, Curtis Yarvin, and Nick Rand. In particular, it is the further intention of this book to delve into the thought of the philosopher Rand. The sphere of influence of Rand and his research group [[CCRU]] ranges from recent trends in thought such as "[[Accelerationism]]" and "[[Thoughtful Realism]]" to cultural players in diverse fields and cultural phenomena such as "[[vaporwave]]. Only by looking at "dark" thought will we be able to see what we are looking for.
