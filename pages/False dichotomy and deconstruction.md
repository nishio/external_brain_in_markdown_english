    - I myself don't recognize it with the label "[deconstruction (as in the term coined by Jacques Derrida)" (although there seems to be some commonality).
    - I think you recognize that "false dichotomies often appear in the various thoughts of various people" rather than "false dichotomies exist in existing philosophical theories."
        - Of course, philosophical theories of past philosophers are instances of "various thoughts of various people," so there is no contradiction.
    - I see, it's just part of the process of "deconstruction"...?<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/blu3mo/icon' alt='/villagepump/blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Deconstruction of Derrida in the narrow and original sense of the word "deconstruction:"
        - > The tendency to establish some kind of absolute truth and the opposite tendency to deconstruct absolute truth in the same author's text. Also called [[deconstructive reading]].
        - If you use it in the sense of "I don't know what I'm doing," then it has nothing to do with what I'm doing.
    - If we use the word "deconstruction" in the sense used by various people after Derrida, I can't say yes or no because at this point I don't feel the word is clearly defined (I'm getting a hint of a buzzword that tries to solve everything with the blockchain).
        - I think we have some common atmosphere.
