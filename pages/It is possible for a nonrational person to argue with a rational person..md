title: "It is possible for a nonrational person to argue with a rational person."
---

>  [[reasonable]] has an uncle who smugly tells you in the style of a businessman who can do his job that you can make money if you lose a game at home on purpose. Rationally, he doesn't know that the risk of being found out to have lost on purpose is greater than the return to be gained by losing on purpose. Don't be fooled because there are many rational businessman-looking people in the world, but they are actually not that rational. Scenarios like this are common in the business world where you might want to [[metacognition]] if you think you are making rational decisions. However, when you are really reading all the way to the back of the line, you should not be open about what you are reading, because you will not like it, lol. So it is very reasonable for Steve Jobs, the god of marketing, to say [[stay foolish]]. In other words, those who say that people who are not rational are foolish are not truly rational. And if one can argue on a merely rational level as described above, it is possible to render a truly rational person meaningless, and it is possible for a nonrational person to [[debunk]] a rational person. It is very reasonable for people who think they are not rational to accumulate such training. It is sad to say, but human beings are the life of self-defeating pleasure.

> An unreasonable person can argue with a reasonable person.
- interesting
    - That's why [[an "argument" cannot be a measure of rationality]].
- Also interesting is "[[t]]he [[merely rational]]."
