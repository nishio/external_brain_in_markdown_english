title: "We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI"
---

In the 2021 conversation "[Is machine learning a swing back to the equipment industry? This [[capital investment]] may be the [[barriers to entry]] (Moat) that prevent small and medium-sized businesses from entering the market.
This is the hypothesis from the perspective within the large operators that they can maintain their market dominance by keeping their technology secret.
However, as of May 2023, the leak of [[LlaMa]] and the emergence of [[LoRA]], a low-cost improvement method, threaten Google's dominance, and OpenAI is no different, the story goes.

> Why We Could Have Seen It Coming
>  In many ways, this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. The current renaissance in open source LLMs comes hot on the heels of a renaissance in image generation. The similarities are not lost on the community, with many calling this the “[[Stable Diffusion moment]]” for LLMs.
- [[Stable Diffusion]]

>  In both cases, low-cost public involvement was enabled by a vastly cheaper mechanism for fine tuning called low rank adaptation, or [[LoRA]], combined with a significant breakthrough in scale ([[latent diffusion]] for image synthesis, [[Chinchilla]] for LLMs). In both cases, access to a sufficiently high-quality model kicked off a flurry of ideas and iteration from individuals and institutions around the world. In both cases, this quickly outpaced the large players.
- [[latent diffusion]] = [[latent diffusion model]]
- Chinchilla
    - [[Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models]]


> The legal cover afforded by “personal use” and the impracticality of prosecuting individuals means that individuals are getting access to these technologies while they are hot.
- The impracticality of prosecuting an individual... that's the key.


Timeline
> The Timeline
>  Feb 24, 2023 - [[LLaMA]] is Launched
>  Meta launches LLaMA, open sourcing the code, but not the weights. At this point, LLaMA is not instruction or conversation tuned. Like many current models, it is a relatively small model (available at 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters) that has been trained for a relatively large amount of time, and is therefore quite capable relative to its size.
>
>  March 3, 2023 - The Inevitable Happens
>  Within a week, LLaMA is leaked to the public. The impact on the community cannot be overstated. Existing licenses prevent it from being used for commercial purposes, but suddenly anyone is able to experiment. From this point forward, innovations come hard and fast.
- LLaMA was leaked.
    - [[openness]] advances [technium (Tc)

>  March 12, 2023 - Language models on a Toaster
>  A little over a week later, Artem Andreenko gets the model working on a Raspberry Pi. At this point the model runs too slowly to be practical because the weights must be paged in and out of memory. Nonetheless, this sets the stage for an onslaught of minification efforts.
>
>  March 13, 2023 - Fine Tuning on a Laptop
>  The next day, Stanford releases Alpaca, which adds instruction tuning to LLaMA. More important than the actual weights, however, was Eric Wang’s alpaca-lora repo, which used low rank fine-tuning to do this training “within hours on a single RTX 4090”.
>
>  Suddenly, anyone could fine-tune the model to do anything, kicking off a race to the bottom on low-budget fine-tuning projects. Papers proudly describe their total spend of a few hundred dollars. What’s more, the low rank updates can be distributed easily and separately from the original weights, making them independent of the original license from Meta. Anyone can share and apply them.
>
>  March 18, 2023 - Now It’s Fast
>  Georgi Gerganov uses 4 bit quantization to run LLaMA on a MacBook CPU. It is the first “no GPU” solution that is fast enough to be practical.
>
>  March 19, 2023 - A 13B model achieves “parity” with Bard
>  The next day, a cross-university collaboration releases Vicuna, and uses GPT-4-powered eval to provide qualitative comparisons of model outputs. While the evaluation method is suspect, the model is materially better than earlier variants. Training Cost: $300.
>
>  Notably, they were able to use data from ChatGPT while circumventing restrictions on its API - They simply sampled examples of “impressive” ChatGPT dialogue posted on sites like ShareGPT.
>
>  March 25, 2023 - Choose Your Own Model
>  Nomic creates GPT4All, which is both a model and, more importantly, an ecosystem. For the first time, we see models (including Vicuna) being gathered together in one place. Training Cost: $100.
>
>  March 28, 2023 - Open Source GPT-3
>  [[Cerebras]] (not to be confused with our own Cerebra) trains the GPT-3 architecture using the optimal compute schedule implied by Chinchilla, and the optimal scaling implied by μ-parameterization. This outperforms existing GPT-3 clones by a wide margin, and represents the first confirmed use of μ-parameterization “in the wild”. These models are trained from scratch, meaning the community is no longer dependent on LLaMA.
- [[Cerebras]] no longer depends on LLaMa's leakage model

>  March 28, 2023 - Multimodal Training in One Hour
>  Using a novel [[Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning]] (PEFT) technique, LLaMA-Adapter introduces instruction tuning and multimodality in one hour of training. Impressively, they do so with just 1.2M learnable parameters. The model achieves a new SOTA on multimodal ScienceQA.
>
>  April 3, 2023 - Real Humans Can’t Tell the Difference Between a 13B Open Model and ChatGPT
>  Berkeley launches Koala, a dialogue model trained entirely using freely available data.
>
>  They take the crucial step of measuring real human preferences between their model and ChatGPT. While ChatGPT still holds a slight edge, more than 50% of the time users either prefer Koala or have no preference. Training Cost: $100.
>
>  April 15, 2023 - Open Source RLHF at ChatGPT Levels
>  Open Assistant launches a model and, more importantly, a dataset for Alignment via RLHF. Their model is close (48.3% vs. 51.7%) to ChatGPT in terms of human preference. In addition to LLaMA, they show that this dataset can be applied to Pythia-12B, giving people the option to use a fully open stack to run the model. Moreover, because the dataset is publicly available, it takes RLHF from unachievable to cheap and easy for small experimenters.
