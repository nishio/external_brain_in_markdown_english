This site is [[NISHIO Hirokazu]]'s [[Scrapbox]].
- For more detail: read [[What is this?]].

This project [/nishio-en](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en) is auto-translated from [/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio) written in Japanese. I reviewed some pages but not all, due to there're 10000+ pages.

If you find something interesting, feel free to tell me on [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nishio.bsky.social)
I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.

You can also read my book "[Engineer's way of creating knowledge](https://mem.nhiro.org/Engineer's_way_of_creating_knowledge)", which is translated by myself. The site is a mirror to allow book-like navigation and google translation.
