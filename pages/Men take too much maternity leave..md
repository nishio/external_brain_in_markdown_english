> "What do you think about [[men taking maternity leave]]?"
>  asked, "Men [[childcare leave]] too much!" I replied.
>  ？？？？
>  You take too much time off from childcare and do too much for the company.
>  That doesn't sound right, does it?
>  (Okuda heats up even more)
>  By nature, every human being has to carry the next generation.
>  [[Raising Your Own Children]]
>  [[Supporting the Children of Society]].
>  [[Fostering the Next Generation]].
>  All of us have to carry one of those things, but many of us are doing none of them.
>  Let's at least try to raise children close to us.
>  (Okuda heats up even more)
>  Childcare, child rearing, and nurturing the next generation,
>  No way, is there someone at the heart of the company who has done none of these things?
>  That's ridiculous!
>  The response to the maternity leave story proceeds with the conversation of.
