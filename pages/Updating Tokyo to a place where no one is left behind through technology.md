1. create new industries such as AI-related industries and raise income levels
2. creating a safe and secure Tokyo using cutting-edge technology in areas such as disaster prevention, medical care, and cyber security
- Realization of the world's best child-rearing and education environment through the use of technology
4. simplification and transparency of administrative procedures through digitization and streamlining of the metropolitan government
5. updating democracy using technology. Constantly listening to, visualizing, and reflecting the voices of the people of Tokyo in policy

Candidates have stated that they will publish details of their policies on the Internet on the 20th and prepare a way to use AI to interact with Tokyo residents and respond to their questions. They are also inviting people to share their opinions with the hashtag #TokyoAI and to create a forum to discuss the future together.
