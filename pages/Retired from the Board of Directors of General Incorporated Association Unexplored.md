> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1922128345287761959) I have decided to step down from the board of directors of the Unexplored Association. I have a good relationship with the association and will continue to cooperate with the activities of the Unexplored Association as I have in the past. From an engineering point of view, it is more straightforward by design to be loosely coupled. As for me personally, I intend to transmit more freely on social networking sites than I have in the past.

Right now, a group of people who want to join forces to make the world a better place is emerging, and that is Digital Democracy 2030!

We already have more than 100 volunteers who want to make Japan a better place as engineers, and we are happy to see the results of their efforts!

Also, since I am employed by Cybozu on a discretionary basis, I take time off during the daytime on weekdays to promote Team Mirai so that it is not treated as work.

- I have been appointed to the board of directors of [[General Incorporated Association Unexplored]].
