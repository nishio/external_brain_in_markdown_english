title: "We can all only be responsible for what we believe in"

> [hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/1783372435947147330) Suddenly, I'm starting an old story, but there was a time when I used to bite my superiors in anger, wondering why my excellent suggestions were not listened to and why other bonkers were valued more than me. I was in my thirties, I think. And I was hated in many ways. (→)
> [hazuma](https://twitter.com/hazuma/status/1783373196110303712) At the time I had no doubt that I was right and the world was wrong, but my views changed when I ran my own company in my 40s. It is true that my proposal at the time may have been right in isolation. But it is wrong to try to make it happen for others. Every person can only be responsible for what he or she believes in. (→)

But it is an important experience for them, and it is violent to intervene from the side and ask them to change. In that respect, I was violent in my 30s. That's why they hated me. I understand that now, but it may be difficult for younger people to understand. (→)

I just want to let you know that you will feel the same way as I do when you get older. If you want to work the way you want to work, you have to be alone. That's why I did it, but it's lonely and hard.

>  Once upon a time, from my point of view, the person in charge didn't seem to be doing well. So I told that person that I and everyone else think this part of you is not working. I told him, "I want you to improve. I told him that I and everyone else think this part of you is not good enough.

>  I remember that he told me, "Mr. Adachi, it's presumptuous of me to tell you that I want people to change and that if they change, things will go well.

>  Yes, because I don't know anything about what he's going through or what he's been through. I don't know why he is the way he is. I don't know why he is the way he is now, and I can't tell him to change tomorrow. But what is difficult is that, in business management, in the extreme, you want people to do what they believe in. How do you reconcile that?

>  So, in the end, management is about creating an organization...what is an organization, and how do I do it...it is about loving...you should read Fromm...so I started reading.
