[Talk about stop agitating HYPE and saying it's over when it's obvious to any researcher who reads the paper - Togetter](https://togetter.com/li/1798260)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This article summarizes researchers' reactions to Google's 2019 paper demonstrating quantum transcendence. The main points are as follows:.
- Google claimed that its 53-qubit [[quantum computer]] "[[Sycamore]]" performed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take 10,000 years on a supercomputer, but a Chinese research team later showed that a supercomputer could do it in 304 seconds.
- A manager of a quantum computer venture said, "I don't know what use a quantum computer will be," and "The naive trend of practical application has been broken in the last few years.
- Researchers have responded by saying, "We knew this was coming, we were always told it was going to be a 10+ year long battle," and "We were just dancing around [[the hype]].
- The majority of the participants are of the opinion that although it will take a long time to realize a quantum computer, steady progress is being made and research should be pursued calmly.
- Experts are skeptical of [[quantum transcendence]], with some criticizing it with phrases like "[[commercial physics]].

[Summary of reactions and explanations to the article "I'm not sure what's going on in the quantum computer industry in April '24" - Togetter](https://togetter.com/li/2352068)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The following exaggerations and misunderstandings have been pointed out by quantum computer experts in response to the claims of the author of the article, a venture capitalist.
- You misread the Harvard team's results as "realization of [[FTQC]]". In reality, error detection is performed but not correction, and only some gate operations are implemented.
- You are confusing the achievement of the 2030 MS goal with the realization of error correction in 2023.
- Since this achievement is by a leading quantum computer developer, it is logically incorrect to say that it is "different from existing developers".
- The [[neutral atom]] method is said to be "totally different" and "advantageous to FTQC," but this is an exaggeration and is only one of the leading methods.
- The key words of the results are arranged in a way that misleads the audience into thinking that FTQC has been achieved.
- By using words like "breakthrough" and "reset" to describe a little progress, quantum computers are overestimated.
