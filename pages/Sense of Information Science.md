It says, "When I look at these things, I see that informatics has quite a lot to contribute, but it takes an overwhelming sense of style." I have received a comment that "I am not sure what you mean. What does this mean?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>The comment, "Information science can contribute to many fields, but it requires an overwhelming sense," indicates that one must not only know tools and methods, but also "[[intuition]]" and "[[insight]]" as to which methods to apply to what data and how to interpret and utilize the results. In other words, it means that without [[deep understanding]] and sense that go beyond technical skills, it is difficult to derive intrinsic value from informatics methods.

Specifically, it is not enough to use advanced methods such as data analysis and dimensionality reduction,
- What preprocessing should be done (e.g., dealing with missing values, selection of dimensionality reduction methods)
- How to interpret the visualization and clustering results obtained (e.g., "Why did the dense clumps form?" and "What phenomena do they actually reflect?")
- Flexible decisions to change parameters and methods based on data characteristics (e.g., whether to use DBSCAN or UMAP, how to handle text embedding)
- Ability to rethink abstract issues such as "separate/not separate clusters," and to rediscover the axis of conflict and relationships
This means that "[[skillful]] judgment" and "[[originality]] in interpretation" are required. This refers to the need for accurate discernment and ideas throughout the entire analysis, not simply the application of algorithms.

Originality in interpretation" refers to the ability to go beyond the standard interpretation of how data looks on the surface and the methods used, to discover the latent structures, factors, and contextual implications behind the data from one's own perspective, and to make discoveries and gain understanding that cannot be obtained from conventional approaches. Rather than simply laying out the results, the ability to think and flexibility in thinking is required to grasp new angles on why things happened the way they did and how they actually relate to society and real-world problems.
