title: "avoid the basics"
---

- The basics are an appropriate first step for many people.
- Since it is feasible for "many people," it could also be interpreted as "anyone can do it."
- Some sort of pride thing makes them feel that it's lame to do something that anyone else can do.
- As a result of avoiding tacky things, the first step becomes too heavy and you can't move on.

Example
- Studying for exams, avoiding simple repetitive training and working only on difficult problems that are cool to solve.
- In learning entrepreneurial skills, avoid the naive "product sales model" and try to do the more difficult model.
