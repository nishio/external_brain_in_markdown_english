title: "They don't want to face the decline, so they water it down."

They don't want to face the decline, so they water it down.

Comparing 20s and 40s, 40s are physically inferior to 20s.

Most people don't want to face that "[[decline]]," so they try to make themselves look bigger by [[padding]] with what they've gained in the past.
- What I have gained in the past is "[[knowledge]]", "[[track record]]", "[[human relations]]", "[[social position]]", etc.
- (People who don't have anything to use for padding try to use "[[age]] being on top.")

However, this "[[desire to use]] what one has gained in the past" becomes a [[chain]] that keeps one in "the realm where it can be used."
- Unconsciously, we try to stay in the area where we can stand in a favorable position due to our past accumulation.
- It discourages exploration of new areas that did not exist in the past.
    - [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]]

It is inefficient to get caught up in these [[fetters]], so we must consciously suppress the desire to "use the past
- This is not "don't use the past."
- Difference in order
    - If you decide first to use the past and then choose an area, you can't explore it.
    - First, choose an area and explore it, and if you find an opportunity to demonstrate the value of using something from the past as a result, then use it.
