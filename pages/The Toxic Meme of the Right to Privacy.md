## Adult Public
.

The monument that stands in the center of the square is inscribed with a sentence from a past narrative.

> "Homo sapiens during this period were infected with the [[harmful meme]] of [[privacy]] rights."

No wonder," my grandmother shrugged. "That's when there was a spate of family murders because they couldn't see the CO levels in their neighbors' houses. It was polite to hide it."

Today is my ### adult reveal
. The lifeband on my wrist is unsealed and my breathing, sleep, mobility, purchasing, and neighborhood impact values are connected to my community.
Public disclosure is not punishment. It's [[visibility of responsibility]]. I alone have no right to cover up an area where my condition is directly related to the risk of others - that is our common sense.

Before the ritual, I am reminded of the recorded images I saw at school.
During the period of infection spread, contact networks were disrupted by walls of anonymity and cryptography, and exponential functions sprouted from the holes in tracking. Logistical delays were masked by trade secrets, and dialysis drugs disappeared city by city.
Once the open standards were implemented, the local mortality rate dropped 42% and the average arrival time for emergency services was 7 minutes shorter. This is because everyone can now see cause and effect and share [[counterfactuals]].

But what about [[shame]] or [[weakness]]?" I asked him once when I was very young.
My grandmother laughed and flicked her finger at the lifeband. Shame isn't protected by secrecy," she said. It is protected by context. We "only open our sphere of influence. Drafts of letters and unspoken feelings go into delayed disclosure until the impact is determined. The unsettled inner life is protected. But exhaust fumes, infection signs, money flows, and decision logs hit others. So make them visible."

A screen in the plaza shows old discussions.
Slogan: "Personal information is personal." Applause.
My grandmother tilted her head. The word "stuff" is a bad word. [External diseconomies are not things. It's a common good, like air.

The presiding officer signals and my public profile lights up.
A steady heartbeat, a lack of sleep last night, tomorrow's commute time, peak hours of electricity use - the community controller receives my data and begins fine-tuning the optimization.
A billboard at the end of the street glows faintly, the routing shifts a few inches, and the traffic jam disappears. The bakery across the street moves up its baking timing, and baguettes that were scheduled to be discarded are reduced to zero.
Seeing is a normal mechanism that helps someone.

At the end of the ceremony, I read the oath of office.

> I share without delay the areas where my condition affects others.
> I am part of a community that measures, compensates, and returns the impact of others.
> I respect the silence that matures the undetermined interior, but I do not hide the determined externality.

Applause breaks out. My grandmother adds in a whisper. You are now a protector. [The freedom to protect is much greater than the freedom to hide.

I nod.
A sentence from the inscription no longer falls on the chest as a mockery but as a historical term.
People in that era did not know [[the danger of missing out]], not malice.
We know. So we show it.
That is the norm, in this day and age.
