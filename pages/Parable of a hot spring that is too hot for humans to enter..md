title: "Parable of a hot spring that is too hot for humans to enter."
---

- [[idea]] Metaphor with respect to.
- Like a hot spring that is too hot for humans to enter, an idea may not be beneficial to the majority of people at the moment as it is.
- Over time, the "hot springs will cool down" and people will be able to enter.
- Water can be added to lower the temperature, but it will dilute the hot spring ingredients.
- By taking the time and effort to "fir the hot water," the temperature can be made suitable for humans without diluting it.
- Only employees have access to "[[source]]" that has not been "turned down in temperature" to get it out into the world.

Osborn, the proponent of brainstorming, used to compare ideas to [[boiling water]], but it is uniquely Japanese to relate it to hot spring water.

I laughed so hard when I saw the minutes.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon' alt='/villagepump/mtane0412.icon' height="19.5"/>
- I wonder if the reason there are so many [[posthumously acclaimed geniuses]] is because they need time for the temperature to cool down...
    - Great insight, metaphor further developed.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - > This is an illustration of "Yumomi," or stirring hot water with a board, which is done at Kusatsu Onsen.

- Mixing with a board lowers only the temperature without diluting the hot spring ingredients.
    - > Most of the hot springs in Kusatsu Onsen are hot, almost 50 degrees Celsius, and cannot be bathed in as is. However, if water is added to the hot spring to lower the temperature, the effects of the hot spring water will be diluted. Therefore, the "yumomi" method was devised, in which a board approximately 180 cm long is placed in the hot spring water and the hot water is firmer to lower the temperature to a certain level before it can be bathed in. In addition to lowering the temperature, "yumomi" also softens the water and serves as a preparatory exercise before taking a bath.

    - I interpreted lowering the temperature as "adding water", but they're doing their best to lower the temperature without adding water.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - You mean, "It's possible to easily lower the temperature by adding water, but that would dilute it, so you'd have to take the time and effort to "[[rub]] it in"?

- A source that is too hot for humans to enter.
    - It's not that the idea is bad, it's just too hot, and people can't get in now without cooling it down a bit.
    - It's outrageous that you don't appreciate this idea!" but "I see, it's too hot!" seems to be good for mental health.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/yosider/icon' alt='/villagepump/yosider.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - I had zero hot awareness...<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Hot water itself feels "cold around it".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
