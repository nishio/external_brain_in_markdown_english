- Amber organizations are what [[Lareau's color model]] calls "strict [[hierarchical organizations]] that prioritize [[stability]] and [[order]].
- The system operates according to fixed [[roles]] and [[rules]], with [[conveying the will of the governing to the governed]] and [[seniority]] and [[loyalty]].
    - Typical examples are [[bureaucracy]] and [[military]], which are strong in [[reproducibility]] and [[control]], but slow in [[adaptation]] to environmental changes.
