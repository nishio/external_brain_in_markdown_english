title: "Command and control in a non-pyramidal organization"
---

- commanding power]" has been considered a necessary force for [[Management]].
- It was the power to maintain a [pyramid-style organization
- On the other hand, some organizations are moving forward with [[de-pyramiding]], such as eliminating managers
- In such an organization, people are no longer controlled by [[extrinsic motivation]] called [[order]].
- It is good for each one of us to act on [[intrinsic motivation]].
- Because [[performance]] is higher when [[spontaneous]] actions are based on intrinsic motivation.
- What does "command and control" turn into in such an organization?
- Is not the power to enhance [[alignment]] in the direction of spontaneous action
- What it is in today's terms
    - I think it might be [[influence]] and [[persuasive power]].
- By communicating a compelling [[vision]], people around you are influenced by it.
- The result is spontaneous, close directional behavior.
