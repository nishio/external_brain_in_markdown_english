Improved explanation of eliminate things you do not understand
- [[(4.4.2.3) Read to eliminate things what you do not understand]]
    - > the goal is to eliminate things you do not understand
    - the word "eliminate" was not good choice
    - There are two phases of reading
        - clarify what you do not understand
        - eliminate/solve/destroy/understand what you do not understand
