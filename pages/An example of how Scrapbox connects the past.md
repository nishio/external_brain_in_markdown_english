    - [[useless]] write (2019-07-03)
    - When a person says that a method is "useless," it is sometimes due to a lack of ability on his/her part.
- Think about it, "It's the same when you say to another person, 'You're a poor communicator.'"
- I think I've written about this before, I'll search but can't find it.
    - Make [poor communication skills
- I'll search for the word "commie" as I come up with it.
- Unexpected hits: [[Selfish is an attribute of directed edges]] (2018-01-06)
- I realize that the "vertex attributes or edge attributes" perspective discussed here is the common composition of all three examples.
- This should be on a separate page.
    - Create [Vertex attributes or edge attributes?
- Found [[Attributes of relationships rather than single attributes]] (2019-01-24) in link suggestions by "attributes"
    - Jigsaw puzzle, not scalar], written on the same day, has little to do with the content of this issue.
        - I'm a little short on words when I reread it in light of "vertex attributes or edge attributes," and "single attributes or relationship attributes."
        - No written description of scalar-like growth.
