title: "Adult like a cold middle schooler."

> [3askin1obbins](https://x.com/3askin1obbins/status/1951938061140369897) I have a bird's-eye view of "painful things that people my age would do," based on the knowledge I have obtained from the Internet, and I think I am smart by repeating them. I thought I was smart by repeatedly [[having a bird's-eye view]] and [[laughing cynically]], but my mental age overtook me and I became a "cold, middle-school-like adult" before I knew it due to my lack of experience in real life.

Interesting observation
