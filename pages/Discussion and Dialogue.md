- It's funny how some people react to this like "that's not how debates work" or "that's arguing".
- I suppose there is no disagreement with the intent of "the left side is negative, let's change it to the right side."
    - There are good things about the left side!" This is not an assertion that "there are good points on the left side!
- They don't like the fact that it says "debate" in the top row on the left side.
- As a result, they are "attacking if there is a difference".
- Without going beyond "what I consider the [[meaning of the word]] 'debate,'" he argues that "the [[meaning]] of the word 'debate' is X. It is wrong to use it in the sense of Y."
    - The idea is that "my [[interpretation]] is absolutely correct," not that "there are many ways to interpret" in a relative sense.
- I can't change "I guess some people use 'debate' to mean 'Y.'"
- If this is the style of everyday conversation, I'm sure it would be "awkward" around that person.
- In other words, I know that the left side is negative, but I am acting on the left side.

digression
- The left side and the right side can be said to be "not/not relativized".
- This case is interesting in [[meta-]].
- There are countless people in the world who use words differently than you do.
    - What is the real benefit of arguing with one person you see and being able to match their word usage with your own?
    - In cases such as ongoing projects together in the future, it is beneficial to talk at length about language usage and the direction you are aiming for in the early stages to reduce the risk of future discrepancies.
    - What good does it do for people to argue about something they happen to see on the internet?
        - A sense of accomplishment that the battle was won?
    - It is a sterile activity and should be avoided.
    - What should we do when we see people doing such sterile activities without understanding that they are sterile?
        - "I guess some people are like that."?
