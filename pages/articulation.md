title: "articulation"

That language separates the world.

> Humans carve up the real world according to a "conceptual unit" called a "seigneura. And that carving is not universal. ...
> The speakers of each language arbitrarily choose which differences to distinguish and which to ignore... [[Saussure]] proposed [[linguistic relativity]] that "each national language has a mutually distinct and unique world image."
>  This act of arbitrarily creating a collection of lines is called segmentation.

2023-12-20 merged  [[segmentation]]
    - The concept of [[double division]] in [Saussure
    - Humans ignore some [[differences]] and focus on some differences
        - It thereby divides what could actually be a continuous value into several sets
            - Perhaps due to cognitive limitations.
            - In short, [vector quantization
        - This is [[articulation]], segmentation
    - phonological segment
        - e.g. [[I only focus on what I distinguish.]].
    - semantic segment
        - Carving up the world according to conceptual units
