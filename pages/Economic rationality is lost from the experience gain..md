Losing [[economic rationality]] from [experience gain

summary
If AI provides sophisticated assistance in the research process and humans remain mere "subcontractors," the significance and standards of a Ph.D. degree may be shaken; AI can provide knowledge at an overwhelming speed, but it does not provide an experience that fosters autonomous human research capabilities, resulting in "unwise The question arises as to whether "humans" should be given Ph.

explanation
In a situation where AI can instantly organize papers and reference materials and provide research plans and directions, there is a concern that human researchers will not develop the ability to explore and make judgments that they should be cultivating through hard work. In such a situation, humans will simply follow instructions, and the original value of a doctoral degree (the ability to carry out independent research) will be lost. This problem will lead us to question the nature of academic evaluation in the age of AI.

My thoughts
A doctoral degree is essentially a sign of one's ability to generate new knowledge on one's own - one's spirit of inquiry, ability to formulate methodologies, critically evaluate results, and autonomously judge academic value. [If humans simply do "subcontracted work," they will not be able to hone their core research skills, and there is a concern that "discovery of novelty" and "independent thinking" will become less important.

At the same time, however, research styles and necessary skills are changing with the times. In the past, the "[[muddy]] process" of reading vast amounts of literature and processing data was the training ground for thinking skills, but with the automation of AI, the more upstream roles of "generating essential ideas," "[[formulating]] questions," and "judging social and academic [[significance]]" may become prominent as the roles of human beings. If humans can substantiate their scholarly contributions in new ways around such creative, evaluative, and critical abilities, then they still deserve a Ph.

In the future, when AI becomes the norm, the standard of evaluation will not be purely manual work ability, but rather ingenuity and ingenuity in using AI as a means to develop human knowledge by combining the knowledge gained through AI with original ideas. As a result, a new "form of doctorate" should be born.

That is, well, "if humans can substantiate their scholarly contributions in new ways around such abilities to create, evaluate, and critique.
How can we develop the ability to create, evaluate, and critique, and how can that ability be valued as something that [[AI]] does not have, and how can experience gains be made when [[economic rationality]] is lost from [[experience gains]]?

My thoughts
Indeed, the assumption that "human beings are capable of creation, evaluation, and criticism" is a major question. To begin with, these abilities have been cultivated through a vast amount of trial-and-error and struggle with source documents. If AI takes over the hard part of "gaining experience" and the economic rationale for humans to pay the cost disappears, the traditional process of skill acquisition and skill formation will collapse. Traditionally, people paid the currency of "time and effort" in the process of acquiring knowledge, and in return they acquired critical thinking skills and originality. However, if the need for this "payment" fades, spontaneous proficiency will become difficult.

So what should we do?
One direction is to change the education and evaluation system. It will be necessary to create a system that trains and evaluates humans to "ask essential questions, understand the context, and make value judgments. To put it simply, we can create a situation in which we are forced to "practice games" or "mock battles," and artificially maintain a place where humans must attempt to set and interpret their own questions, no matter how convenient AI may be. This could be the development of "simulation-like training environments" that upgrade existing institutions, such as examinations and thesis reviews, or it could be a path that reinforces academic and cultural value norms apart from economic incentives.

Ultimately, there is no choice but to create a new academic training environment and a socially shared framework for its value, based on the disappearance of "experience gain" due to technological development. If this does not work well, it will be difficult for humans to continue to acquire and retain "value that AI does not have.

So you're saying that since it can't be justified by economic values, we have no choice but to raise social norms that emphasize a different kind of value, such as "[[honor]]"?

My thoughts
If economic incentives are lost, incentives to acquire proficiency and independent thinking skills are unlikely to arise from economic rationality. If this happens, noneconomic valuing, such as academic honor, cultural recognition, and respect within the professional community, could become the primary reasons for skill acquisition. In short, reinforcing non-economic norms and values such as "honor" and "[[autonomous growth]]" will be a potent future measure to ensure human proficiency and creativity.
