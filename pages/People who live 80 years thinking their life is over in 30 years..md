What do you mean by 'life is over in 30 years? It's not over. and those who physically end their life at the age of 30.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1819361469982752773) By the way, don't hang out with people from the "it's over" camp, but rather, "it's not over." Life is more enjoyable when you get together with people who are in the "it's over" camp, and while new and interesting things don't come out of the "it's over" camp, people in the "it's not over" camp suddenly start doing interesting things.
