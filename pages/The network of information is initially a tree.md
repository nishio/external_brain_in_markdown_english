    - When we say [[Information Network]], the word [[network]] tends to make us think of a form without branches and leaves, as shown in the figure on the left.
- But in reality, a tree with branches and leaves is closer to reality.
        - [[posterior]] and you realize, "Oh, this one and this one are related!" and connect them, they become "something that is not strictly a tree".
        - [[I notice the relationship after the fact, after I write it.]]
    - So is the process of creating [[mind-map]].
    - First, [[open sentence or paragraph]] in the form of "[[extend a branch]]" that makes a [[suggestion]] from the central theme.
    - Then add links between related branches to connect them.
- Scrapbox also does not have to try to create a network like the one on the left from the start.
    - If you put a link to one existing page on a newly used page, it can be connected to the "tree" as a "branch and leaf".
    - Then, two hops ahead are displayed, prompting the user to realize, "Oh, this has something to do with that! The network is then developed after the fact.
