title: "InfoSphere"
---

- A spherical space created by placing objects around it from a certain viewpoint
- I thought it would be more convenient to give it a name, so I decided to call it the Infosphere.
- At the center of the infosphere is the core.
- Core becomes [teleport target
- Information in the infosphere is tied to its core.
- If the core is moved, the information comes with it.
- If the core also serves as a teleport target,
    - Single click to teleport, long press to drag mode
    - The reverse is teleporting if your hand stops while dragging.

- The distance when the information slide is first placed in front of you is 20, so the radius is 40 in x2
- Default interval between infospheres should be 100
