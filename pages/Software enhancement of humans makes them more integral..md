When you design software by augmenting humans with software, the software becomes more [[integral]] than before

Is this correct?
On the other hand, advances in hardware make the cost of module seams easier to ignore.
This will put pressure in the direction of modularization.

Oh, so "modular or integral" is [[false dichotomy]].
- The interpretation of [[deep learning]] is to perform mechanical matching to a large integral system of modules of a weak learner.
