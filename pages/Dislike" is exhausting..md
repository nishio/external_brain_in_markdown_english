title: 'Dislike" is exhausting.'

> [finto__](https://twitter.com/finto__/status/1658463753116225538) I may have mentioned this before, but when I was in junior high school I had a [[dislike]] teacher for a long time, but one day I suddenly thought, "I'm tired of [[dislike]] him. I changed my mindset and suddenly it didn't matter anymore. Disliking" someone is a form of [[attachment]] that is different from "liking" someone, so it takes a lot of energy.

> [finto__](https://twitter.com/finto__/status/1658470179632979969) At the time, I probably had the perception that "disagreement = dislike", and I felt insecure unless I divided people into "like/dislike" or both. I guess I couldn't accept the gradation of liking some parts (that fit with me) and not others (that didn't fit with me), and I felt safe by putting them in the "dislike" box for now.

You start to look for the bad things about the person and you can no longer see them from a flat perspective. You start wasting energy in a cycle of reassurance. This is a terrible thing, and more than anything, a waste of energy!

> [finto__](https://twitter.com/finto__/status/1658479149223387148) Of course, there are many kinds of "dislike", and I understand that it's not just cases that can be easily divided like this, and I'm not forcing you to think this way. I don't want to force you to think this way, but I'm just saying that what you think is a gut feeling or a physiological reaction can be switched on surprisingly easily (and with a little conscious change).
