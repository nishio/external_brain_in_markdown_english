title: "Technology is neutral"

- [[technology]] is [[neutrality]] and can be used for [[good purpose]] or [bad purpose
- The [[knife]] can be used for cooking or for killing.

Something that has developed on a slightly different axis.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1652999873598472195?s=20): "Technology is neutral. That is, if a technology is beneficial to some people, then of course there are those who will be harmed by it."
- If there are some [[limited resources]], and someone's use of a technology increases the amount of that resource, then someone else's resource gain is reduced.
        - [[zero-sum game]]
        - [[A sucker is someone who doesn't know who is a sucker.]]
