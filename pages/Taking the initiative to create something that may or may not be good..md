title: "Taking the initiative to create something that may or may not be good."

> [ochyai](https://twitter.com/ochyai/status/1775167957251113105) Don't just make what you think is good. You should make something that you think is good, but that is a hindrance to challenge and experimentation. What is really important is to take the initiative in making something that you do not even know if it is good or not yet, something for which there is no way to judge.
