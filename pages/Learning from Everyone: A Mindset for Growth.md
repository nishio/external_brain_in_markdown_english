"Learning from everyone" is more of a mindset than a fact. By adopting the perspective that you can learn from every person and actively engaging in this activity, you can bring beneficial effects to your life.

To learn from everyone, it is essential to focus not on "what you have that others do not," but on "what others have that you do not." This requires training. In a default state, the difference between "knowledgeable people and less knowledgeable people" is clear in areas where you are knowledgeable, while in areas where you are not knowledgeable, this difference is unclear, leading to a bias that you are generally knowledgeable.

One solution is to take an interest in others' past experiences. Regarding their past experiences, the other person is the most knowledgeable in the world, and without learning from them, you know nothing. This structure is obvious, making it less likely to fall into bias.
