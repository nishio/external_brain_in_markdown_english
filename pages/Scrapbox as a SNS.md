title: "Scrapbox as a SNS"
---

I have been using Scrapbox for a long time as an "alternative to my personal [[Blog]]," but of course I have also used it as a "place for shared group communication" during that time.
With the recent addition of the [[External Links]] feature, there is a sense that we have entered a new stage. Networks are now generated between what were previously "individual chunks".
The dispersed communities that have emerged share some members and are connected by their interests, forming a [[network formation]] in a [[posterior]] manner. This is an interesting form of [[SNS]].
