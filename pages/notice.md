- When Facebook included a notification digest feature (reducing notifications on its own), people who used the feature thinking they could get through to others without explicit mentions fell into miscommunication.

- In Microsoft Teams, when you add someone else to a new channel and write there, the other person may not notice it because the channel is collapsed.
- Email is a very successful decentralized notification system, but because it is decentralized, each user's availability is uneven.
    - Cases where file attachments are rejected because they are over capacity
    - Software to send HTML emails v.s. Software to hide HTML emails
    - The question of whether or not to erase quotes from past emails.
    - Don't cut the thread." v.s. "What is a thread?"
