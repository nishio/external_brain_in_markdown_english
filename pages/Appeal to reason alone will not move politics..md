Appeal to reason alone will not move politics.

Classically in political theory, the dichotomy of reason versus emotion has been discussed. For example, Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Condorcet]] held that the ideal was "the formation of the general will by public reason" and that private feelings and sentiments should be eliminated. In the 20th century, however, the political phenomena of mass society ([[totalitarianism]], [[fascism]], etc.) made it clear that appeals to reason alone were not enough to sway politics. In her analysis of the rise of totalitarianism, [[Hannah Arendt.]] also points out that the emotional state of the masses, such as "[[solitude]]" and "[[anxiety]]," became the ground for [[blind faith in ideology]]. She emphasized the ability to use imagination and empathy and to "think from the standpoint of [[others]]" in political decisions ([[extended thinking]], the political exercise of [[sensus communis]]), which can also be said to be a matter of [[emotional intelligence]] in a broader sense.
