What did you do last week?
- The week before last
        - [[Omoikane Bot]], [[Agents living in Scrapbox.]] of [[Omoikane Project]], now digests the previous day's updates daily.
        - This was part of [/omoikane/working notes:Omoikane Embed into other projects
    - Then, an attempt was made to prepare for an internal study session with the support of GPT4
            - [[Preparation for Omoikane Study Group]]
            - [[Omoikane Study Group]]


- Last week saw further development of both.


Make Omoikane Embed work for other projects
I was originally going to put it in /nishio, but due to the complexity around caching, I was thinking of doing it first in a "small, public, collaborative editing project" where doing the whole thing without caching would not be too expensive.
- [/unnamed-project/chat page 9](https://scrapbox.io/unnamed-project/chat page 9).

8/7 Making Omoikane Embed work for other projects, it worked locally.



8/8 Memo
- from [/omoikane/working notes:Omoikane Embed into other projects#64d1d13caff09e000079c5a4](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/working notes:Omoikane Embed into other projects#64d1d13caff09e000079c5a4)
    - > Omoikane Embed worked on [/unnamed-project
        - > I'm just a simple summary bot like the one here now, but that's no fun, so I'm going to turn you into an agent to explore the Wiki.
        - > Since you have JSON and vector indexes in your local files, you can actively read and write Scrapbox as a tool.

8/9 Introduction guide: [[How to put /omoikane/Omoikane Embed into other projects]].
- unnamed-project: I tried to make the AI choose 4 randomly and comment on them.
    - I have four random "pages" picked out, but I prefer "chunks."
- from [/unnamed-project/🤖2023-08-09](https://scrapbox.io/unnamed-project/🤖2023-08-09)
    - > The question format is good for prompting comments.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamed-project/inajob/icon' alt='/unnamed-project/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - > How to cook after this...
        - > Let's just let it grow.

8/10  [[AI assists human convergence]]
- Now I'm picking four and asking questions, [[divergent moves]].
- If you can do a vector search, you can do a [[convergent move]].


Similarly, think about what the agent who puts in this project should do

Trying to make a language out of the undefined word "[[neri neri]]" as a tentative name.
    - [[Nodal Point of Thought 2023-08-08]]
- After several subsequent posts.
    - [[Kozaneba and the quest for "Neri Neri]]
- Still doesn't feel like a done deal.


I don't have the words to briefly recap this week.
    - [[Omoikane Study Group]] has yet to listen back to the oral conversation.

2023-08-18
- Things I've been meaning to write about but keep forgetting
    - Difference in location resolution
    - Bring it all with you and you'll be safe.
It's a low priority and I'm busy right now, so if I write it here, I'll be able to write it when I'm ready to settle down and switch up my weekly journal.
- Maybe the timing of the look back should be determined by human sense, not mechanically, for this kind of adjustment to take place.

Participation in [unexplored junior LLM camp

- [[A case study of a new combination with the assistance of AI]]
- [[diary2023-08-19#64df9ec4aff09e000036ad22]]
- We're getting close.
- I know it's time to switch up the weekly log, but we've got about 4 more days of camp rush, so...
