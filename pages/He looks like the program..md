Awww, that's funny, I'm the original and Keicho is the copy.

This story reminded me of Dr. Ishiguro, who made his robots look like him.
- Did you copy me and create a program, or am I mimicking the program's behavior?
- I thought it was the former, but it could be seen as an interacting system.

I can say that I am one step closer to my goal of creating an intellectual production system that will continue to be active after my death and produce some useful value (I want to create a copy of myself).
