- When you first build something, it may look crappy compared to what you can buy.
- But if you don't make it, you won't acquire the ability to make it.
- Looking at the aspect of variety and variation rather than quality, the range of "what you can make" expands as you acquire the ability to make it.

memo
- In the figure, all the red grains are circled in green, but it is more realistic to see how many were missed.
