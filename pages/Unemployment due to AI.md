title: "Unemployment due to AI"

> [yuiseki_](https://twitter.com/yuiseki_/status/1642143023248318464) If you put yourself in the manager's mind and think in terms of Japanese [[layoff restrictions]], unemployment due to AI is "I was suddenly fired! " I think it will start with "[[decrease in employment demand]]", i.e. "[[worsening of job market]]", and then it will start slowly like squeezing a cotton wool. And when [[employment demand]] declines, the entire economy shrinks and everyone becomes reluctant to work.
- > [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642198446403911683?s=20): [[middle management]] who [[retired early]] because they were told they could play a more active role if they changed jobs are looking for similar middle management jobs. But all those positions are [[competition with AI]], and you have to be at least "[[a person who can master AI]]" to even get to the starting line, but [[caregiving]] and the like are still [[shorthanded]].

- [[Kinta Nakayama]] also pointed out a long time ago that "in Japan, AI is not a form of firing people".
- The counter-action to declining job demand is the [[Universal Basic Income]] that [[Sam Altman]] is advocating.
- In the case of Japan, companies that can afford [[membership-based employment]] are likely to move to [[basic income within the company]], holding on to human resources that cannot be laid off.
    - [[job-based employment]] places lay off people, and places that can't afford it [[bankruptcy]] release their people.

Middle management will become even more unnecessary than it is now.
