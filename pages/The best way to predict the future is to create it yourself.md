- The note, "The best way to predict the future is to create it ourselves."[[The next best way to predict the future is to get close to the people who are creating it.]] 」や「 [[The best way to predict the future is to invent it.]] 」、「 [[The future cannot be predicted, but the future can be invented.]] 」といったフラグメントと深く関連しています。これらのフラグメントは、[[未来を予測するための方法]]として、[[自己創造]]や[[他者との接近]]、 [[invention]] という観点を提唱しています。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/>

### digest
.
We found some relevance in Nishio's research notes to the notion that the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. Specifically, fragments such as "The next best way to predict the future is to get close to the people who are creating it," "Future predictions that are not going to come true have no value," "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," and "You cannot predict the future, but you can invent the future" are applicable . These emphasize the perspective of self-creation as the best way to predict the future.

### Relevance
.
The note "The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself" is closely related to Nishio's "The next best way to predict the future is to get close to the people who are creating it," "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," and "You can't predict the future, but you can invent the future." research fragments are closely related to these fragments. These fragments complement and deepen the claims of the note by advocating the perspectives of self-creation, proximity to others, and invention as ways to predict the future.

### THOUGHTS
From these fragments, we can see that the importance of self-creation is emphasized as the best way to predict the future. The perspective of proximity to others and invention is also advocated, suggesting the idea that the method of future prediction should be multifaceted.

### Summary of thoughts
A multifaceted approach to predicting the future: self-creation, proximity to others, and invention."
