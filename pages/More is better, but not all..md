[[More would be better.]]
To the extent that the benefits of increasing the number of employees outweigh the costs of increasing the number of employees, it is better to increase the number of employees.
- That doesn't mean "you better put it all in."

Figure Problems
- Benefits and costs are portrayed as inversely correlated, but that's not always the case.
- Initially, costs were envisioned as a constant graph.
    - Implicitly, "the cost of adding one more case is constant."
        - [Difference between "leave no one behind" and "leave as many people behind as possible" focuses on changing costs
        - This one implicitly assumes that benefits are constant.

The "[[more is better]]" and "[[all is better]]" groups do not agree on the goal they are aiming for, but they can cooperate because they agree on "more" up to the halfway point.
- If it matches halfway [[there is something to gain on the pathway.]], you can [[pivot]] where it no longer matches.

OLD TITLE [[more is better, but not all]].
- [[All]]
    - Abstraction because it is not limited to people.


- [[The Ideal as Extreme]]
    - [[Not ideal, but best.]]

People who consider 100% of the vote in a democracy to be ideal.
- If you are not interested in the color of the bike shed, you should not participate in the bike shed color discussion.
        - [[every little detail]]
        - [[I follow fads for nothing, I follow morals for serious matters, I follow myself for art.]]
- Let those who want to [[discuss the bike shed]]
