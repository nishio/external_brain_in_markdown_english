- I noticed this when I had Claude put together a transcription of an English YouTube video and had him further explain in depth the parts of it that interested me.
    - [[How can we use technology to go past simple preferences and outcomes?]]
    - [[Digital Peacebuilding Expo: Talk to the City]]

"Look at [[the summary]] first, then dig into [[what interests you]]."

- [[delve into]]
- [[summary]]
