> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1827673433288978885) I was asked to re-login before submitting the changed Shinkansen ticketing code, and when I tried to log in, I was told to wait 3 minutes! I thought I was going to miss it, but I made it in time because the bullet train was delayed due to torrential rain. But the bullet train was delayed due to heavy rain, so I made it in time.
- I arrived at Shin-Osaka early, so I changed the ticket I had reserved with Smart EX to a train 10 minutes later.
- I don't know how to issue tickets, so I'll look that up and read it.
- When I try to submit the code, the session is expired and I'm asked to log in again.
- I don't have a picture of it then, but here's what it looked like

    - I was waiting 3 minutes to log in after the train left in 7 minutes.
    - There was a line at the vending machine for ticketing, but I was able to make it because the credit card required one was available.
    - Departure time at the point of entry
        - The bullet train itself was 5 minutes late, so it was safe.

>  "It was raining heavily in Osaka this morning, too, though it had stopped by the time I got up to go out."
>  "Kyoto Station is flooded by heavy rain" "Really? Thanks to you, I didn't miss my bullet train!"
>  Not even a drop wet. That's quite an evasive performance.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1827678389098123705) Kyoto Station Now "It's running very late, let the Nozomi coming later through first" What's going on, ugh!
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1827679011620917369) Kyoto station was in trouble.
>  >[aBub_Deadgo](https://x.com/aBub_Deadgo/status/1827660433815404769) You were right to cut it off early.
>  By the time I arrived at Kyoto station, the station was flooded with rain and lightning, the bullet train was stopped and full of people, and some of the local trains were also stopped.
