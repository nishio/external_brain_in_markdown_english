- Example: AI will make jobs disappear
- The assertion that "X disappears" is often made in the context of X's [[Low resolution]].
        - [[the subject is large]]
- This is what happens when you increase the resolution
    - Part A of X disappears
    - The rest of part B remains.
    - A new C is created.
- Put another way, X just [moves
        - [[Observation coverage issues]] but also
    - [[Objects moved out of the observation range become invisible]].
    - For those whose observation range stays in the old X range, X appears to disappear.
