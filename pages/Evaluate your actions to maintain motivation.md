title: "Evaluate your actions to maintain motivation"
---

From A: [[willingness (e.g. to do something)]] comes B: [[action]], from B comes C: [[results]], and from the evaluation of C comes A again, and so on in a cycle.
But there is [[uncertainty]] as to whether B leads to C.
An attitude that only allows C undermines A when C is not obtained due to uncertainty.
Even if the world only values C, you yourself must value B in order to maintain A.
When actions don't always lead to results, [[resultism]] can nip motivation in the bud.
