title: "Give X to those who ask for X"

Is it right or wrong to give pornography to those who seek it?

Pornography here is not a concept limited to sexuality.
- Broader meaning, like "[[inspirational porn]]."
- For example, "Japan is not in decline! Japan is still better than China!" How about providing a story to that effect for those who want to believe that "Japan is not in decline!
- How about a host offering a pseudo-love affair to a woman who is hungry to be loved?
- How about offering such a story to those who want to believe that "humanity is not losing to AI?"
