- The Mystery of Self-Causation: Humans are trapped in an extremely prideful concept of "[[self-causation]]" and are caught in an attempt to attribute complete responsibility for their own actions and choices.
- Misconception of freedom of the will: Many people are deeply entrenched in the concept of "[[freedom of the will]]" and are expected to have a complete sense of responsibility for their actions and choices. However, this is a misconception and an obstacle to understanding true freedom.
- Misuse of causality: In the real world, causality and necessity do not exist. Nevertheless, many people misuse these concepts by objectifying "cause" and "effect.
- The myth of the crippled will: the real issue is the strength or weakness of the will, and [[the crippled will]] is just a myth. This myth has a profound effect on people's sense of responsibility and self-esteem.
- Personal Responsibility: Some people accept responsibility for their actions and choices and refuse to pass it on to others. On the other hand, those who despise self are willing to pass that responsibility on to others.

CONCLUSION: People are so caught up in the concepts of "self-causation" and "freedom of will" that they have lost sight of their true sense of freedom and responsibility. By overcoming these misconceptions and myths, people will have a clearer and healthier sense of self and responsibility.
