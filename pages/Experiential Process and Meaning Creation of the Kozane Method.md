- There are [[Interior Exploration]] and [[External Exploration]] (Jiro Kawakita's term)

Internal exploration is the process of exploring one's inner self and creating verbalized fragments

External exploration is the process of exploring outside of yourself and creating verbalized fragments
- For example, interviewing multiple people on the same topic.
- Nishio considers reading books a form of external exploration.

In neither case are the fragments created in an organized order.
