Go ahead, hit the wall and turn.
- There's a difference of opinion between those who see this "[[run into a wall]] before" and those who see it "after" hitting the wall.

- Makes it easier to go in a certain direction.
- We're going in that direction.
- Proceed to touch [[constraints]] that are not currently affected
- change direction

For example, LLMs make programming easier.
- Programmers increase as barriers to entry are lowered and the customer value generated per person increases.
    - Because right now there are too many "problems to solve" and not enough programmers.
    - This "supply of problems to be solved" is the "constraint."
- If the number of programmers increases sufficiently, the "supply of problems to solve" will replace the bottleneck.
    - Before this timing, it was "we found a problem to solve, but we didn't have enough people to actually turn it into code, so we couldn't demonstrate much value.
        - As programmers begin to be in surplus, the value of "finding a problem to solve" rises as prices begin to fall.
    - Insufficient supply of problems will lead to a surplus of programmers.
        - More and more cuts are being made on the low-skilled side.

- After you hit the wall, the value of your ability to understand physical phenomena will jump, [[from a common sense point of view]].

- [[When one bottleneck is eliminated, another bottleneck arises.]]
    - [[bottleneck]]
