title: "Group Selection and Movement"
---

- Multiple slides can now be moved together.
- But [[Multi-slide highlighting]] is not yet available, so I'll have to run it to see which one is selected.
- There is a bug that leaves a highlight (red plate for) when a single selection is made.

    - [[KJ method]] Enforce the rule of "expressing group identity by placing them close together.
- That way, you don't have to select the group in the first place with a rectangular selection or a lasso tool.
    - Being a group = being placed in close proximity
    - The only thing left is how to set that threshold.
- The current method of designation is not very intuitive.
    - Simply the distance to the nearest slide at the start of the drag is the threshold.
    - Intuitively, I'd like to drag it closer.
