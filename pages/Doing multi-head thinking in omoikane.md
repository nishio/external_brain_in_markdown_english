Doing [[multi-head thinking]] in omoikane
Based on multi-head thinking
- Go beyond your personal Scrapbox
- Create a collaborative editing project that anyone can enter.
- Run pioneer mode with flow rate limitation.
    - Prevention of high volume processing and high billing
- Anyone can plant the seeds of exploration.
- Now omni is doing a vector search against my Scrapbox.
    - Extend this to everyone who has pickle
- It is tedious to always have the latest version, but I find the effect of digging up past thoughts beneficial, so there is no need for frequent updates if that is the case.
    - Excavation occurs due to the connections between those projects.
- Scrapbox as an external brain interconnects

- Why don't we just use "omoikane" instead of creating a new "collaborative editing project that anyone can enter"?
