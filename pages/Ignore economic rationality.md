title: "Ignore economic rationality"
---

- There are various cases where it is better to ignore [[economic rationality]] in creating something new.
- Think about [People who don't need to make money.
    - People who have accumulated sufficient retirement funds #Early Retirement
        - After [[basic income]] was introduced
- Make things because you want to make them without considering economic rationality.
    - But isn't it possible to create and be satisfied with that?
    - Cost of communicating to others what has been generated
    - Cost of adjusting to meet the needs of others
    - Isn't there an incentive to pay those costs?
- As a result, new things are created, but are they unlikely to develop into [[innovations]] that affect a large number of people?

discussion
- Most people don't make things for spontaneous motives in the first place.

    - > I don't think [[creative]] is compatible with a community where money is paid. So I think a society where BI is implemented will accelerate innovation.
- nishio
    - > I also think that the amount of new things created would increase if there were BI, but I am concerned that creators who are financially satisfied will create new things based on their own impulse to create, and then act "satisfied and throw them away and start creating something else.

    - > I think the pressure to connect with others is stronger than the pressure to connect with money.
- nishio
    - > I guess it depends on each person which pressure is stronger, but even if the pressure of "I have to make money" were to disappear, other pressures might just be created.
- kensuu
    - > I think that's why people who don't have to earn money until they die, like serial entrepreneurs like Shintaro Mercari, start their own businesses over and over again.
- nishio
    - > It is true that serial entrepreneurs work even when they don't have to. The desire to change society for the better may be free to flap their wings when they no longer have to earn a living to keep themselves alive.
