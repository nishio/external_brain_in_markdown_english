I have observed three people (including myself) who say "Claude 3 Opus is smarter, but I can't let go of GPT Builder" (P and Q), so I wanted to know if this is true for "everyone" or if it is a "discrepancy".

88% think "[[Claude 3 Opus]] is smarter"
On the other hand, among those who think they are smart, a small but small minority (41%) think they "can't let go of [[GPT Builder]]."
