I think I drew something like the diagram on the left recently, but I can't remember the keywords.
- There it is.
        - [[Concrete/abstract is a false dichotomy]]

- [[Abstraction is dimensionality reduction]] So there will be more than one.
    - [[Similarity of concepts is not distance.]]

- [[interpretation]]
- [[abstraction]]
- [[side]]
    - There are multiple [[Aspects of Experience]].

- [[When you draw a tree, you mistake one side for a single]]
