title: "I need a bigger wall."
---

- Metaphor to put information ([[tag]]) on the wall
    - It is useful to enhance [[listing]] by sorting information
    - This is the basic concept of the [[KJ method]] [[label sorting]].
    - But you can't carry around a physical wall with information pasted on it.
    - Limited wall space available.
- With [[VR]], you can "take the wall with you."
    - No need to clean up
    - Endless walls and desks boil over.
    - Usefulness as an Intellectual Productivity Tool
- The ability to use an infinite number of walls and desk surfaces is useful as an extension of the current system, but the benefit of increased freedom of viewpoint is significant.
        - [[KJ Method, Clean Space and Mind Palace]]
        - There are an infinite number of [[Big Walls]], and you can [[teleport]] from one wall to another just by clicking on a sticky note on the wall.
    - You can also stand at the location of the sticky note on the wall and look around. Related: [[Freedom from Physics]].
- The metaphor "[[wall]]" is very much tied to physical constraints.
    - Maybe a better metaphor for [[scuba diving]], where you can move around in three dimensions
    - Of course, if you don't dive deep and work only on the surface, you can use it just like a wall.
