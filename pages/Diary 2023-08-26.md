- [[üåÄSuccessful intelligence]]
- Human greatness cannot be demonstrated by individual wisdom. When the wisdom of people is fused together, it becomes sentient wisdom and brings to life the heavenly destiny. It is the collective wisdom that makes all things develop and demonstrates the heavenly destiny that creates human prosperity.
- The "Proposing a New View of Humanity" by Konosuke Matsushita was fused with the "Proposing a New View of Humanity" by Konosuke Matsushita, which is a statement that "Humanity is a new way of life.
- [[People's wisdom will be fused together]]!

- [[ü§ñ twist]]
- > AI improves its ability to organize information by reading "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production.
- That's hilarious.
    - Then I'll have them read it to you, W.

- [[ü§ñCan we apply Scrapbox's "connection discovery support" feature to support connection discovery between different contents?]]
- > Discover related keywords with shaky notation and different perspectives by doing an ambiguous search for existing keywords with the keywords you started writing about.
- ‚ÜíVector search against existing sentence fragments with sentence fragments that have been started to be written to obtain relevant descriptions of different points of view.
- > When you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is performed against the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, providing an opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking.
- ‚ÜíScrapbox projects that you have viewed are also searchable, providing you with the opportunity to discover other people's thoughts on what you are thinking about.
    - [Finding sides by abstracting one from the other.

- Merged main branches [[ü§ñ2023-08-25 07:09]] and [[ü§ñ2023-08-26 07:10]] into [üåÄDiscomfort-driven intellectual production
- The main branch does not contain skips of fragments that have been put in in the past, so the topic is always pulled back, even if an interesting topic grows out of it.
    - 8/28/2023 Named: [[page memory]].
- Main Branch, you want to try planting a diary?

- [[üåÄCollaboration with AI]]
- I felt like my output, which I am now doing in bullet points, should be Kozaneba-like.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/aa02e29aaeabe8088bd6ff4244602ff1/thumb/1000)
- I really hope this is a seamless connection.


- [[üåÄNishio Yasukazu]]
- It'll be interesting to see how it all rolls out, so I'll leave it alone.

- [[üåÄHuman-AI Boundaries]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/dac54a4ec071b4f87d3724cb67f41ae8/thumb/1000)
- Whether AI can support or replace human judgment depends on the level of human acceptance.

- [[üåÄ Intellectual Production]]
- [[productivity growth may lead to oversupply]].
- That's for sure.
- The supply was low, so the business model of producing them at cost and then copying and selling them was established.
- An oversupply makes those things worthless.
    - Is personalization in [[Uncopyable value]] important?
- Individual context-specific knowledge production
    - The value of context-free knowledge decreases, leaving only the value of producing knowledge that is tailored to the context of the individual.

When you want to trigger
- Now run on command line
- Can you do it from the web?
    - > Serverless functions will timeout after 10 seconds on Vercel's Hobby Tier and 60 seconds on Vercel's Pro tier. [Doc](https://vercel.com/guides/what-can-i-do-about-vercel-serverless-functions-timing-out)
    - This is going to be a problem and time out.
- Do you want to do it with Github Actions?

- [[Is this the end of the ü§ñ"public Scrapbox period"?]]
- plan
    - Create a private omni personal project
    - If AI and humans are to be equal, AI should be able to stretch and write on their own projects, not borrow from my projects and write with a "ü§ñ" or something like that.
    - Change the vector search that is now being done based on the project pickle to a query to Qdrant.
    - This makes it easier to search multiple projects, books and thesis abstracts, because you can control them by payload attributes.
