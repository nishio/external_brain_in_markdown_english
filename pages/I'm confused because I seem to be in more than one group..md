title: "I'm confused because I seem to be in more than one group."
---

from [[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]] Preliminary Questionnaire

Q: I'm confused because I feel like things can be looked at from many different sides and can categorize materials into multiple groups.

A: There is nothing wrong with that feeling.
Jiro Kawakita himself gives such an example in his association between islands of illustration.

- >  C is also like A and D, and in another sense like B and E. These double or triple lines of relationship are called [[crossed circles]].
    - [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]] p.136

For example, let's say you are struggling with the grouping phase before diagramming.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7e1ec337ae18cce4aa150195e5696a8a/thumb/1000)
- "C has a strong relationship with A, and a strong relationship with B, so which one should we stick with..."
- If there is a strong relationship between both, why not one group of three?

- Why did you consider "A and B are different groups"?
- Because A and B are not similar?
- For example, how about this case
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e2098e253713f18561866c498074e2b3/thumb/1000)
    - Front cover "Cylindrical columns look both circular and square."
        - Circles and squares are not similar, seemingly unrelated, but they are connected through the cylinder.
    - Are you unconsciously ignoring these patterns?
- Not necessarily "different groups because they don't look alike."
    - When you "collect things that seem to be related," do you implicitly define "related" as only "similar?"
    - I was curious about the use of the word "classification" in the question text. Classification is a narrower concept than KJ-method grouping, since classification is "to gather similar things together.

I think that there are cases where people have a chance to think once about whether the above cases apply to them and still say, "I still want a different group.
For example, a case like this
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/d78990c25b34c37e06b319000b5cace3/thumb/1000)
- E is closely connected to everyone in A-D, so I want him to be one of them, but he's also closely connected to everyone in F-I, so I want him to be one of them. If we put them all in one group, it would be too big, and A-D and F-I would fight with each other because they consider each other to be strangers to the other's camp...
- In such cases, duplicating E will clear up the problem.

    - If you make it a cross circle or connect the two E's with an equal when you illustrate it later, you'll know what I mean.
    - Sometimes when I try to put a nameplate on each of them after putting them in two groups like this, I realize that I was focusing on a different [[side]] of E!
    - The content of one label E can be verbalized in more detail in E after the fact by being placed in a different context.
- The opinion of <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Jiro Kawakita/icon' alt='Jiro Kawakita.icon' height="19.5"/> on a case similar to this is that "E should be [[ape]]".
- > I often see people who resolve two or three small groups to form a larger group. This is because one or two pieces seem to be related to both Group A and Group B, and they try to solve the dilemma by creating a group that combines A and B, avoiding the one-sidedness of putting one of the pieces in either group. Instead, it is better to leave a monkey or two out of the problem and group A and B separately in a small group. If it is natural, Group A, Group B, and the separate monkey pieces will all be grouped together in the second stage of grouping. ([[Continuing Ideas]] p.60-62)
    - This means the idea that "the next step will be this form

    - [[A cylinder looks like a circle or a square, but it is neither a circle nor a square]]
