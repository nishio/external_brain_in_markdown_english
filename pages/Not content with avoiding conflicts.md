title: "Not content with avoiding conflicts"
---

> It is one thing for the Japanese to tend to [[avoid]] [[complex inter-relationships (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]] and another thing for the Japanese to prefer to avoid conflicts. It is another matter that Japanese people prefer to avoid conflicts. For example, suppose that in a meeting, when you noticed that your colleague was making a wrong argument, you did not express your opinion because you thought that pointing out his/her error would raise an angle and you did not want to disturb the situation. If you feel dissatisfied because you cannot say what you want to say at your workplace, you are avoiding a conflict, but you are not [[satisfied]] with the action itself.
