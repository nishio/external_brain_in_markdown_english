title: "Objects and Phenomena"

- [[Ding an sich]] and [[phenomenon]].
- I think we use the word "phenomenon" as an everyday word without thinking much about it.

>  In [[Kant]], the phenomenon was contrasted with the thing itself, and considered to be constituted by the joint work of the thing itself and the [[subject]].
