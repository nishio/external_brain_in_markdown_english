title: "iPad term"

As for pen-like input devices, [Thnkpad X41 Tablet](https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2005/0608/lenovo.htm) (released in 2005) was the first, except for external tablets. However, I did not make much use of it.
I changed from the original iPad to the iPad Air on 2014-01-04 and am trying the stylus because of the increased reaction time.
I started to include [[hand drawn diagrams]] in my presentation materials in 2010, and the demand for them has been increasing.
- Before the iPad, I used to take pictures of what I drew on [[whiteboard]] or notepad.
For a while after that, I posted diagrams drawn with the stylus on Facebook, but the slow response time prevented me from making much use of it.

Purchased [[iPad Pro]] in 2018. Accompanied [[Jun Kuikei]] in his activities and took classes with [[Kazuhiro Shiozawa]].
