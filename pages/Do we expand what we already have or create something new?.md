- A: [[Expanding already existing territory]].
- B: [[Explore new flying sites]].

A is less [[uncertainty]], so there is a bias for people with low [[risk tolerance]] to do A.
- No, no, no, they took from where it was easy to take, and as a result, there are now only high-cost areas left to expand.
    - There is precedent for having done this type of expansion before, so we will do the same.
    - It only spreads a little, but "It spread, success!" but "It spread!

Is B risky?

    - [[Seven Opportunities for Innovation]]
    - Cases where there is an obvious need or supply-demand gap
        - Just do it, why isn't anyone doing it?
    - There's "[[unforeseen event]]" at the destination where you did it.
        - This is only visible to those who have done it.
