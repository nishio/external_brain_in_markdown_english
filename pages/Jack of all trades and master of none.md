title: "Jack of all trades and master of none"
---

>  Masafumi Otsune] I wonder who first came up with the term "poor dexterity" to describe people who are "overconcentrated [[in something]] that interests them, so they learn faster than others and seem to be improving, but when they reach a certain level, they hit a [[wall]] and their [[sense of accomplishment]] diminishes, so they end up [[weariness]]. Who was the first person to start referring to people who have "a disposition to [[weariness]] because they hit a [[wall]] and their sense of accomplishment decreases once they reach a certain level" as "poor in dexterity"? --- [facebook [https://www.facebook.com/otsune/posts/pfbid0agrYxH1iewgGfw2PebgnessWS37nr59H6deWo9krSorsKNsSZAQY6Yv2JcvBQQGQl?comment_](https://www.facebook.com/otsune/posts/pfbid0agrYxH1iewgGfw2PebgnessWS37nr59H6deWo9krSorsKNsSZAQY6Yv2JcvBQQGQl?comment_) id=152044611247073]
- For what it's worth, "[[clumsy]]"...

The automatic English translation translated "dexterity" into "Jack of all trades and master of none.

The phrase "dexterous poverty" (kiyōbinbō) is an interesting aspect of Japanese culture. Let's break down the term: "dexterity" (kiyō) translates to "skillful" or "adroit", referring to someone who is capable of handling many different tasks or fields. "Poverty" (binbō) means "poor", indicating the lack of wealth or success.

The phrase is often used to describe a person who, while capable in many areas, fails to excel in any one particular field. This lack of specialization, it implies, keeps them from achieving substantial success or wealth. This is reflected in the idiom's rough translation: "skillful but poor".

In comparison, the English phrase "jack of all trades, master of none" also describes a person with a wide array of skills but without a specialization. However, there are some nuanced differences between the two phrases.

While the English idiom doesn't necessarily imply failure or poverty, it carries an underlying suggestion that a person might be better off if they specialized in something. It's more of a caution against spreading oneself too thin.

In the context of Japanese culture, which often values deep expertise and mastery in a single area, this term suggests that a lack of specialization can directly lead to a lack of success or financial stability. In the context of Japanese culture, which often values deep expertise and mastery in a single area, this term suggests that a lack of specialization can directly lead to a lack of success or financial stability.

The understanding of both phrases certainly depends on cultural context. Yet they both speak to a universal tension between being broadly competent versus being highly specialized.

By comparison, the English phrase "jack of all trades, master of none" also describes a person with a wide range of skills but no expertise. However, there is a subtle difference between the two phrases.
The English idiom does not necessarily imply failure or poverty, but the underlying implication is that you might be better off if you specialize in something. If anything, it is an admonition not to overextend oneself.
On the other hand, "dexterity poverty" seems to carry a stronger criticism. In the context of Japanese culture, which often values deep expertise and proficiency in a single field, this term suggests that lack of expertise is directly related to lack of success and economic stability.
Both terms are certainly understood differently by different cultural backgrounds. But both illustrate the universal tension between having a broad range of competencies and a high degree of specialization.
