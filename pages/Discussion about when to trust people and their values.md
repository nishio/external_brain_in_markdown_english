- Mr. Tachikawa has doubts about people who speak confidently.
- The discussion revolves around moments of trust in people, their values, and their purpose.

pickup
- No one listening to a presentation is interested if the person speaking does not sound confident, so no matter how anxious or worried you are, you should present with full confidence.
- I wonder if people who make confident presentations aren't thinking for themselves.
- [[If you were thinking for yourself, you would be more troubled]].
- In what situations and when do we trust people?
    - It has to do with werewolves.
- [Values and Purpose
    - It's better to separate values from objectives.

Nishio: But the very first time I gave a presentation, I was very nervous and slurred my words, and I don't remember who told me this, but I was told that if a speaker looks unsure of himself or herself, no one listening to the presentation will find it interesting, so no matter how anxious or worried one may be, one should always give a presentation with full confidence. I thought, "I see.
Man X: It has implications.
Nishio: So I guess it has a little bit to do with making 〓01:38:00〓 with werewolves.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Nishio: 〓01:38:07分? 〓 I'm sorry.
Tachikawa: That 〓 01:38:09 minute? 〓 Or maybe it's just maybe. Maybe my way of looking at the world is a little different from yours. I don't know. I don't know.
Nishio: At any rate, just say it.
Tachikawa: I wonder if he is not thinking for himself.
Man Y: I see.
Tachikawa: I would think that if he were thinking for himself, he would be more troubled. I have seen it that way, that the person who is more troubled is this person, thinking with his or her own head. There are probably many ways to look at it, and it depends on the person. For example, some people trust a person who speaks confidently, while others may trust a person who is not so confident. Well, it depends on the situation and the place. For example, I'm a werewolf...hmm...hmm...hmm...hmm...hmm. I play werewolf. But when I am asked by clients at work whether I would do marriage activity in my home or not, I always say with confidence, "It would be better to do it in my home for sure. I say with great confidence, "You should definitely do it at my place. And they all come to us. I say with a straight face, "Are you sure you want to do something worthwhile if you come to us and then decide not to go with us?
Male X: Well, I think that's good.
Tachikawa: And then, this is exactly the point of the werewolf project, when and under what circumstances do we trust people? This is interesting, so I would like to dig a little deeper. This is interesting, so I'd like to dig a little deeper. You said earlier that it is better to think about values and purpose separately, right?
Man X: Oh, no. I said that I had been living my life in a blur, but the moment I was told, I thought, "Oh, that's different.
Tachikawa: Different values and objectives?
Male X: There was a moment when I thought it was different, but when they told me, it was all messed up again.
Nishio: He says he is not sure anymore when he is told.
