- Bitcoin is intended to implement an "electronic cash system," as the title of the 2008 paper suggests. The objective is focused on the currency function itself.
- Ethereum was designed in the 2013 White Paper to be the "next generation platform for distributed applications/smart contracts" or "world computer."
- The contrast of "making money vs. making computers" is generally accurate, as it succinctly illustrates the design motivation for both projects.
- Note that Ethereum also requires the native currency ETH, and Bitcoin has limited scripting capabilities, so it is not completely bifurcated.
