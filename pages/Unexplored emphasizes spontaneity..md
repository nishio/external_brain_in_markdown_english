- [[A third place to stimulate children's creativity]] like [[unexplored junior high school]] [concept [https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8E%E3%83%](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8E%E3%83%) 99%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%9F%E3%83%BC%E6%A7%8B%E6%83%B3] and discussing "[[ unexplored culture]]", and it was suggested that it would not work well to duplicate only the form of unexplored junior without "unexplored culture", but the word "unexplored [[culture]]" is unclear and needs to be further elaborated.

Since its inception, the MIZUHATSU has always been about "support for individual creators, not grants to companies.
The "PM System" has also been adopted, in which the review of applications is not conducted by a committee but left to the judgment of individuals. The "Mentor" system, which has been renamed to "Mentor," has also been adopted in MIZUKEN JUNIOR, but the system of individual decision-making has been continued.

I think these two "leveraging the power of the individual" are important factors.
This direction has been expressed in many different words by now: "I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.
    - [[spontaneous]] 　 [[spontaneity]] 　 [[intrinsic motivation]] 　 [[enthusiasm]]
    - [[ability to move forward on one's own]] 　 [[self-propulsion]] 　 [[first penguin]]
    - [[feeling that something is one's own affair]] 　 [[overwhelming awareness of the parties involved]]

The culture that considers this kind of thing good is, of course, not exclusive to the unexplored.
- In the process of discussing the culture of our own community within the unexplored community, the term "unexplored culture" was coined.
- This language is not good because it feels exclusionary to those outside the unexplored community
- It seems more appropriate to interpret that there is an as yet unnamed "Culture X", that the culture of the unexplored community is Culture X, and that there are other Culture X communities
- For example, [[CoderDojo]] is clearly Culture X
    - > CoderDojo is a global, free network that is non-profit and voluntary. The participants themselves decide what they want to learn.
        - ["Thinking together, not teaching, and children learning from each other" CoderDojo Japan Representative Director Mr. Yasukawa | STEAM JAPAN](https://steam-japan.com/report/2886/)
    - > All dojos are autonomous community groups that support the younger generation in learning independently.
