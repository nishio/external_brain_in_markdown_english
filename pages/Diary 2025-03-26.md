I used it in a big way because the ACU extinction deadline for [[Devin]] was coming up.
After all, using lots of Devin in parallel efficiently punctures the head.
Two or three is the limit of how I feel.

I'm off to buy dinner while I try to figure out why that is.

We have to distinguish between speed and the number of parallels.
For the purpose of increasing speed, I think the fastest state would be with one person concentrating on single threading and using Klein or something similar.
- Parallel number]" or

Open source development raises the number of parallels.
While I was fixing the API side of Azure, another person was creating a make file to deploy Azure, which is exactly what the parallel count is going up.

Open source development does not guarantee when workers will start and which tasks they will grab [[concurrent processing]].
This is quite similar to when I use Devin. Devin does the job I tell it to do, but when I think it is doing it, it stumbles and stops. Sometimes he will run in the wrong direction while you are not looking.

> [[Concurrency]] is an attribute of systems in computer science that involve calculations that run overlapping in time and may share resources in such calculations.
- [Concurrency - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%A6%E8%A1%8C%E6%80%A7)

Open source workers don't do the work I expect. It can't be helped.
So create opportunities for work, but don't expect someone else to do the work.
So, ultimately, you will be doing the tasks above the line that are necessary to achieve the objectives you want to achieve.
You have to be prepared to do everything on that line yourself without expecting others to do it for you, but on the other hand, sometimes others do it for you and make your work easier. I am very grateful when this happens.
You can tell Devin what to do. Do not expect the results that come out to be acceptable as they are. In the future, the probability of what can be expected may increase, but at present, it is necessary to correct the situation from the landing point. I have written two diagrams on this in the past.
    - [[The leaky hole of abstraction gets smaller.]]
    - [[I don't expect others to do it.]]

Some thoughts on why we are confused
- When switching between tasks, you see other tasks making progress.
- It is a much slower way to proceed, managing contextual information so that there is no confusion when switching between tasks.
- When you are working alone, you underestimate the need for it. That's because the number of parallels when we've been working alone has been small.
- So, you accidentally switch tasks without doing the work to make the context information persistent.
- This causes confusion due to the loss of contextual information.
- Essentially, you're going to have to pay the same amount of overhead when working with AI agents to perpetuate contextual information as the overhead you're incurring when doing team development.
- You misinterpret this as "working alone," but this should be thought of as "working in a team" of one human AI many
        - [[Single or team development]]
- Developing with Klein on a single thread is the same situation as doing pair programming, same with looking at Devin's screen.
- They do it because the cost of task switching is too low to do it quickly, and simply gesturing with the touchpad switches the virtual desktop.
- But in a real-world metaphor, it would be like pairing up with coworker A in conference room A, and while coworker A is thinking about it, you move to conference room B in 0.5 seconds, look at coworker B's screen, and start pairing up, where you need to put some head-switching time in between.


memo
- Paper notes or handwritten notes on an iPad do not link to URLs.
- Keep browser tabs open to express waiting for AI response
    - But the tab icons don't tell me what the task is.
        - I'm not even sure of the condition.
    - I try to open the desired one and end up looking at something else.
        - When I see a response back from the AI, I get distracted from continuing that task.

Should all necessary windows be gathered in a virtual desktop based on task
- virtual room
- Misson Control's virtual desktop is said to be able to produce up to 16 virtual desktops.
- [https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/macinfo/1424767.html](https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/macinfo/1424767.html)
- Can the app be tied to a specific desktop?
    - It's on an application-by-application basis, though.
    - Not good for situations where you have a lot of things up and running in your browser.

Mission Control does not listen when many tabs are open in a full-screen browser
- Should I open them in separate windows?

When people are using Cline, there's a shared memory feel.
And human memory is occupied.

Devin proceeds with the work without a human being watching.
It could be viewed from a Cline perspective.

When you are entrusting some task to a processor that is not you and it fails or is blocked waiting for input.
Without notifications, though, I'd have to go look more often,
And I don't want the notification to interrupt me,
So this means that the notification should go into the event queue,
People go to the queue and process when it's convenient.
