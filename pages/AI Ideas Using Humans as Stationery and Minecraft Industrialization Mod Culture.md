AI Ideas Using Humans as Stationery and Minecraft Industrialization Mod Culture
Abstract: Connects the idea of "[[AI using humans as stationery]]" with the open source culture of the Minecraft industrialization mod community.

Commentary:
- Minecraft's industrialization mod has a culture where the community shares knowledge and code in an open source manner, and players use this knowledge like a tool to play.
- The idea of AI using humans as "[[stationery]]" may seem strange at first glance, but it can actually be interpreted as a relationship in which humans share knowledge and ideas in open source, which AI then uses as a "reference tool.
- There are freely available ideas (MODs) within the community, and AI combines them to generate sophisticated answers. If open source knowledge = human-made stationery, then the Minecraft industrialized MOD culture is the ideal environmental model for AI to assemble knowledge components.
