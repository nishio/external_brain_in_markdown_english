title: "Lotus Sutra"
---

Around A.D., the meaning of "[[bodhisattva]]" changed from "[[a person]] who has attained enlightenment" ([[Shakyamuni Buddha]], [[Maitreya]]) to "[[a person]] who seeks enlightenment" (anyone), and Mahayana Buddhism was born.
From the side of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which was a small force, came the [[Prajnaparamita Sutra]], which criticized the [[Setsu-all-embracing]] sect, and the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]] was established in the 1st and 2nd centuries, which criticized the sectarian Buddhism, and around the 1st and 3rd centuries, the Lotus Sutra was created to aufheben that confronted this conflict.
