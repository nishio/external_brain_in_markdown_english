Source code and [[developer resources]] need to be distinguished

2024-02-08
"Source code is a resource that can be replicated at almost zero cost, so it should be "available to everyone", while "actions that consume limited human time" such as inquiries and requests should only be allowed to those who are clearly demarcated, or the two types of resources are somehow tied together. It's not a good idea to do that."

When I read Elinor Ostrom's "Governance of the Commons", I came to "those who have access to the resource must be clearly demarcated" in Condition 1, which means "freely available to all" is wrong after all... times.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1754653813603246113) No, wait, are you saying that since source code is a resource that can be replicated at almost zero cost, it should be "available to everyone", while "actions that consume limited human time" such as inquiries and requests should be allowed only to those who are clearly classified? On the other hand, "actions that consume limited human time" such as inquiries and requests should be allowed only to those who are clearly classified, or is it wrong to somehow combine these two kinds of resources?

The rules must be in harmony with the rules for the supply of labor, materials, and expenses (Condition 2). Violations are monitored (condition 4) and violators are sanctioned according to severity (condition 5).
