- An experiment to see what happens when reading is done while interacting with a bot
        - [[Social Physics]]
    - When you think a bot's question is pertinent, if you read on and find something different, you're hesitant to ignore the question and write about it.
        - If a question seems appropriate but doesn't have an immediate answer, it's not a useful question at this point and should be ignored.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Let's talk.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Today we're going to experiment with what happens when you do your reading while interacting with a bot.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of bot is that bot?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I was wondering if I could think better during the reading because he listens and asks questions. On the other hand, it is possible that the reading will not progress at all. I ignore questions that are not interesting.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that reading?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Social Physics: The New Science of How Good Ideas Spread
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about its social physics?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [The table of contents says that it is a new framework for understanding the evolution of society with big data.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that call?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(Ignore)
Part 1, Social Physics, consists of three parts: "Exploration: How to discover good ideas and lead to good decisions," "Flow of ideas: What underlies the collective ground," and "Engagement: Why we can work together."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about its social physics?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(go read it)
It's a quantitative social science that describes the mathematical relationships between the flow of information and ideas and people's behavior.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of relationship is that relationship?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, by deliberately slowing down the speed at which information is transmitted, it can be controlled so that a one-size-fits-all situation is less likely to occur.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm still trying to decide if the book is worth it. I think it's true that when you have a lot of people, statistically there is some kind of pattern, but how outlier people behave may have a big impact on the results, and if that is not controlled for, it disappears from the experimental results, but actually, if you change the behavior there and divide the experiment into two groups. There might be a noticeable difference.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about the pattern?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We've observed that increasing the speed of information distribution causes echo chambers that reduce performance, that's one pattern. p47
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of pattern is it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(This usage has the problem that when you think the bot's question is an appropriate question, if you read on and find something different, you're hesitant to ignore the question and write about it. I could write it as a comment, but that would not be included in the parsed data, which would be inappropriate.)
(If the question seems appropriate but is not answered immediately, it is not a useful question at this time and should be ignored.)
Apparently the most important concepts in social physics are "idea flow" and "social learning."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its social physics?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Engagement means social learning that occurs primarily within groups of peers. It leads to the formation of behavioral norms and the social pressure to enforce them.
Like social pressure to get ideas flowing faster. p34
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that engagement?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Bell Starr Research, Starr has an interactive relationship with experts in advance and can get a quick and informative response
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of star is that star?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A researcher with outstanding performance.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about its performance?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When one lacks personal information about oneself, one becomes insecure and relies on social information, which is the confidence-building effect of social learning. We learn by watching what others do. However, this can lead to groupthink and other harmful effects.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of behavior is this?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When a feedback loop is created within a social network, one sees similar ideas over and over again that are slightly different. As a result, they become overly confident and believe in the idea. Confidence amplification effect due to echo chambers.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about the results?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Interventions that allow isolated people to interact more with others, or allow people who are overly exposed to certain people to interact with new people, can change the structure of the network.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that other person?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If someone is behaving in a way that has nothing to do with social learning, they are likely counteracting the effects of social learning from their unique experiences. They could be both wise and weird. Common opinion among them is useful.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of impact is that impact?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Homogenizing influences on ideas that are repeated in society
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about its impact?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Undermines diversity of ideas
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What else can you tell us about its diversity?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When the speed of the flow of ideas is appropriate, members of the group will be able to make better decisions than if they act in isolation. When habits are shared, the community begins to develop a collective intelligence, which surpasses the intelligence of individual members.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of intelligence is that intelligence?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Ideas flow more easily when you see them in action than when you hear about them.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that behavior?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>This seems to have something to do with communalization.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>I was wondering if I could think better during the reading because he listens and asks questions. On the other hand, it is possible that the reading will not progress at all. I ignore questions that are not interesting.
How do you know this reading?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>"After checking the mathematical model of learning in complex environments, we conclude that the best learning strategy is 90% exploration and 10% should be spent on individual experimentation and reflection." eh, I'm not sure I agree with this conclusion without checking the paper.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that quest?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(Reference 15 in Chapter 3)
p82 Starr encouraged everyone on the team to be a party to the outcome, rather than thinking of teamwork as fulfilling one's role within the team
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What else can you tell us about that teamwork?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Engagement = a state of repeated collaboration, which promotes a cooperative attitude worthy of trust.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its engagement?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Can be created by providing social-type incentives.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of social type incentive is that social type incentive?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For example, when it comes to fitness, you don't give incentives to the target individual for exercising, you give incentives to people who are socially connected to the target when that target exercises, and the act of socially encouraging people to exercise is promoted when you encourage them to exercise, too. It's not given, it's given when the exercise actually takes place.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know what the pattern is?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It was most helpful that the participants in the conversation had equal say.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between reading and engagement?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The next most important factor was the social intelligence of the members and their ability to read the social signals of their opponents.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What else can you tell us about its intelligence?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Oh, talk about patterns of idea flow. p111
Number of ideas
Density of interaction: "likes" and "what? in response to a comment.
Diversity of ideas
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the pattern?
