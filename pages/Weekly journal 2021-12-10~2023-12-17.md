What did you do last week?
- Creating experimental scripts using [LangChain
    - Using LangChain, I gave him the Scrapbox URL, and he [[Bashi]] translated it into English, and then another person [[Kai Harada]] wrote his thoughts on it, and then translated it back into Japanese.
    - I'm still thinking "hmmm" when I look at the results, but for now, I'll write a code to process them all together for the past N days because N=1.
- [[Scrapboxing of past presentations]].
    - Related: [[Summary of past presentations]].
    - I want to stop [[Slideshare]].
    - I converted everything I could find to Scrapbox format, but not all of it.
    - Where are the others?
        - We should look for it and create a specific folder in Dropbox to put it together.
- Preparation of materials for internal presentations
- [[pEnglish]]
        - [[Conflict resolution thinking on the trade-off between translation quality and speed]]
        - [[One happy person is all it takes to motivate me.]]
            - [[Portal or no portal is a false choice]]
