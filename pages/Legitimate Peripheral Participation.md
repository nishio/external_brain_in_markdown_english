I am reading regarding legitimate peripheral participation.
- Learning is not something an individual does, but a community does
- Learning is not the acquisition of structure, but the learner's ability to participate in the work of a skilled person and be able to fulfill his/her role.
I guess I should imagine it more like an apprenticeship.

- No, it would be a misnomer to say so. The idea of referring to apprenticeship in education has been around for a long time, and various educational concepts have been called apprenticeship, but this does not fit well with apprenticeship as it is practiced in reality, and the concept of legitimate peripheral participation was born as a term that more clearly captures the real-life characteristics of apprenticeship.
- I wonder if we accept as axiomatic that "there is no activity that is not embedded in a situation."
- Ah, I see. In applying [[U-theory]]'s transition from Level 2 to Level 3 to learning, I understood it as a change from learning as "the answers are outside of you and you copy them into yourself" to learning as "a community that refines knowledge by teaching each other," but regarding the latter of these, If there is already an existing community established, can it be interpreted as learning through peripheral participation in that community?
- So the transition from Level 3 to Level 4, which has been unclear until now, can also be called a transition to "activities where no existing community exists"?
- To begin with, he pointed out that conventional schooling is designed on the premise that it can teach abstract knowledge divorced from context.
- I see what you mean. In conventional school education, the model is that the teacher gives "intentional teaching" and the students receive it to "understand" and "learn" on their own, but when I observe the actual apprenticeship system, there is little intentional classroom teaching. Here, on the contrary, students actively access what they want to know and do, and "learning" takes place as feedback.
- Yes, over here, "learning" is a social act. So, showing "you are a member of this community" with "legitimate participation" is a source of motivation to be able to do what the skilled people on the periphery are able to do, and not being given a task with heavy responsibility at first with "peripheral participation" makes room to voluntarily try something more difficult. This is why it is called "legitimate peripheral participation. So, legitimate peripheral participation. I see.
