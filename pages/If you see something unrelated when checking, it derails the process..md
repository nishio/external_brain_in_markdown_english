If you see something unrelated when checking, it derails the process.

prev  [[You're working on something and then you come up with another idea.]]
Also, when I went to check on the current status of Task A.
I saw the progress of Task B and it took away from my attention.
Next thing you know, A doesn't progress, B progresses and C grows.
I think the essential problem is that we're trying to do this A and we're [[derailment]].

I must not have tabs in my browser.
There are 16 virtual desktops, that's not good either.
