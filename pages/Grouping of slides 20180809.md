- What is happening at 44 seconds is the grouping of slides as planned
    - The slide closest to the laser pointer is the front cover, and the remaining slides become smaller and stick to the perimeter.
- I'm not sure how to handle the swiping on the actual controller, but then the swiping activates on its own and the slide keeps coming closer and closer, so I'm not able to control it the way I want to.
