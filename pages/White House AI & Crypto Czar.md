The "[[AI & Crypto Czar]]" is a newly established position by the [[Trump Administration]], officially named the "White House AI & Crypto Czar." The purpose is to develop a legal framework for the United States to demonstrate global leadership in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, and to promote innovation. The current position is held by [[David Sachs]], a former [[PayPal]] executive and prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who aims to improve U.S. technology competitiveness by promoting industry-required regulatory clarity and deregulation of previously overreaching regulations.
