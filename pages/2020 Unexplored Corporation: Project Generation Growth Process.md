- > MITOH is an "innovation platform" that builds a "pool of high-level IT human resources" including MITOH creators and creates projects to solve social issues. In order to realize the above, we will build a "pool of advanced IT human resources" to create technology-based solutions and a "collaboration hub" to implement solutions by advanced IT human resources in society. From the pool of advanced IT human resources, those with "strong passion" and "appropriate skills" to solve a specific social issue will create a solution (MVP) to solve that social issue and help it become a product or service that will actually be implemented in society.

My draft before the designer's cleanup.

- I'll try to verbalize what I think is not being communicated in comparison.
    - Repeat Meet]" is a stand-alone cycle
    - Repeated meetings" create budding
    - Cycle of budding
        - The "issues" here are "[[moderately sized issues]]" and "[[clearly verbalized issues]]."
        - Such "[[good assignments]]" elicit ideas from others who hear them.
        - Talking about an idea inspires me to implement it ([[enthusiasm]])
            - Related: [[Good people talk about ideas.]]
        - Why is there an arrow from enthusiasm to the task?
            - Often a "vague sense of the issue" is brought in from the outside.
            - In order for it to become a clearly isolated and verbalized "issue," there must be at least one person who is [[empathetic]] and enthusiastic about that sense of issue.
                    - [[making something one's own]]
    - When three things come together - a clear problem, an idea for a solution, and people with enthusiasm for the solution - that is the "budding of a project"!
    - At this point, when multiple "enthusiastic people" are involved, collaboration begins.
        - This is a form of success
        - Related: [[Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, working together is success.]]
    - Connecting resources to a project in a way that accelerates it
        - What the resources are depends on the project.
        - Money, of course, but basically [[Cash is weak capital]].
            - What can be procured from the market with money is not [[a rare resource]].
                - [Difficult-to-procure resources are important
        - Knowledge often leads to a state of "if you don't have basic knowledge, you don't know how to get advanced knowledge"
                - [[The strong get stronger and stronger]]
    - First, we must create a prototype and conduct experiments [[PDCA cycle]], and then we must go through the cycle of actually using the prototype in society, and when it is successfully embedded in society, it will become an "innovation.
            - [[U-curve model]]
    - It's a little odd that "resources" is connected to "projects" at the beginning of "grow" in the original draft diagram.

        - Often, the creators quickly build the prototype with their own hands and then stumble in the process of connecting it to the [[social implementation]].

        - effect
    - The reason we use "[[collaborative project]]" rather than just "project" is our perspective as a "[[collaboration hub]]".
        - Of course, projects can be created even with a single creator, and can lead to innovation through prototyping and social implementation.
        - However, basically, all the "unexplored creators" have their own individual projects, and if we support them simply because their projects exist, we may end up supporting all of them. In addition, there are already various options in society to support individuals, including the main body of the "Unexplored" project.
        - The role that unexplored foundations should play is still "connection among [[unexplored human resources]]". Therefore, it is necessary to focus on new combinations of multiple people.
            - Related: [[Unexplored as a network formation system]].

- Issues I thought about when I wrote this.
    - The new Corona has made it harder to plan a "physical gathering place".
    - There is a wall between "getting to know each other" and "budding," and what should be done about this?

- 2022-08-24Reading back and thinking about the issue
    - It is obvious that the inflow is IPA unexplored.
        - Unexplored juniors not included.
        - We want to create a place where interesting people can connect without limiting it to the unexplored in the first place.
    - I think "sow" was added by the designer for balance, but you need a seed to sow. Here it is "cultivate.
    - The label "[[link]]" between resources and projects has disappeared, so the relationship between the two is no longer clear.
    - Innovation creates [[economic value]] and [[social value]] in parallel.
