[[TV remote control with tons of buttons]].
> If we adopt more and more (pull requests), we will end up with dirty software with a lot of buttons, like a TV remote control with a lot of buttons, with a lot of gobbledygook and subtle perfection options.

[[TV remote control is full of buttons]].
>  "Casual gamers tend to request more elements, thereby complicating the game."
>  Why this happens is the same principle as [[a TV remote control full of buttons]].
>  Making a small number of button combinations work is loaded for many people's cognition = "cognitively complex."
>  That's why the "cognitively simple design" that "one function is activated by pressing one button" is chosen.
>  As a result, TV remotes are full of buttons and the remotes look "complicated".

[[There are a lot of buttons on the remote that I don't use.]]
> Difficult to find the desired button due to the many unused buttons on the remote control.
