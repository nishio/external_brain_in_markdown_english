<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When I use the term "mindshare," I'm thinking of the percentage of a person's awareness of a subject.
- When you're so absorbed in a project that you forget to eat or sleep, your mindshare in that project is 100%."
- When you have things you want to do, but are interrupted by a barrage of chores that need to be done in a hurry, "it takes away from your mindshare."
