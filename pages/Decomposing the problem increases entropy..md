title: "Decomposing the problem increases entropy."

> The way of thinking about a given design problem is to break the problem down into even smaller problems, which tends to elevate the design [[entropy]]. Rather, when a problem is discovered, we must look for the larger, underlying problem behind that problem, taking into account its impact and balance on the system as a whole, rather than thinking about localized solutions.
