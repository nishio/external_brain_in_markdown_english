title: 'Turning "I can" into "I want to'
---

- The phenomenon that what you think "[[be made]]" becomes "[[want to do]]".
- Children are easily made to feel inferior by being physically outmatched by the adults around them #Adlerian psychology
- There is a self-image of being perceived as "incapable" by those around you.
- This is where the desire to be appreciated by those around you arises by actually doing what you say you can do.
- Desire for growth, desire to expand self

- Contrary to trying to develop skills to be able to do what you want to do.
- I just want to do what I think I can do and be appreciated.
- So, if it seems more difficult than you think, you lose motivation to do it.
- Because other "do-able" things seem easier.
