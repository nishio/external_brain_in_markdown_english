title: "It is easier to explain if there is a prototype."

> If I just say, "It's easier to explain a proposal if you have [[prototype]]," will people misunderstand that prototypes are made in a text-format programming language?
> It doesn't matter if it's Scratch, NoCode, or [paper prototype](https://uxmilk.jp/75270)!
> You can use any tool you want, but you have to make the idea go from being "only in your brain" to "something you can show to others", show it to multiple people and observe their reactions (different people react differently), and don't get discouraged if the reaction is not good ([It's up to you to make the most of your idea or kill it. or kill it.)
