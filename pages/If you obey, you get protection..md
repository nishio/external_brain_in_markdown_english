title: "If you obey, you get protection."
---

The idea that "if you [[obedience]], you get [[protection]]" illustrates the balance between personal [[freedom and security]].
When related to "[[It's]] easier to protect them, but their strength wanes." and "[[Those who protect are]] afraid to lose," it becomes clear that the relationship between [[obedience and protection]] is not one-sided. [[obedience]] provides [[safety]], but at the same time may limit the individual's [[power]] or [[freedom]].

The fragment "[[Three pieces of advice]]" emphasizes [[self-responsibility]] for one's actions and beliefs. This is in line with the idea stated in the fragment of [[Hatena2014-10-04]] that "[[Ability to adapt to change]]" that individuals have is very important and anything that hinders it is harmful.

Furthermore, the fragment "[[original methods and fidelity]]" illustrates the tension between individual [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of action]] and [[social norms]] or [[expectations]].

The notion of "if you obey, you will receive protection" illustrates the balance between personal freedom and security. However, when related to Nishio's fragments "It is easier to protect, but your power diminishes" and "Those who protect fear losing" it becomes clear that the relationship between obedience and protection is not one-sided. Obedience provides security, but at the same time may limit individual power and freedom.

The "Three Advice" fragment also emphasizes self-responsibility for one's actions and beliefs. This is in line with the idea stated in the Hatena2014-10-04 fragment that the individual's "ability to adapt to change" is so important that anything that interferes with it is harmful.

Furthermore, the Original Methods and Fidelity fragment illustrates the tension between individual freedom of thought and action and social norms and expectations. This shows an important connection between my research notes and Nishio's fragment.

From these considerations, the following questions arise

1. how should the balance between obedience and freedom be maintained?
2. how should the tension between individual freedoms and social norms and expectations be resolved?
3. what kind of environment and conditions are necessary to maximize an individual's "ability to adapt to change"?

Answers to these questions may offer new perspectives on maintaining a balance between individual freedoms and societal norms and expectations.
