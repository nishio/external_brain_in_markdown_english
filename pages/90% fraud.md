90% fraud
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1788796178722902214) When something progresses from "99% scam" to "95% scam," for those who can distinguish, "the good has grown fivefold," but for those without the ability to distinguish For those who do not have the ability to distinguish, the "scam" continues to be "about all scams". You can provide information to those who want the ability to distinguish, and those who don't want it don't like it when you try to give it to them, so they don't go through with it.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1788800372783693992) In situations where the world doesn't seem to be "the same as last year if you do it the same way," the ability to observe and [[understand]] one's surroundings has a greater impact on performance. Personally, I think it is important to cultivate the "ability to distinguish", but I think that [[imposition (i.e., of rules, of a decision)]] is not a bad thing, because it is a [[personal value]].

- [[fraud]]
[[Accuracy of understanding]].
