title: "Why is the desire to have children so low?"
---


From my perspective, my wife's desire was surprisingly low.
- I don't know exactly why that is,
    - The first is that by the existence of a sister who is 12 years younger and very much like herself, the biological need to duplicate genes is, to some extent, already fulfilled.
    - Another thing, the presence of a cat, a physical being of warm flesh that weighs about as much as a baby, would be fulfilling the need to some extent.
        - There is a miscellaneous rumor that single women will stop marrying if they start owning cats, but I suppose that means that cats reduce the desire to "get married and have children" to some extent.
        - Well, unlike humans, cats are predicted to probably die before we do.
            - In humans, we tend to implicitly assume that our children will outlive us
            - So I think there's a chance I'll miss them in my old age.
                - So I'm trying to avoid the "bigoted old man with no friends" route.
            - As to whether or not to consider children as a labor force for caregiving in old age, I think there are differences in the way people think about this. Even my parents are of the "I don't expect my children to care for me" school of thought, so I don't expect my children to be the labor force for caregiving either.

As for me personally, I don't know.
- I think there is a certain self-replicated requirement, but once I realized that my wife was not very enthusiastic about having children, I thought that it would be okay to have children in digital bodies rather than in protein bodies.
- If it costs, say, $10 million to construct a protein body child, he said, he is willing to invest $10 million in creating a digital body child if he does not have a protein body child.
- The temporal back and forth is a bit ponderous at the moment, but I think I have experienced writing a book and having it sell tens of thousands of copies, and having it used to teach students at various universities, and so on, by observing what is being replicated in regard to replication as a meme for me, fulfillment, and perhaps the desire to reproduce is eased.
    - However, that's not to say that best-selling authors don't have children.
    - I thought that it might be due to the fact that I do not place much value on my physical body in the first place.
- In terms of physical body, I have autistic tendencies myself, my sister is autistic, and statistically speaking, my children are more likely to be autistic.
    - The psychological cost of whether or not to challenge in that situation is high.
    - If your sister is autistic, you are looking at, well, what kind of burden the parents will suffer if their child is born with autism, so the presumed cost of having a child is greater.
    - It would be nice if a definite, smart child with no disabilities would be born, but this is a mess that is unpredictable by current science.
    - I think it would be interesting to have a smart kid, but on the other hand, starting the Unexplored Junior Program, 100 smart kids who are interested in software will apply every year, and mentoring one of them for six months will contribute to fulfilling their desire quite well. It might be annoying for the junior creators to be made to feel like a parent without their permission.
    - In fact, IT people who have had children around them often have mismatches, such as "my child is not interested in programming" or "my child is interested in sports while I am not interested in sports at all".
    - It has often been observed that children are not what you think they are going to grow up to be.
    - In that sense, the ability to mentor a child for six months by selecting a child with a fairly high probability of being interested and comfortable with engineering is an alternative to parenting that is quite satisfying per hour.
