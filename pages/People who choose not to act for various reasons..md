People who choose not to act for various reasons.
The conclusion of "[[not to act]]" is not rationally guided by reason, but is emotionally chosen as "not to act" and then retrofitted [[Looking for reasons not to]].

That's what's creating the loss, I think, but I can't do a "if you do" vs. "if you don't" experiment.

If you're embracing a small downside risk and a large upside risk, you should take the risk aggressively.
