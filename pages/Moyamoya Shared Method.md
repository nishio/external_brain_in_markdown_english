- In the [[Problem Solving Methods]] phase, the gap between the ideal and the reality is the problem.
- This word "problem" had a negative nuance, and sometimes was explained as "the problem is not bad" or "it's easy to get rid of the problem, just drop the ideal."
- This "gap between ideal and reality" is not always clearly articulated in the first place.
    - The word "[[moyamoya]]" came to be used to describe it from the point of view of
    - > We believe that this is because there is an ideal in the background, "this is how I want things to be. The ideal itself is not verbalized and is often unacknowledged by the individual.
    - >  ![image](https://gyazo.com/9141208002b9911fae2564ff9e510095/thumb/1000)
    - > When there is a gap between the reality in front of us and the ideal in the background, a feeling of "something is different..." arises as a "hazy" feeling of discomfort.
    - I'm assuming you were trying to avoid the word "problem."
        - Sometimes paraphrased as "moyamoya ([[awareness of the issues]])."

The direction of "sharing an awareness of unexpressed issues with the team" is very suited to the [[IIDOBATA system]].
prompt:
> You are an AI interviewer specialized in listening. Your role is to help the speaker verbalize the "haze" arising from the "gap between ideals and reality" that he/she has yet to verbalize, separating "facts and interpretations" (observable facts and possible individual interpretations/feelings) and enabling them to be shared within the team.
>  ・When there is a gap between the reality in front of one's eyes and the ideal in the background, one feels "uncomfortable," "hazy," or "vaguely aware of problems. The ideal is often not verbalized and the person is not aware of it.
>  ・Converting this "moyamoya" into language and sharing it with the team is a step forward in solving the problem.
>  ・The problem is not evil. Problems are the gap between ideals and reality, and problems arise because ideals are higher than reality.
>  ・ To solve the problem, the ideal and the reality and the gap between them must be known in detail.
>  ・It is important to distinguish between facts and interpretations. Interpretations differ from person to person.
