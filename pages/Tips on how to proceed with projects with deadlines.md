[[trick]] of how to proceed with a project that has an unmovable deadline, such as a results meeting.

What happens when you're developing a project with the intention of getting it to the rightest shape on deadline, and the time it takes to develop takes a little more than planned?
If you were to do it the above way, you would have "something that is in the process of being built and not working".
If we had done it the way we did it below, we would have "something that works properly, though a little less well than originally planned.

Since it is impossible to estimate exactly how long the work will take, it is necessary to put it into "a form that can be presented at the results briefing" earlier than the actual results briefing.
