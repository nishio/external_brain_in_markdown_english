Social Security and Financial Challenges
- While the [[cost of social security]] is increasing with the [[aging]] population, Japan's social security expenditures as a percentage of GDP are "moderate" compared to Europe and the US. However, spending will have to increase as the population continues to age.
- It is not realistic to simply cut social security spending, and revenue expansion is also necessary, but the hurdles to public understanding are high, making it difficult to proceed with consumption tax and other tax increases.

Expectations of efficiency gains through technology utilization (PoliTech)
- Prevention and diagnosis of medical and nursing care can be automated to [[optimize]] (reduce) medical costs. Wearable devices and data utilization will facilitate a shift from hospital-oriented care to [[home care]].
- The current situation is that regulations and systems on the government side are hindering the utilization of new technologies such as data and blockchain. An environment that allows companies and individuals to freely try out new technologies is needed.

Changes in work styles and employment
- If an environment is created in which people over 65 can continue to work, the number of elderly workers will increase and the labor shortage on the support side can be alleviated.
- There is also a proposal to encourage productivity growth by raising the minimum wage. In fact, Japan's per capita productivity (value added) is not that low, but average wages have been stagnant.
- Although there is a system in place whereby the longer a person delays the start of pension benefits, the more "profitable" it is, there is a significant problem with the lack of information reaching the public.

Difficulty in communicating information and building consensus
- Policies cannot be realized only through the idealism of scholars. It is essential to inform and convince the public.
- It is necessary to devise ways to communicate the benefits of data and technology in an easy-to-understand manner, and to gain the consensus of society as a whole.

Summary Points
- Increases in social security spending are inevitable, but there are limits to what can be achieved with a single-minded focus on reductions.
- New technologies (AI, big data, blockchain, etc.) will be used to streamline medical care, long-term care, etc., to reduce burdens and increase revenue.
- It is important to develop a system (e.g., employment and pension systems) that facilitates the work of diverse human resources, including the elderly.
- In order to deepen public understanding, it is necessary to promote easy-to-understand information dissemination and regulatory review (PoliTech).
