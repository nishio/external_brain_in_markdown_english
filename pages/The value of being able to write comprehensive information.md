title: "The value of being able to write comprehensive information"
---

- I want to verbalize the value I vaguely perceive in Scrapbox.
- Question: Is a properly tagged Evernote as effective as Scrapbox?
- What do you mean by "properly" when you say that Wiki and Evernote are in order?
- For example, if you use Evernote for clipping PDFs or the web and not tagging them, I don't think that is included in "properly tagging" here. Even with that kind of use, you can still accumulate information and find it in a search, but when "properly" is done, you get value other than that, and what is that?
    - Case study [Using Scrapbox, Dropbox and Evernote - shio✨ - Scrapbox [https://scrapbox.io/shio/Scrapbox%E3%80%81Dropbox%E3%80%81Evernote%E3%81%AE%E4%BD%](https://scrapbox.io/shio/Scrapbox%E3%80%81Dropbox%E3%80%81Evernote%E3%81%AE%E4%BD%) BF%E3%81%84%E5%88%86%E3%81%91]
    - I understand that Dr. Shiozawa's report above means that the use of Evernote has become limited because the value obtained by "properly" using Evernote is now obtained from Scrapbox instead of Evernote.
    - Perhaps the cost of doing it "properly" is easier in Scrapbox than in Evernote.

Value Proposal "I can write comprehensive information."
- Use Case Flow
    - Tag foo on individual pages
    - When you click on the tag foo, you can see a list of pages with the tag foo.
    - Write comprehensive information about those pages there (one-step [[abstraction]] concepts are verbalized)
    - Check against what you have written and notice any omissions of what you should have written.
- It is important to look at the list of pages with the tag foo and write information that [[having a bird's-eye view]].
    - It's not like a search; there is no place to write overhead information in the search results on foo.
        - By writing a little bit about [[standpoint]] and what you're going to write in the future, you can have a frame of reference to think over the tagged page.
- The tag foo page in Scrapbox has a blank space at the top, unlike the search results.
    - You can write here that these things are inclusive," he affords.
    - It encourages us to think inclusively.
- After a certain number of pages with the tag foo have accumulated, when you look at the tag foo page, you will see a blank space and a "list of pages with the tag foo". This makes the user feel like "I should write about what [[comprehensiveness]] has done.
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/0bdb0533d9a7f224617c0bdb2a450859/thumb/1000)
- This concept is similar to the [[KJ method]], "Let's collect the fusen that we think are somehow related," and "Next, let's think about why they were collected in one place and attach it to the [[doorplate]].
    - If "pages that you think are somehow related" are lined up below, instead of "pages with the tag foo," the act of writing the title in the blank space corresponds to [[nameplate]] in the KJ method. What you wrote in the title should be added to each page as a tag.
    - Unlike the KJ method, Scrapbox requires pre-language tags.
        - In the short term, the KJ method is easy because you can "sort of collect and then verbalize".
        - On the other hand, by putting tags in a messy way, "what I wrote foo today, what I wrote foo a month ago, ..." will be grouped together, and can be used instead of "collecting somehow". After looking at the collected items, you can add more detailed tags to some of them if necessary.

- This page was created after a discussion (chat) on Facebook, [[after the fact]] thinking about what the discussion was about and what would be a good title for the summary page.
- Similar in that they are "inclusive after the fact."
