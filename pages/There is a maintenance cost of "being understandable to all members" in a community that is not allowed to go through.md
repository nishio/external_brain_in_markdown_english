from [/villagepump/ in a community where throughness is not allowed, there is a maintenance cost of "being understandable to all members"](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/ in a community where throughness is not allowed, there is a maintenance cost of "being understandable to all members").
from  [[Communities that are allowed to go through]]
There is a maintenance cost of "being understandable to all members" in a community that is not allowed to go through
- N: Hypothesis: In a community where no through traffic is allowed, there is a maintenance cost of "being understandable to all members".
- T: [[panel discussion not interesting enough]].

- N: ref. [[no need to guess the well chatter]].
- T: Uh, [[group soliloquy]].
- N: The conversation that took place a year ago was "[[rehashed]]" in the wake of this story
    - When this style of communication is happening, the desire for "[[immediate response]]" goes down.
    - (or only those who have gone down remain in the community).

- T: In an instant, I can say "Oh, I get it" or "I see, I see, I see," or I can just go along with the conversation even if I don't understand the meaning of what is being said.
    - Asynchronous, you have to take meaning. [[Asynchronous communication is hard for people who can't take meaning.]] And asynchronous is hard when you don't want to use your head.
    - On the other hand, I understand (or don't understand) I may not be a good communicator.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
- N: uke!
- T: ↑asynchronous but synchronous-like w
- N: If you can't take in the meaning, it must be hard for you to think and look things up slowly, even in synchronous communication. w
    - With that explanation, it looks like you can only say "[[I see]]" without knowing what it means.
- T: Many people can't make sense of it! That's why we have Japanese as a test subject!
    - People say, "I see" even if they don't know what it means!
        - I see!<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon' alt='/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon' height="19.5"/>
- N: I see()
- T: That's still fine for synchronous communication.
- N: The theory that they just assume it's okay because they don't run the checking process to see if it's okay.
- T: If the checking process doesn't run, then it's okay at that point, for that person.
- N: If you originally intended to have a chat for the purpose of [[grooming]], that's fine.
    - What is the point of having a useful discussion, when in reality it's just a catch-all of unintelligible words and [[A case of saying "I see" while thinking I don't understand what you mean...]] is sterile... no, it's not. Is it possible as grooming?
- T: It's a great grooming. [It's a good cosmetic action that makes you feel like you're using your head even though it's a meaningless conversation.
