title: "When everyone else is beating the bad guys, we join them in beating them."

> Let's say, for example, that Mr. A got very flamed. I read a lot of information and it seems that Mr. A is quite at fault. The more information I find out, the angrier and angrier I get.
>
>  So, if you look on Twitter, everyone feels the same way, and there are a lot of people blasting Mr. A. It's trending and more people are shitting on it than I can see.
>
>  You follow the trend and condemn in strong terms along with [[a sense of]] justice. It is socially unacceptable and I feel the criticism is deserved. You have received several likes on your post, and almost all of the replies and RTs are favorable to your post.
>
>  So... After a while, when I had completely forgotten that I had made such a post, I receive a complaint. [[defamation]]. They want 5 million yen in damages.

>  "Why only me? "Why just me?" Why not everyone else?" In the first place, it's the person who did it that is at fault," but that hardly works in a court of law. It is judged on the basis of whether or not the post is defamatory. The court will judge the case based on whether the post is defamatory or not.

In general, [[saying the same opinion as everyone else]] does not create value, but [[those who want to be in the majority]] may be more afraid of [[being in the minority]] rather than [[creating value]].
The more you hit them, the more afraid you are of being hit and the more tangled up you become.
