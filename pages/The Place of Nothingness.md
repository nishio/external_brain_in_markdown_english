Geitaro Nishida's [[Nishida]] idea that the [[limit]] of the particular is [[individual (in philosophy)]] and the limit of the general is "the place of nothingness" when considering the particular and the general [[both extremes]]. What "is" X entails a place Y in the form of "X is in Y." If Y is, it entails a place Z. If Y is, it entails a place Z. If Y is, it entails a place Z. If X is, it entails a place Y. If there is a limit in the direction of this generalization, it can only be nothing, because if it is something, then there is something beyond it.

In the mathematical metaphor of the number line, this is "The small extreme of the natural number line is zero. Then what is the extreme on the large side? For any natural number X, there is a natural number X+1 that is larger than X+1. For any natural number X, there is a larger natural number X+1, so the "larger extreme" cannot be a natural number. In order to deal with such a concept, mathematics introduced the concept "[[infinity]] ∞" to describe something larger than any number.
