title: "I need to organize what to say at the midterm presentation."
---

I was starting to feel more and more "unsure," and I wasn't even sure what I didn't understand, so I consulted Keicho.
- I was wondering if I should translate the tutorial into Japanese before the interim presentation.
- Tutorials will be made available in multiple languages after the implementation of the main functions is complete and the UI and explanations are stable, which is not now.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know what to say at the midterm presentation, so I want to talk about it and organize it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "interim presentation" is this "interim presentation"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Take a 10 minute video and talk about the project you're working on.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "project" is this "project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Project to create digital stationery to organize thoughts by rearranging pieces of information
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "project"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe they did the first user test yesterday and then started to get confused.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "user test" is this "user test"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Have someone who has never used it at all try it and observe the process.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the "process"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Operate the tool while reading the tutorial written in English.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "tutorial" is this "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I made this version because the previous version was complicated and hard to explain how to start using it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "start" is that "start"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>üëçTutorial
(This was actually pressed in the middle of writing the "start" answer, mistaking it for a predictive conversion.)

- >  Read the tutorial written in English and operate the tool.
- Is there anything else about this "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's the hard part: to know how to move a kozane, it must first be added, but if you don't know what it does, you won't even try to add it. We put that in order in the tutorial.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where can I find that "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's the first thing you see when you access the site.

- How do you know this "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I don't know much. I somehow made it in English. Should I be able to switch to Japanese? Some said it would be good to have an operation video.

- Where can I find this "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Must there be another content before the tutorial to motivate people to read and use the tutorial?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What does that "tutorial" look like?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We changed what used to be a precipice into stairs, but the stairs don't make people climb, they just make it easier than the cliff for those who want to climb.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "precipice" is this "precipice"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Back to the interim presentation, this isn't about recruiting new people to use this tool, it's about talking about the project and accelerating the project's future progress.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Maybe we are aiming for too many values at the same time. One is that the more people who use the tool and give feedback, the better the tool will be, and the more people who learn about the project and give feedback, the faster the project will accelerate. They are very similar, but they are different.

- >  Must there be other content before the tutorial to motivate people to read and use the tutorial?
- What is the relationship between these "tutorials" and "projects"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Separate item. Should we make a Japanese version before the interim presentation due to negative comments about the tutorial being in English? I thought so, but this is different. The interim presentation is an introduction to the project, not a solicitation to get people to start using the tool.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen regarding that "tutorial"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If we disregard the cost, it would be nice if it could be translated into multiple languages and switched. I was wondering if we should do this now, but it is not something that needs to be done at this time. It is not something that needs to be done at this time. It should be done after the implementation of the main functions is completed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen in the "tutorial" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The UI and what is talked about in the tutorials also needs to be stabilized. As we add features in the future, menus, etc. will change.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>As for the "tutorial," can it be done?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We can do it later, not now.
