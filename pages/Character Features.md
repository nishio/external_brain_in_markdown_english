title: "Character Features"
---

Even if you simply set a character to [[distributed representation]], if you end up with a character you have never seen before, it will be set to [[unknown language]] (unknown character).
If you convert it to features and create a distributed representation from it, even unknown characters would be okay.

What feature values can be obtained?
- alphabetization
- A-Z.
- capitalization
- symbolization
- full-width digit
- cursive Japanese syllabary used primarily for native Japanese words (esp. function words, inflections, etc.)
- angular Japanese syllabary used primarily for loanwords
- turning a kanji into a numerical value (e.g. "kanji" is up + down + sideways)
    - radical (of a kanji character)
