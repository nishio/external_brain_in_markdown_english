Possibility that "[[low turnout]]" is not the problem
from [/tkgshn/voter turnout in DAOs](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/voter turnout in DAOs).
- There is also a philosophy like [[It's politics that moves what can't be forked.]], like "You don't have to vote in the first place!" It's possible that "low voter turnout!" is not even an issue.
    - But I wonder if it's important to [[represent]] what's useful, even though some of the decision-making for [[good public goods]] is done by machines to a certain extent.
        - I'm under the impression that [[DeCartography]] exists for that purpose.
        - After all, "What would [[the vote move]]?" The question, "Will [[TVL]]?
            - [[What is being moved when voting on something that can be forked (DAO) is only TVL if the asset is as liquid as possible. Similar to mobile voting or something]]
