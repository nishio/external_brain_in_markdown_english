This is a PUBLIC REPO
- In fact, there are data converted from books in the local file system and PDFs in the first place.
- These cannot be placed in a public repo due to copyright
- But data should also be put in repo (as file storage that can be read from Devin).
- [[Separation of tools and data]]


TODO
- Let Devin sort out the current not so organized situation.


I tried to put everything on GitHub in a messy way, but the file size exceeded the limit.
- that's so
- PDFs are originally in Dropbox.
