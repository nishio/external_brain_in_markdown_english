title: "Landing abstract concepts on concrete facts"
---

- AI can help [[land]] [[Abstract Concepts]] on [concrete facts
Specific examples from [[The Third Fusion in Japanese History]].
- [https://chat.openai.com/share/e86c2403-e2e9-4853-a32d-95d6e64ef0d8](https://chat.openai.com/share/e86c2403-e2e9-4853-a32d-95d6e64ef0d8)
- After the concept "we are the third time," which seemed to be useful in an abstract layer, was created, we tried to apply it directly to AI
    - > Review what happened the first two times and apply it to the third time.
- but gave an answer that made no sense.
    - I guess I'll have to delve into why I'm feeling this non-verbal sense of "streakiness" later.
            - [[Polanyi's tacit knowledge]] on the flip side, getting a "sense of not being close"
- In response, I let the AI list the relevant specifics.
    - > List what historical events occurred in the first two sessions.

### Relation to related fragments
.
This note is related to the fragments "[Is accuracy lost when you reduce the level of abstraction?", "Digging down to specifics", "The importance of 'digging down' and 'building up' knowledge", "Digging down and circular references", "Exploration Net (fireworks) study group", " The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production: A Reaction Summary," "Jiro Kawakita Doesn't Tell Us to Abstract," "An Experiment to Make GPT4 Supplement Context," and "nishio.icon" are all relevant. These fragments discuss the importance of putting abstract concepts into concrete facts, how to do so, and the results.

### deep thinking
[[Putting abstract concepts into concrete facts]] is important to deepen understanding and to apply knowledge to real phenomena. However, in the process, information may be reduced and generality may be lost. Therefore, an appropriate balance between abstract concepts and concrete facts must be maintained.
