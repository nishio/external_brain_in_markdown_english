It is a concept that defines [[information]] as "well-structured, meaningful data. It also distinguishes "semantic information" that also satisfies truthfulness requirements. This is an attempt to redefine information as not just data, but as something with structure, meaning, and truthfulness, and is an important basic theory that underpins Floridi's entire [[information philosophy]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Floridi's GDI considers "appropriately structured and meaningful data" as "information," of which those that satisfy truthfulness are called "semantic information. JTB (Justified True Belief), on the other hand, is a traditional formulation that considers "[[Justified True Beliefs]]" to be "[[knowledge]].
- The relationship between the two is taken broadly,
    - Truth (True)
        - The requirement that Floridi's semantic information be true overlaps with JTB's "True".
        - [[justification]] （Justified）
        - GDI does not include "justification" since it is the definition of "information".
        - The JTB emphasizes the importance of how beliefs are justified in order to discuss "knowledge".
    - Belief
        - GDI is a theory that questions the nature of information and is disconnected from the "belief" state of the receiver; JTB assumes belief.
In general, it can be understood that there is a relationship between Floridi's GDI, which is a framework for defining "(true) semantic information," and the JTB, which in addition incorporates "justification" and "subject beliefs" to complete it as "knowledge.

Floridi attempted to clarify the traditional ambiguous concepts surrounding "information" and to highlight the nature of information and its philosophical and ethical implications by clarifying elements such as data, meaning, and truthfulness. Specifically, by distinguishing between mere data and "semantic information" (information that is true and meaningful), the aim is to lay the groundwork for more precise discussions on how information leads to knowledge and the impact of information on society and ethics.
