title: "Why Politics Fails"
---

> [tumada](https://x.com/tumada/status/1825048657852313728) "Why [[politics]] Fails", a book that I highly recommend tech people read. How software can (and cannot) contribute to politics, freedom and equality, [[redistribution]], civic councils and prosperity, entrepreneurial policy, climate change, etc. It's an easy read and a good book, but unfairly low reviews on Amazon...
