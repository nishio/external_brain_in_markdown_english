title: "Will/can/must and project adoption"
---

from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 2021-05-06]]

I thought there was a relationship between will/can/must and project adoption. Also, I thought these three were low resolution and should be separated more.
- I recently talked about [[Will/Can/Must and Agile]] on Twitter.
- In relation to this, I have reorganized the [[Will/Can/Must]] statements that were written in the past.
    - I also noted that it's not a monolithic concept and there are swings in usage.

    - Feelings on the part of the mentor
            - [[Strong/interesting/important/willing to cooperate]]
    - were written independently of each other.
- Aren't these three interrelated?

- summary
    - Project proposals are [[Will/Can/Must]]. It is important that this Must be voluntarily set.
    - The project with the largest "Want to adopt" (Will) in Nishio will be adopted. The strength of the Will is determined by the compatibility between the proposal's Will/Can/Must and Nishio's Will/Can/Must.
