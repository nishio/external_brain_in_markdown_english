---

Talking face to face on [[Zoom]] is a mental model of face-to-face conversation.
    - [[Metaphors for face-to-face dialogue]]

[[LINKLET]] is a mental model for doing [group work
- Because we don't look at each other's faces, but rather at the object of our work, we talk to each other.

- [[mob-pro]], etc., "sharing a screen and having a conversation while looking at it" is similarly a conversation while looking at the object of work.

Instead of "working alone on a digital object and then showing it to others after it has taken shape," it is more efficient for the team as a whole to "share the screen, show the work process, and get quick feedback.
This is the flow of change in Cybozu, from PairPro to MobPro to mob work such as documents and lecture materials, and in this context, LINKLET is a tool to support "mob physical work".

The reason why mobpro is beneficial is because [[Means of sharing information without verbalization]].
The implicit dissatisfaction that I feel with "groupware that can't be used unless it's verbalized" is expressed in the form of choosing to do it with MobPro.

- [[remote collaboration]]
