title: "Over-qualified so that anyone can do it"

There's a leap of logic in "it can't be just one person who can do it -> everyone should be able to do it."

There is a significant risk to [[Business Continuity]] if there is only one person in the organization who can perform a given task."

To avoid this risk, "let's make sure anyone can do the work" is [[over-quality]].
If two or three people can do it, it is sufficient.

Allocating excessive costs for excessive quality is a harmful business decision.
