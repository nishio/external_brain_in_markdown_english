The pages were considered as a fluid process rather than one with fixed content; Nishio's fragments "the process by which sentences are created" and "the process by which stories are produced" are related to this idea. He also submitted the hypothesis that "project pages must be re-created on a regular basis. This is based on the idea that the content of pages should not be fixed, but constantly updated and improved.

Nishio's fragment "Wiki as a living text" and "circularly closed pages (birth process)" are also related to this idea: the Wiki is in a state of "unfinished writing," which allows a process of "continuous improvement. Also, when ideas develop on a time axis, they become one-dimensional, but by closing them in a circle, new perspectives and connections become visible.

These considerations lead to the conclusion that the representation of knowledge and information should not be fixed, but fluid, constantly being updated and improved. The process should also be multidimensional, not one-dimensional. This is because knowledge and information are formed from fragmentary elements, which are combined and superimposed to create new meaning and value.

- [[process]], [[flow]], and [[nominalization]] are discussed. Instead of assuming that fixed content exists at the time the page is created, we consider the page as a fluid process, with no fixed content.

Nishio's fragment "process by which sentences are created" and "process by which stories are produced" are related to this idea. Sentences and stories are also not fixed, but are formed by the combination of fragmentary elements, which are then superimposed after the fact.

We also submitted the hypothesis that project pages should be reworked on a regular basis. This is based on the idea that page content should not be fixed, but constantly updated and improved.

Nishio's fragment "Wiki as a living text" and "circularly closed pages (birth process)" are also related to this idea: the Wiki is in a state of "unfinished writing," which allows a process of "continuous improvement.

Page as a fluid process
- [[process]], [[flow]], [[nominalization]].
It would assume that fixed content exists on the page when the page is created.
Since most books are so
Page as a fluid process with no fixed content
