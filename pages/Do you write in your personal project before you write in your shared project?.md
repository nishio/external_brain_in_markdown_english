title: "Do you write in your personal project before you write in your shared project?"

I think I'll create myself in my personal project before I write to [/villagepump/well](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/well).
    - [[Originality first before co-creation]] は「何を作るか不明瞭なまま、一緒にやる人を募集すること」に対する話<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - On the other hand, what's being discussed on this page is about "verbalizing thoughts that have not yet been clearly verbalized."
        - These two are different.
    - When writing the language, do you write for a one-person project or a multi-person project?
        - A feeling that it doesn't matter which way you go.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
            - I feel that "it should be done as a one-person project" is not a good idea because it adds unnecessary restrictions on output.
        - Even in <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>, which is mainly used for one-person projects, there is often a pattern of "write on Facebook and then reprint" or "write on Twitter and then reprint" if you observe carefully
            - I wonder at what point they do that. I'll give it some thought.
                - Do you do this when you don't have some coherent amount of text in you, and you want the feeling of sending it in segments?
                    - Unlike stationery like Scrapbox, where you can rewrite freely anytime you want, by using stationery that "cannot be changed after writing and sending (or can be changed, but it's a bit of a hassle)", are you forcing output by preventing "over-editing"?
                - I don't think I'm looking for that much of a response from others.
                - Used when you have enough to write about to be able to post a series of tweets.
                    - When you don't even have that.
                        - I need to organize my thoughts on what to do with ~..."
                        - I use [[Keicho]] in these situations.
