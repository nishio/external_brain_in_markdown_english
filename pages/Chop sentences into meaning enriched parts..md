- The process of stripping away relationships in a text
    - Elements whose particles indicate their relationship
    - How much of the particle should be stripped off, moderate?
    - [[Granularity of sticky notes]] is also important
    - A few one-word items are okay, but if they are all you have, it will interfere with grouping.
    - Short sentences of moderate length are good.
    - How should we determine the granularity of sticky notes to achieve the most effective results?

### Digest of Research Notes
.

We are exploring ways to carve sentences into meaning enriched parts. Our goal is to develop a function to generate long sentences into reasonably short sticky notes. To do this, we need to strip away the relationships in the sentence, and particles are an important element of these relationships. The granularity of the sticky notes is also important. A few one-word ones are fine, but if they are all that is needed, grouping will be hindered. We believe that short sentences of moderate length are better.

I also found a connection with Nishio's research notes "lowering the hurdle to writing", "the ability to chop long sentences", and "the granularity of sticky notes". These are deeply related to my research, and we may be able to find more effective methods by referring to his ideas.

On the other hand, however, the "de-"excerpting" theory does not seem to be directly related to my research. It advocates finding and recording the union of knowledge in books and one's own knowledge, while my research focuses on inscribing sentences into parts.

All of this raises the following questions.
- How much of the particle should be stripped away to achieve a reasonable moderation?
- How should the granularity of the stickies be determined to achieve the most effective results?
- How can I incorporate Nishio's ideas into my research?

We believe that by addressing these questions, we can find more effective ways to componentize the text.
