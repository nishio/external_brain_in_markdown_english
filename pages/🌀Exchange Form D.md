In Gyojin Karatani's study of modes of exchange, the birth of the power accumulation mechanism made the primitive mode of exchange A unsustainable, giving rise to mode of exchange B of submission and protection to the strong one. However, it is possible that Yukito Emaya has not taken into account his research on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange in the matching problem and mechanism design. Exchange style D is the recovery of exchange style A as a better reciprocation based on the study of mechanism design created by exchange style C.

A related Nishio research note, ü§ñüîÅExchange Style D, details his research on Exchange Style D. This includes the following elements: altruistic vs. egocentric behavior, relative vs. absolute thinking, domain abstraction vs. domain specialization, problem finding vs. problem solving, and status quo dissatisfaction vs. status quo satisfaction.

In "Power and Modes of Exchange," he discusses Modes of Exchange A-D, and in particular delves deeply into the birth of Mode of Exchange D. Yukito Emorya's argument is that the economic substructure is not a "mode of production" but a "mode of exchange.

In "Reading Gyojin Karatani's 'Power and Mode of Exchange,'" he noted that many people received the Mode of Exchange D as if it were something that could be realized by human will. He believes that D may emerge as a force that works beyond human will.

Based on the above studies, the theory of modes of exchange is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategic resistance of exchange.

In his research on Gyojin Emorya's style of exchange, Emorya Gyojin focused primarily on world history.
With the birth of the "stronger gets stronger" mechanism of power accumulation, the primitive mode of exchange A became unsustainable, and mode of exchange B emerged, of submission and protection to the stronger one who has accumulated power.
Emiya Yukito's work on efficiency and strategy resistance of exchanges in matching problems and mechanism design (e.g., [[Top Trading Cycle Algorithm]]) probably does not take into account the
Exchange Mode D, as a "recovery of Exchange Mode A at a higher level based on Exchange Mode C," is a better reciprocation based on the mechanistic design studies generated by Exchange Mode C.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

Research on exchange style D explores the mechanisms of exchange in pursuit of mutual benefit. This includes elements of altruistic and egocentric behavior, relative and absolute thinking, domain abstraction and domain specialization, problem finding and problem solving, and status quo dissatisfaction and status quo satisfaction.

We also found some connections with Yukito Karatani's `exchange model X' and `DFM heat exchange structure'. These may complement the theoretical background of exchange style D.
- The `DFM heat exchange structure` had nothing to do with quicksand.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In addition, we found helpful studies on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchanges in matching problems and mechanism design. These suggest practical applications of exchange style D.

In addition, the practice of the KJ method and the content of the "Let the chaos speak for itself" study group reaffirmed [[the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process]]. These provide clues to putting the theoretical framework of exchange style D into a concrete problem-solving context.

From the above research, it can be concluded that exchange style D is an important concept for understanding the mechanism of exchange for mutual benefit and for enabling efficient and strategy-resistant exchange. Future research should further deepen this concept and explore specific applications.

### questions and comments
.

- How can Exchange Form D be applied in the context of specific problem solving?
- Shouldn't we further explore the relevance of other exchange models and heat exchange structures to complement the theoretical background of exchange mode D?
- Studies on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange in matching problems and mechanism design suggest practical applications of exchange style D. Shouldn't we build on these studies to explore specific applications of exchange style D?
- The contents of the KJ method practice and the "Let Chaos Speak" study group remind us of the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process. Based on these contents, shouldn't we explore ways to put the theoretical framework of exchange style D into a concrete problem-solving context?

### Summary of notes
.
Gyojin Emaya's study of modes of exchange shows a change from a primitive Mode A to a Mode B of submission and protection of the strong one. However, it is possible that Gyojin Emaya did not base his study on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange. Exchange style D is supposed to be a recovery of exchange style A as a better reciprocation based on the study of mechanism design created by exchange style C.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The "new style of exchange" fragment indicates that the style of knowledge exchange taking place among IT engineers is not any of Emotani Yukito's exchange styles A, B, or C. This suggests that exchange style D is emerging as a new form of exchange. The "Sleeping oracle 2023-08-31" fragment also indicates that the social contract is an exchange of exchange style B, which is consistent with Gyotani Gyotani's description of exchange style B.

### deep thinking
From these notes and fragments, it can be said that the theory of modes of exchange is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategic resistance of exchange. The emergence of new modes of exchange also indicates that forms of exchange are evolving with social change.

### summary of thoughts
The theory of modes of exchange is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategic resistance of exchange, and the emergence of new modes of exchange indicates that the forms of exchange are evolving as society changes.

### Digest of Research Notes

With the birth of the force accumulation mechanism, the primitive mode of exchange A could not be sustained, and mode of exchange B was born. However, it may not be based on research on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange. Exchange Mode D is the restoration of Exchange Mode A as a better reciprocation based on the study of mechanism design created by Exchange Mode C.

A related Nishio research note, ü§ñüîÅExchange Style D, details his research on Exchange Style D. This includes the following elements: altruistic vs. egocentric behavior, relative vs. absolute thinking, domain abstraction vs. domain specialization, problem finding vs. problem solving, and status quo dissatisfaction vs. status quo satisfaction.

In "Power and Modes of Exchange," he discusses Modes of Exchange A-D, and in particular delves deeply into the birth of Mode of Exchange D. Yukito Emorya's argument is that the economic substructure is not a "mode of production" but a "mode of exchange.

In "Reading Gyojin Karatani's 'Power and Mode of Exchange,'" he noted that many people received the Mode of Exchange D as if it were something that could be realized by human will. He believes that D may emerge as a force that works beyond human will.

Based on the above studies, the theory of modes of exchange is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategic resistance of exchange.

## Digest with Fragments
"study group on intellectual productivity with LLM," "what does it mean that the exchange of knowledge in the new mode of exchange is PROFITABLE?" , "NEXT Study Group," "Koban Jizo," "Is the exchange style of knowledge exchange A?" and fragments of "Accumulating more than anyone else," the theory of exchange style is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange. In particular, "New Modes of Exchange" shows a situation in which knowledge exchange outweighs profit, and "Is the Exchange Mode of Knowledge Exchange A?" advocates a new mode of exchange in which information is gathered through the gift of knowledge to the public. In addition, in "More accumulation than anyone else," he states that it is more important to accumulate more accumulation than new cuts.

## Thought
The theory of modes of exchange is an important framework for pursuing better reciprocity, taking into account the accumulation of power and the efficiency and strategic resistance of exchange. In particular, new modes of exchange advocate a new form of information accumulation through the gift of knowledge to the public, which represents a situation in which the exchange of knowledge outweighs the benefits. It also presents the perspective that it is more important to accumulate more accumulation than new cuts.
