If you're going to do a "thought experiment," you have to emphasize that it's a thought experiment that has nothing to do with the case in front of you.

>  Are you going to test by throwing a lot of [[anomalous data]] into the production environment? If you want to experiment, why don't you create a [[virtual environment]] and do it there? I'm talking about that.

>  Let's create a test environment with LLM and test there.
