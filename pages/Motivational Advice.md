title: "Motivational Advice"
---

Nishio has been offering this experimental [web service](http://www.nhiro.org/yaruki/#) since 2013.

# Purpose
.
- This system is provided free of charge as part of a study of software to increase human [[productivity]], focusing on "problems that do not produce [willingness (e.g., to do something)" to propose solutions and collect data on their success rates. The system is provided free of charge to collect data on the success rate of proposed solutions.
- Monitoring yourself is difficult. When I am in a bad situation, the person monitoring me is also in a bad situation. It is not possible to deal with it appropriately. So we replace this with software.

# Mechanisms
- There are two modes: "Counseling Mode" and "One-Click Advice. Counseling Mode is a system that encourages you to become aware of your condition by repeatedly asking you questions to ascertain your condition. This is recommended.
- On the other hand, some people in a "no motivation" state "don't even feel like answering questions. For such people, there is a system that provides one-click advice without questions. This one is less accurate than the counseling mode.
- All of your responses will be recorded. We will gratefully use them for future research. Here is an example of what we have learned thanks to your responses: 30% of those who are unmotivated are trying to do "too big a task" that will not be completed in 4 hours. Of those, 50% are asking, "What is the one thing I have to do in the next 25 minutes from now?" When asked, they can verbalize. And when you say, "Well, let's do that," 40% of them are motivated to do it.
