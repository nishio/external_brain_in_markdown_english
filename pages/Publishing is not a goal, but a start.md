title: "Publishing is not a goal, but a start"

It is important to think of publication and debriefing sessions as a start, not a goal. This is,[[成果を出した後も改善や進化を続けるべきである]]という意味である。ソフトウェア開発においても、[[リリース後のバージョンアップが重要]]であり、書籍においても[[増補改訂版]]の出版が考えられる。また、未踏ユースの採択や成果報告会もゴールではなく、その後の経験や自信、[[コミュニティへの貢献]]などを通じて[[社会に還元する]]スタートである。これらの活動は、自分が返し終わったと思ったら終わりとすることができるが、その還元は一生続けるべきであるとも考えられる。<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/omni/icon' alt='omni.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

### Digest of Research Notes
.

It is important to think of publication and results reporting meetings as a start, not a goal. This means that improvements and evolution should continue even after results are achieved. In software development, it is also important to upgrade versions of software after release, and in books, publication of revised and expanded editions is also possible. In addition, the adoption of an unexplored youth program and the debriefing of the results are not the goal, but rather the start of giving back to society through subsequent experience, confidence, and contributions to the community. These activities can be considered to be over when one feels one has finished giving back, but it can also be considered that the giving back should continue throughout one's life.

Another problem is that if the goal is not clear, it is difficult to know which way to go. This is also true in the publishing industry, where publishers may be wiped out if the incentive to publish disappears. Therefore, it is important for the publishing industry to lower the hurdle for writing book-length manuscripts and to introduce a variety of projects and new authors.

In light of the above, it is important to take the viewpoint that goal setting for publications and results reporting sessions is not an end in itself, but a new beginning. In addition, clarity and flexibility are required in goal setting.

### Questions/observations
.
- Is the idea of starting with a publication or results briefing applicable to any situation or industry?
- How should problems be solved if the goal is not clear and the direction of progress is not clear?
- What are some ways to lower the hurdles to writing book-length manuscripts in the publishing industry?
- What specific methods can be considered for giving back to society after the adoption of the "Unexplored Youth" program and the results debriefing session?
