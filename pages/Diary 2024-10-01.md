- It's been a while since I've seen [[Ability has no market value.]] I wondered about [[employment (long term)]] when it comes to contracting and quasi-contracting.
Hiring is the "I'm not clear yet what you're going to tell me to do, but sell it to me in bulk for 1,600 hours, 200 days a year" version of quasi-contracting.
Looks like the difference between [[spot instance]] and [[reserved instance]].
I have a feeling that employers use employment contracts in different ways.

In this context, the instructions on what kind of work to do are flexible, and the image is similar to that of a long-term, stable resource. The metaphor of the difference between spot instances and reserved instances is also apt.

I feel employment and entrepreneurship are false dichotomies.
Even if they are hired, there will be some additional constraints and access to some non-marketable resources.
It ultimately takes an entrepreneurial spirit to achieve better results in that situation.
Ah, well, there's a sense of conflict when it's "employed by an existing company" or "create a new company yourself," but entrepreneurship is just useful regardless of your position in the first place.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Depending on how you work within employment, you will often be required to be entrepreneurial enough to see that it is not a simple dichotomy. It is very important to think that being employed by a company is not just "[[stability]]," but that you can create value with an entrepreneurial spirit while taking advantage of the constraints and access rights that come with it.

- [[Put only good things in vaguely defined words.]]

- [[Group Size and Collective Decision Making]]

- [[About "The Wrong Two]]
- I'd like to illustrate.
    - I'm stopping at the thought stopping brought about by the language, but I have a feeling it's going to be further subdivided when I delve into the specifics.
    - Specifically, "[[column and row are false dichotomies]]" is a different pattern than before.
Read back.
- [[I want to improve the resolution of false dichotomies.]]
