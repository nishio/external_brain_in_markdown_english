title: "identity"

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It seems to me that the katakana word "identity" in Japanese has two very different nuanced aspects, and it would be good to have a different name for each. Consider this point.

Japanese "identity" may include two different aspects as follows:
    - [[self-identity]]
    - It refers to the inner sense or consistency of being that one perceives as "being oneself.
    - It is close to the original meaning of "[[identity]]" in philosophy and psychology.
    - E.g., "selfhood" or "state of self-consistency".

- social identity
    - It refers to the [[sense of belonging]] or external recognition that comes from a relationship with a group or culture.
    - The emphasis is on social aspects such as "who you are perceived as" and "which group you belong to."
    - Examples: nationality, occupation, gender, role of faith, etc.

To distinguish between them, we can suggest the following designations
- Self-identity → "internal identity"
    - (Emphasizes self-consciousness and consistency)
- Social identity → "external identity"
    - (Emphasizes relationships with groups and recognition by others)

By organizing in this way, we can reduce ambiguity in daily life and in discussions, and deepen the discussion according to each aspect.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the English-speaking world, "identity" is classified into two main aspects

- Personal Identity
    - It refers to how an individual perceives himself or herself and feels uniqueness and consistency. It relates to self-concept and self-awareness and is based on one's own internal characteristics and experiences, not on comparisons with others.

- Social Identity
    - It refers to the perception that an individual belongs to a particular social group or category. It is associated with a sense of belonging to a social role or group, such as nationality, occupation, religion, or gender, and is formed in the context of relationships with others and in the social context.

These distinctions are widely discussed in the fields of psychology and sociology and are considered important for understanding individual behavior and social interactions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Indeed, in English, "identity" is also used to mean ID card or identification card. In this case, "identity" has the following nuances

1. legal and official identity
    - Official proof that an individual is recognized as belonging to a particular country or organization.
    - Passport, driver's license, ID card, etc. are applicable.
    - Refers to an individual as a "registered entity" certified by a state or organization.

- Digital Identity for authentication
    - It means an "identity" on the Internet and in the digital environment, recognized through login credentials and digital certificates.
    - E.g., authentication with user accounts or blockchain.

Thus, the word "identity" is used not only in relation to self and society, but also in the sense of official status or authentication, and thus the nuance varies greatly depending on the context.

If the translation of "identity" in Japanese includes these, it may be better to use another word such as "identity," "authentication," or "personal information" to avoid confusion.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the Chinese-speaking world, there is an active debate on "身份认同" (identity). This concept is mainly viewed in the following two aspects

- Self-identification
    - It refers to how an individual perceives his or her own uniqueness and coherence. It is closely related to an individual's sense of self and self-esteem in psychology and sociology.

- Social identity
    - It refers to the perception that an individual belongs to a particular social group or category. It is associated with a sense of belonging to a social role or group, such as nationality, occupation, religion, or gender, and is formed in the context of relationships with others and in the social context.

These distinctions are widely discussed in Chinese-speaking academia and society as important for understanding individual behavior and social interactions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In Chinese, official identification is expressed in the following terms

1. shēnfèn rènzhèng
    - It refers to the authentication of identity in general.
    - It means confirmation of identification (e.g., ID card, passport, driver's license, etc.) in a public setting.
    - It is also used in digital authentication.
2. shēnfèn yànzhèng (身份验证)
    - Refers to verification of identity.
    - Similar to identity authentication, but focuses specifically on the act of verifying that the identity is correct.
    - Examples: two-step verification for online banking and apps.
3. shímíngzhì (实名制)
    - Refers to a system of real-name registration, which officially registers and authenticates one's identity.
    - This may be required when using the Internet or public services in China.
    - These expressions are used to refer to official identification and authentication processes in a digital environment.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Yes, in Chinese-speaking countries there is a clear distinction between "认同" and "认证". The differences are as follows

1. rèntóng
    - Meaning: "recognition and identification" in identity.
    - Usage: Used in the context of how an individual or group perceives and agrees with themselves and their relationships with others.
    - Examples: cultural identification (文化的アイデンティティ), social identification (社会的アイデンティティ)
    - Nuance: psychological and internal identification or belonging.

2. rènzhèng
    - Meaning: "authentication" of an identity or qualification.
    - Usage: Used in official or formal situations to confirm or prove identity or credentials.
    - Examples: 身份认证(身分認証), 资格认证(資格認証)
    - Nuance: procedural and institutional act of confirmation.

Point of distinction
- While 认同 focuses on subjective and internal "identification" or "belongingness", 认证 implies objective and external "proof" or "confirmation".

Example: The
我对这份工作有认同感 (I feel empathy for this work)
You need to authenticate your identity."
This distinction helps to organize the discussion and may be helpful to clearly separate "identity" from "identity authentication" in Japanese.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In authentication and authorization protocols such as OpenID, there is a clear distinction between Authentication ([[Certification]]) and Authorization ([[Authorization]]). These distinctions are related to the difference between 认同 (認同) and 认证 (認証) in the Chinese language mentioned earlier, and to the different aspects of "identity" in Japanese.

- Authentication
    - Meaning: The process of verifying that the identity claimed by a user is correct.
    - Examples: login with username and password, biometrics, two-factor authentication, etc.
    - Related: equivalent to 认证 (認証) in Chinese, the act of officially confirming or certifying an individual's identity.

- Authorization
    - Meaning: The process of checking and authorizing whether an authenticated user is authorized to access a particular resource or function.
    - Examples: access rights to files and databases, permission to use certain functions and services.
    - Related: Chinese 授权 (授権), to grant a user a specific operation or access.

Relationships and Contexts

Relation to aspects of identity:.
- Authentication is the process of verifying the external identity of a user and is directly related to 认证.
- Authorization is the process of managing what role and authority (social identity) a user has within an organization or system, equivalent to the Chinese word 授权 (授権).

Comparison with Chinese 认同 (認同):.
- 认同 refers to an individual's internal sense of self-awareness and belonging, and has no direct relationship to the technical process of authentication or authorization.
- However, the sense of identity and belonging that users feel toward an organization or service can have an indirect impact on the design of security policies and access privileges.

Application in the context of OpenID
- OpenID is a protocol that primarily provides authentication. It allows users to access multiple services with a single login, reducing the need for separate authentication for each service.
- [[OAuth]] is an authorization protocol that allows users to grant and control access to their data and functionality for a particular application or service.

summary
The distinction between Authentication and Authorization refers to the different processes of identification and authorization in a technical context.
These correspond to the concepts of "认证" and "授权" in Chinese and "[[official identity authentication]]" and "[[social role]] / [[authority]]" in Japanese.
In discussing identity, it is important to distinguish between the technical authentication and authorization process and the psychological and social self-perception ("认同" or "internal identity"), which allows for clearer understanding and communication.
