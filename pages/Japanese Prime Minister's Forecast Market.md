> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1972215105908887908) [[prediction market]] [[Polymarket]], more than 100 million yen has been invested in the question of predicting the next prime minister of Japan, and yet the Japanese people in question are not interested. It is not interesting that the Japanese cannot participate because it would be online gambling, so I put the same question on the prediction market [[Manifold]], which is not a gambling market.
