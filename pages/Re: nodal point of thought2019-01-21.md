- This article explores [[the process of thinking]] and [[the process of association]] in depth, and discusses [[the difference between drawing and text]] and the role of [[metaphor]]. In particular, it focuses on how [[metaphor]] forms [[abstract networks]] such as "[[metaphorical space]]" and [[connects different concepts]].
- What is interesting here is how [[the different means of output, "drawing" and "writing"]] affect thinking. He states that [[drawing allows people to freely connect ideas without one-dimensional constraints]], and that this encourages more flexible thinking than text. This perspective suggests the power of visualization as a thinking tool.
- He also mentions that the translation process functions as "[[Slow Reading]]" and encourages [[Conceptual Restructuring]] and [[New Discoveries]]. This "[[slowness]]," he says, creates nodes of thought and triggers [[new connections between existing ideas]].
- As a developmental discussion, these ways of thinking lead to perspectives on how we interact with digital tools and how they can augment human cognitive abilities. as AI and machine learning evolve, how to leverage the importance of these "[[slow thinking]]" and "[[nonlinear associations]]" is an important future research This is an important theme for future research.
