title: "Visualize the contents of the Plurality book with Talk to the City"
---

From a mechanistic point of view, I thought that [[Talk to the City]] could be used not only for visualizing "the opinions of many people" but also for visualizing "the contents of books," so I gave it a try.

Useful?
- Personally, I don't think so.
    - Books convey meaning not just in the fragments themselves, but in their arrangement as well.
    - While it contributes to a "rough idea of what is being said," the book has a "table of contents" maintained by a human being, so it is not a "table of contents.

I just tried 'Talk to the City' using the manuscript of the Plurality book as input data. [https://nishio.github.io/tttc_plurality/](https://nishio.github.io/tttc_plurality/)
