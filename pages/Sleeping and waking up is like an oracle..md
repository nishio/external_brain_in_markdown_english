Going to sleep and waking up is like [oracle
- Write down the fragments of your brain at the moment you wake up before they disappear.
    - Not sure why "[[Voice and Power]]" came up.
    - [[Whatever happens, it is the only thing that should happen.]]
- Not in the form of a sentence.
    - I try to write it out as a sentence first, but it gets stuck.
    - It is more important to write and make it disappear than to finish it in writing
        - [[If you don't write it, it disappears.]]
    - [[oracle that predicts the next day's events]]
