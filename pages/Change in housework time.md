Japan is not included in this study, so there is some question as to whether the measurements are the same, but if they are, that would mean that women's time for housework has been cut in half in other countries, while Japan has remained the same as it was in 1960.

>  An oxford paper on the number of hours of housework for men and women in each country over a 50-year period shows that Japanese women's 240+ hours of housework is itself longer than the total number of hours of housework and childcare for all men and women combined in each country.

>  If, despite the increasing number of people working together in Japan, the average person spends four hours a day doing housework, then correcting the skewed distribution between men and women is obviously a high priority, but it is also important to quit doing housework that is nice to have (nice to have but not necessary) and to lower the "pass level" more and more. I wondered if this was the case.
>  I feel that many people make a big issue of saving money, but have yet to bring the issue of performance and productivity in relation to time to the household chores.
