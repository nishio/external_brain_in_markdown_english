<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/pplx/icon' alt='pplx.icon' height="19.5"/> In Baroque architecture and visual arts, the fold represents a fluid zone that blurs the boundaries between outer and inner, exterior and interior, and fiction and reality. This concept emphasizes the lack of clear demarcation in objects or thoughts, as both permeate each other and are involved in transformative processes where they cannot be separated without losing their identity

The fold represents a fluid realm that blurs the boundaries between the external and the internal, the external and the internal, the fictional and the real. This concept emphasizes that there are no clear divisions between objects and thoughts; they permeate each other and are involved in a process of transformation that cannot be separated without losing their identity.
