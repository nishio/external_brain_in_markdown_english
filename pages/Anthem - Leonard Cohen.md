Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

[[ring a bell that can still ring]]
- [[ringing bells that can be rung]]
        - [[I don't care what I can't control.]]

[[Forget perfection.]]
    - [[People who don't release until it's perfect aren't aiming for perfection.]]

[[There is a rift in everything.]]
- [[light shining through a crack]]
    - [[nageire (casual or nature-imitating style of Japanese floral arrangement)]]
