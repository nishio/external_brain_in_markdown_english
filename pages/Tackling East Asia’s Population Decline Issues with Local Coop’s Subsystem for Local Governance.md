As Japan's population continues to decline and age in rural areas, the crisis of municipal survival is becoming more serious. Therefore, they are trying to build an autonomous and flexible governance system by introducing a "second local government" or "Local Co-op (Local Co-op, [[like a cooperative]])" mechanism that is not only government-led but also led by the local people themselves. Specifically, the main focus of the project is to use NFT to collaborate with external participants (digital residents) to create new funding methods and models for sustainable use of local resources.

Point]

Declining Population and Municipal Crisis
- Many local governments in Japan are facing a crisis of extinction. It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain traditional administrative services.

Local Co-op (Second Local Government) Concept
- A system similar to a "small government," separate from local government, will be established with the residents themselves and outside collaborators.
- A new resident-oriented organization will take over the infrastructure operations (public transportation, garbage collection, etc.) that have been handled by local governments.

Community Building with NFT
- Issue NFTs as [[digital resident cards]] and incorporate people from outside the region as "[[digital villagers]]" to receive financial assistance and support in terms of wisdom and manpower.
- In fact, efforts in rural areas have enabled elderly local residents to obtain outside help.

Maintenance of natural resources and new revenue models
- Raise external funds to conserve satoyama and fishery resources, including logging, reforestation, and trading of carbon credits.
- The company is working to create a mechanism to return the revenue generated by carbon credits and thinning to the community.

Transfer of administrative services and creation of new communities
- Instead of the traditional garbage collection by the government, residents will bring their garbage to the new locations to increase opportunities for interaction.
- The new organization and residents work together to create a cycle of resources, with the municipality entrusting them with the management of the project.

Summary
In Japan's rural areas facing a declining population, efforts have begun to redesign the tasks previously handled by the government as "local co-ops" with residents and outside collaborators. This is a distinctive feature of the project. The goal is to shift from "government-dependent" to "community-driven" governance, and the company intends to expand its application to other countries as well as Japan.

1.[[Second Local Government]] ([[Second Local Government]])
- Description: A new system in which local residents and external collaborators take charge of public services that have become difficult to maintain by existing local governments alone.
- Objective: To break away from government dependence and allow residents to flexibly make decisions and manage resources on their own.
- Example: "Local Co-ops" are beginning to take over public transportation, garbage collection, and other tasks that were previously left to local governments.

2. [[NISHIKIGOI NFT]]
- What it is: NFT is based on Nishikigoi (Nishikigoi), the pride of the Yamakoshi region of Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture.
- Role: Purchasers become "digital villagers" and bring external resources such as money and ideas to the community.
- Effect: Local residents began to think "let's get digital residents to help us" and collaboration with the outside world became more active.

3.[Yamakoshi Village
- Background: Typical mountainous area with depopulation and aging population, further accelerated by the 2004 Chuetsu Earthquake and other factors.
- Initiatives: Attract digital residents (NFT holders) and revitalize the village while utilizing traditional culture and natural resources.
- Change: A culture of being welcomed as "friends" by "outsiders" was created through the visits and assistance of NFT purchasers.

4. [[SINRA]]
- Purpose: A mechanism for earning economic returns through [[carbon credit]] trading and thinning while utilizing natural resources such as forests and oceans.
- Collaboration: Promote a model in which local residents and outside collaborators work together to conserve nature and return the benefits of carbon credits to the community.
- Effectiveness: The project is a new attempt at a virtuous circle between natural regeneration and the local economy.

5.[Extinction risk
- Current situation: About 40% of municipalities in Japan are projected to be at risk of disappearing, making it difficult to maintain social security and infrastructure.
- Problem: Conventional administrative services alone cannot cope with a declining and aging population, and if left unchecked, local communities may collapse.
- Significance: Efforts should be made to increase regional autonomy by continuously attracting outside funding and human resources through a combination of "second municipalities," NFTs, etc.

6. what are villagers' impressions of the NFT?
- Initial reaction: many said "I don't understand blockchain or NFT".
- Change: Digital villagers actually visit and provide tangible help, making them feel that NFT = useful and that they have new friends.
- Future Expectations: People in the community are beginning to accept NFT as a real tool for mutual help and exchange, not just a digital asset.
