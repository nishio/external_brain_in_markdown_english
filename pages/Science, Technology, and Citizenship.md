What is Civic Tech?
- Citizen x Technology Initiatives to Solve Social Issues
- Instead of waiting for the center or government to tell them what to do, residents, researchers, companies, and government work together to share and develop issues
- case
    - [Higmamap: Sharing information on brown bear appearances on a map for use in research and administrative work.
    - [[Tokyo Metropolitan New Corona Countermeasure Site]]: Improved and derived from OSS (open source) with the cooperation of many engineers and designers.
    - [[Ushahidi]]: also used in [sinsai.info

What is Citizen Science?
- Attempts to involve the general public in the research process and to cooperate in data collection, analysis, ideas, etc.
- Varying levels of effort (from data collection only to citizen-led independent studies)
- case
    - [[Coais]]: An application to search for undiscovered asteroids
    - [[NHK Shizlabo]]: Citizens from all over Japan participate in surveys of raccoons, fireflies, etc.
    - [[Safecast]]: Build your own radiation meter and openly share data from around the world

Example of the fusion of Civic Tech and Citizen Science
- [[Assigned Concierge]]
    - An application that re-suggests the division of household chores with a "fairness algorithm".
    - Opportunity to casually discuss reallocation of household chores among family members/partners
- [[self-made planet]].
    - Estimating CO₂ emissions from lifestyles and proposing decarbonization actions for individuals
    - Utilizes algorithms developed by the National Institute for Environmental Studies
- [[groaning]]
    - Record and visualize subjective sleep data (e.g., time of going to bed and waking up, feeling of being able to sleep, etc.)
    - Looking to use with objective data from smart devices.
    - Users manage and utilize their own data in CSV/PDF with as little personal information as possible

4. future prospects: decentralized society and open science
- Lack of dissemination of the six principles of open science (open access, open data, etc.)
- Dealing with data imbalance and intersectionality
    - Research data biased toward Northern Hemisphere and white males does not reflect the needs of diverse users
    - Need a system to incorporate data on women, children, elderly, disabled parties, etc. as a matter of course.
- [The 3 F's (Fast, Fair, Fun)
    - It is important to be quick and fair to everyone and to incorporate fun

5. summary
- CivicTech and Citizen Science are approaches to turn the cycle of problem discovery, dialogue, prototyping, and verification around with [[citizen participation]].
    - [[open source (software, etc.)]] ・Wider and more diverse participation in society is expected through linkage with new concepts and mechanisms such as [[open data]] and [DAO
- The foundation of a sustainable society is to expand the culture of creating and thinking together, with each individual aware of his or her "rights and responsibilities as a citizen.
