The wise man is immortal. Even if this is not his time, his achievements will be appreciated in many other times.

It is related to the story of [[An idea that will not die out after death]] in Lao Tzu's "[[know one has enough]]".

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
The wise man is immortal.
xx A person of that era.

Rarest person depends on age.

Not everyone finds the age they deserve, and even if they do, they don't always know how to make the most of it. Some people deserve a better century, because goodness of all kinds does not always triumph. Things go in cycles, and even the best are subject to fashions. The wise man has the advantage of immortality. If this is not his century, many others will be.
