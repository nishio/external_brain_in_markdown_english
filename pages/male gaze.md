### male gaze is a concept that refers to the depiction of women as sexual objects from a male perspective in visual culture, such as film, art, and advertising
.

The term was proposed by film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] in 1975 and has the following main characteristics

- The viewpoint of the audience is masculine, and women are passive viewing subjects.
- Female characters are portrayed as being seen by male characters and the audience, emphasizing their sexual appeal.
- Visual techniques are often used to express women as sexual objects.

This concept, which points to gender bias and lack of female agency in visual representation, has become widely used today in media and social contexts other than film.
