title: "Technicians, not source code, are assets"

> [songmu](https://x.com/songmu/status/1798939485931286758) The special team returned the debt and disbanded! Be careful, it's an anti-pattern of something like that.
>  >songmu: the beauty of the style is that the person who dutifully returns [[technical debt]] (or thinks he does) is soon out of it, and it becomes a two-story technical debt


> [tomooda](https://x.com/tomooda/status/1799358505700466712) [[software asset]] is not the source code, but the software engineers who created that source code. Source code is more of a liability. The effect of [[refactoring]] is to [[clear the heads]] of the software engineers rather than the cleanliness of the software. And yet, if you dissolve the company, you're left with only liabilities.
