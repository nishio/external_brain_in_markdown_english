title: "Google Analytics with NextJS"

Just `import Script from 'next/script'`.
- [next-script-for-ga | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/next-script-for-ga)

However, it must be Next.js v11 or later released before 2021/06/16
- [[Next.js 11](https://zenn.dev/aiji42/articles/9a6ab12ab5f6e6) next/script contains the basics of JavaScript].
- Can't resolve 'next/script'.
- I did `npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest` and it worked!
