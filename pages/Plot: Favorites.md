title: "Plot: Favorites"

It is strong when gathered. If you are in a situation where you have two favorites in your hand, you can +2 and draw back with the other one. However, to do so, you need to fill about 40% of your deck with favorites, and it is difficult to buy that many 5-cost cards.
You don't want them to be left out in the wild and collected by others, so you buy a few to sabotage them.
