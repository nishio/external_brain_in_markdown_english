title: "A book that should be chewed and digested well"
---

Some books are enough to be tasted, some are enough to be swallowed whole without chewing, and only a very few need to be chewed and digested well.
    - [[Very few books to chew on.]]

> Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.
    - [[Francis Bacon.]]
    - Some books should be [[tasted]], some should be [[caught on to]], and some [[(somebody's) side]] should be [[digestion]] well.
