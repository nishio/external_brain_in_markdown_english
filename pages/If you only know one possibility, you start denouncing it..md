> [@kuruhowa](https://twitter.com/kuruhowa/status/1632531344168464385?s=20): there was a regular bench and this type at the university hospital plastic surgery and I used this one.
> For those with limited physical freedom, sitting in a chair is a real challenge, and sometimes standing is still better.
> Even for such a person, this one is easy to lean on and very easy to get up.
> Benches that you can't lie down on don't = homelessness-proof.

> [@rasanolem](https://twitter.com/rasanolem/status/1632536590311653378?s=20): @kuruhowa I saw one of this type in the waiting room of a local orthopedic surgeon. Yeah, I thought some people have a hard time sitting low.

> [@kuruhowa](https://twitter.com/kuruhowa/status/1632540696837226496?s=20): @rasanolem When you see something [[unfamiliar]], I think it's healthy to choose a reasonable one from various [[possibilities]] like that. But if you only know [[one correctness]] and make it absolute, you start [[denouncing]] like this.

> [@konahiyo](https://twitter.com/konahiyo/status/1632574640265768960): deleted and scrubbed the tweet.
> I thought it would not be good if only the original tweets were spread and misunderstandings and accusations of [[exclusion art]] and designers were spread.
> Read the tree of quoted tweets.
> Thanks to those who have graciously contributed their opinions about my ignorance. Please also refer to those who had the same simple question as mine.
