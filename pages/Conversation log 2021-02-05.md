- I don't know what the discomfort is.
- I've been digging into the "discomfort" itself.
- I get the sense that the value question was asked before it developed too much.
    - Compared to the logs, it looks like about the 4th most well-developed conversation.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm uncomfortable with the question, "What is the best study for a software developer to do during work hours?" but I don't know what that is, so I'd like to talk about it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "discomfort" is this "discomfort"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "understanding" is that "understanding"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In response to your first question, I'm sure there's something I'm missing or a discrepancy in definitions, and I'd like to know what it is.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "question" is that "question"?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "do it during business hours" is that "do it during business hours"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Whether studying is work or not, and whether you should be paid for the time you spend studying.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "salary" is that "salary"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Implicitly, I think you mean the base salary of a full-time employee. Not overtime or holiday pay.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?

- What does this "discomfort" seem to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It looks like suspicious software behavior. When you investigate the cause, you may find a surprising bug.

I'm getting into the concept of discomfort, so I'll try again: "everything related to software developers," "only things directly related to my current job," "only what I'm told to do."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "discomfort" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It should be more detailed.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to "discomfort?"
