- 1: The population has decreased, so jobs are overflowing.
- 2: More work, but not more people to do that work, so it overflows.
- 3: Increased demand for work has reduced the number of people who can do it, resulting in an overabundance of work.
- 4: In a situation where jobs with better treatment get priority in getting people, the population has decreased, so the jobs with worse treatment are pushed out and overflowing.
- 5: Jobs abound as people are pulled out
    - Real-life pull-outs are a mixture of 4 and 5, as pull-outs are often accompanied by high benefits
    - There's also the "highly skilled people being pulled out" related to #3.
