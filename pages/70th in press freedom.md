---

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gemini/icon' alt='gemini.icon' height="19.5"/>In Reporters Without Borders' 2024 ranking of press freedom, Japan ranked 70th, the lowest among the seven major G7 countries. This is a drop of two places from the 68th position of the previous year.

The ranking is based on the results of a survey of press freedom experts, which comprehensively assesses factors such as political pressure, economic interests, violence, censorship, and media diversity.

Reasons for Japan's low ranking include [[media self-censorship]] due to the [[press club]] system, [[discrimination against foreign journalists]], and the difficulty of reporting on specific topics.

Main remarks
- Political pressure and gender inequality frequently hinder the role of journalists as anti-authority
- Distrust of journalists spread after the second Abe administration took office in 2012.
- The press club system leads to media self-censorship and discrimination against foreign journalists and others.

discussion
The results of this ranking have led to various discussions about press freedom in Japan.
- It is not because of [[government control of speech]], but because of [media oligopoly problem
- It is a state of censorship by activists steeped in a particular ideology.
- Not only the problems of the press club system, but also the negligence of the media should be pointed out
- We should not believe the rankings in the first place.

>  "Press Freedom Ranking: Japan ranks last in G7!
>  "Press pressure from the administration! Distrust of Journalists!"
>
>  In the rankings, however, Japan has long been the world's largest country in the world.
>
>  "The 'press club' allows only certain media organizations access to dignitaries and press conferences and encourages reporters to self-censor, blatantly discriminating against freelance and foreign journalists."
>
>  And that's why the exclusivity of the system has been pointed out. In fact, it is even said that press clubs, in which only major media can join, are a unique system found only in Japan, Gabon, and Zimbabwe.
>
>  In other words, even though the cause of the low ranking is on their own side, the media at hand manipulates the impression as if they are being oppressed, and makes no attempt to overcome or improve the current situation. I would like to say that they should be ashamed of themselves.

>  The Reporters Without Borders ranking, which is often cited by the Japanese media, uses a formula to calculate ratings based on the results of a survey of several dozen or so people in each country selected by the organization. On the other hand, the ranking by Freedom House, an international NGO that is more frequently cited worldwide, is based on a method in which expert analysts evaluate the results according to criteria determined in advance by the NGO itself, and is more impartial. Japan is usually ranked around 40th in this ranking, but the Japanese media does not report on the ranking at all, which is very liberal.
>
>  Incidentally, in the "World Freedom Ranking" (political rights and civil liberties) by the same NGO, Japan is ranked 11th in the world with 96 out of 100 points, the highest in Asia and one of the highest in the G7.
>
>  Well, in Japan, reporters who criticize the administration do not die in unnatural accidents, and on the contrary, the media is allowed to continue to exist without any censure, even if they slander the current prime minister by name or report fabricated stories. Since we are blessed with such a world-class environment, we hope that the media will at least stop the contradiction of "complaining of press freedom while proudly exercising the freedom not to report.

[Ichiro Furudate says Japan has "no freedom of the press" during the Democratic Party of Japan administration "Ministerial-level officials called directly to the program..." (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo!

> [RibbonChieko](https://twitter.com/RibbonChieko/status/1787316432528986470/photo/1) Furudate (former news station MC) testified that he experienced direct calls to politicians such as "Shut him up" during the DPJ administration, but not during the Abe administration. He testified that he had experienced direct calls to politicians such as "Shut him up" under the DPJ administration, but not under the Abe administration, but the press freedom ranking rose to 11th in the world under the DPJ administration, the exact opposite. The press club system is the same, and now they are ranked 70th. The usual biased ranking in favor of the left? Isn't that a dubious organization?
> [RibbonChieko](https://twitter.com/RibbonChieko/status/1787338204435321009/photo/1) The press is shamefully labeled 70th in the world in the press freedom ranking, but in a 2016 article, Furudate Ichiro confesses that he "was under no political pressure from the government - LDP, but he himself staged and made it look as if there was pressure." 2016 press freedom ranking 72nd in the world.

> [gerogeroR](https://twitter.com/gerogeroR/status/1786947504736772296) By the way, why the press freedom ranking is low.
>  "It's the press club's fault," "The press is an oligopoly, so it's impossible for newcomers to enter the market," "TV broadcasting rights are also tied up," etc., and people say, "That's a problem that can be solved if the media would act, right? Don't tell me you don't want to solve this problem because it's a concession? I'm just saying....

> [nippon_ukuraina](https://twitter.com/nippon_ukuraina/status/1786938556377911793) "Japan's press freedom is low," of course it is.
>  Criticism of specific opposition parties and left-wing groups is not allowed, and the media is full of reporters who are convinced that the role of the media is to bash the democratically elected government, not to report the facts. This is not "freedom," but censorship by activists steeped in a particular ideology.

> [SeanKy_](https://twitter.com/SeanKy_/status/1787106538605408594) Freedom of the Press Rankings -- Only this one is bad while similar freedom of speech rankings are good, and the major The main points are deducted from cross-ownership and press clubs, which indicate "media oligopoly problem" rather than "government control of speech", and there is an aspect of criticism of major newspapers and TV stations, but the media tends to be self-serving.
> [SeanKy_](https://twitter.com/SeanKy_/status/1787106614048375165) Gender Gap Index -- Only this one is bad while similar gender gap indexes are good, and the main point deduction The main negative factor is the low number of women in selfless and hard-working positions, which indicates "women's low motivation for work" rather than "discrimination against women" and is a criticism of women's lack of preparedness, but women activists tend to be selfish and self-serving.
> SeanKy_ []](https://twitter.com/SeanKy_/status/1787107335145746461) I think that the press freedom ranking and the gender gap index have a lot in common in that "the people who come up with the numbers need to take a stand and improve them" and "they don't want to go through the detailed analysis of items and lead to a "proposal for improvement" that would take a stand. I think they have something in common in that "the people who come up with the numbers need to take a stand and make improvements" and "they try not to lead to a "proposal for improvement" by going through a detailed analysis of the items".
> [SeanKy_](https://twitter.com/SeanKy_/status/1787110424107946092) Just to be clear, the press club system is a point deduction for the FREEDOM HOUSE as well!

> [_keroko](https://twitter.com/_keroko/status/1787138437625356608) Even if you don't believe the ranking of freedom of the press in the first place, the reality is that "it was the foreign media, the BBC, that brought the sexual abuse of the Japanese". I think it's a reverse of the "flat earth" theory. It seems to be a reverse version of the flat earth theory.

> [FIFI_Egypt](https://twitter.com/FIFI_Egypt/status/1786591017510277231) "Freedom of the press ranking" Japan ranks 70th! The media triumphantly reports that "Japan ranks 70th in the "Freedom of the Press Ranking".... The news is like a variety. However, it is just because they exercise "freedom not to report" by themselves, not because they are not allowed to report properly. We must not make that mistake. The judges probably don't know the inside story.
> [FIFI_Egypt](https://twitter.com/FIFI_Egypt/status/1786659568485052604) Fifi's Personal Opinion on the 70th Freedom of the Press Ranking
>  "It is rare for a country to allow us to criticize the government so freely, and it is amazing that Japan allows us to continue to exist even if we report fabricated news without any blame. Journalism is dead, and Japan is ranked number one in the "Freedom Not to Report" rankings by a landslide!

> [yabusameri](https://twitter.com/yabusameri/status/1764094027849458109/photo/1) One of the things the DPJ administration did better than the Abe administration was the press freedom ranking. That's the ranking even when the minister explicitly threatens to end the company if they write about it. This is proof of how appropriate the ranking is.

> [gerogeroR](https://twitter.com/gerogeroR/status/1787309813774557557) The problem with the press freedom rankings is that unlike other social freedom and internet freedom surveys, the "percentage of industry-related surveys" is fucking high. The problem with the press freedom ranking is that, unlike other social freedom or internet freedom surveys, it contains a high percentage of surveys from industry professionals. The problem with the Press Freedom Ranking is that, unlike other social freedom surveys and net freedom surveys, it is based on a survey of industry professionals, which is very high. Therefore, in the Freedom House Press Freedom Ranking, which has a high ratio of respondents other than reporters, Japan is back to the average of Western countries.
>  So, to be honest, I was surprised to see "journalists being attacked on social networking sites" as a reason for the drop in the press freedom ranking, but it seems that being able to "complain" equally in both directions is an insult that the "aristocratic press" cannot stand. It is an insult that a lowly commoner would rudely express his opinion to the aristocrat of information! And.
>  As long as there is the Internet, the privileges of the aristocracy will disappear, and criticism and praise will be hurled at us in quantities hundreds of times greater than before.
>  This will not change with a change of administration, and "their uncriticized freedom will continue to be violated.
