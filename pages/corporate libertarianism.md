title: "corporate libertarianism"
---

> [[Libertarianism]] can be defined as "a political principle that aims at [[maximizing]] individual freedom. Of course, "[[freedom]]" here refers to the freedom to engage in conduct that does not harm others. In the modern legal system, a corporation is considered a "[(juridical) person" and is entitled to rights as a person. In corporate liberalism, participation in politics is primarily from the perspective of the corporation, and state interference in the interactions of "individuals" in society is kept to a minimum.
