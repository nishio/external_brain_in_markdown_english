- The [[decision-making process]] in [[GitLab]] divides [[decision-making]] into two distinct phases:
    - Data Collection Phase: In this phase, everyone is actively encouraged to contribute data and perspectives that will help the decision-making process. This approach has the advantage of a consensus organization, where everyone can contribute and decision makers can benefit from more available data.
    - Decision-Making Phase: In this phase, informed individuals make decisions without the need for approval from others. This is similar to the advantage of a hierarchical organization, where the people doing the work and their supervisors decide what to do and decisions can be made quickly.
- Each decision at GitLab is assigned a [[Directly Responsible Individual]] (DRI), who leads the work and makes the decision, including data collection; the DRI analyzes the data, considers various options, and evaluates the relevance and bias of different perspectives, the data The DRI actively seeks input from those with meaningful data or experience in the subject area.
- DRIs should have the appropriate level of seniority and knowledge capability needed to gather information and make decisions. This level will vary depending on the complexity and potential impact of the decision. A well-matched DRI will assure team members that the hierarchy is well-informed and knowledgeable. Team members are more likely to feel that their feedback is being considered and are more likely to agree or disagree or commit to a decision.
- A GitLab DRI may make a decision that other team members disagree with; the DRI should consider opinions and make an informed decision, but is not responsible for how people feel about the decision. Once a decision is made, team members are asked to disagree, commit, or move forward.
- Decisions that require input, endorsement, or recognition from others should be accompanied by a concise, well-documented proposal. This proposal should include a statement of the alternatives considered, the recommended approach and justification for it, and the iterative approach. This process promotes transparency, inclusiveness, and data-driven decision-making.
