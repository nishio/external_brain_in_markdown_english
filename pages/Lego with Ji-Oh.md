> [yg45yg](https://twitter.com/yg45yg/status/1687425649961553920) I built #Ji-Oh with Lego!
>  Land battle type with elements of The-O II in various places
>  Total height is 42 cm (approx. 1/60 scale)
>
>  Every part is movable by genuine LEGO motors. Since we used Mindstorms hubs, this time they are 100% made by LEGO, including the batteries!

>  I really wanted to raise my arm while holding the rifle, but it was a quandary.

> [yg45yg](https://twitter.com/yg45yg/status/1687564000824016898) Each part is in the prototype stage
>  I wanted to make a geo with hidden arms that open and close. Both arms are movable, but there are not enough motors, so only the right arm is movable.

We tried to use bevels, but they could not bear the weight of the upper body and jumped off the teeth, so we decided not to use them.

> [yg45yg](https://twitter.com/yg45yg/status/1687596835312218112) I could probably move a handgun or so, but a heavy machine gun would suit me better.
>  Although the chest is smaller than the original geo, the shoulders and legs have been enlarged to give a more relaxed overall appearance.
