title: "No one is equal to the market."

- [[(the) market (as a concept)]] is a group of people, each of whom has different [[values]] and [[money sense]]. No one can accurately predict the movement of the market. It is necessary to make a [[distinction]] between oneself and the market.

Products like this [[There's no way they'll sell.]]" means, "I won't buy them even if they're cheap." And I don't know the difference between myself and the market.

This product [[It will definitely sell.]]" means "I will buy it if it is cheap." And I don't know the difference between myself and the market.

Especially [[creator]] should be careful.
Even if the creator thinks, "This is a good product and should sell well," it does not necessarily mean that the market will think it is a good product.
Even if the creator thinks, "This kind of product will not sell," it may sell surprisingly well.
- By assuming on their own that they will not sell and avoiding [[testing the market]], they lose the opportunity to correct their assumptions.
