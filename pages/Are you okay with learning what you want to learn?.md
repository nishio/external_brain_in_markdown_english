title: "Are you okay with learning what you want to learn?"
---

- [[Tokyo Metropolitan University Special Lecture on Information and Communication 2017]]
- Student> I enjoy learning what I want to learn, but I'm afraid I'll lose myself if I do it all the time.
- Komachi Mamoru> I was fortunate to succeed in doing what I wanted to learn.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Is this the thought that "the future is [[unknowable]] determined by [[fortune]], so there's no point in worrying about it"? #Future is unknowable
- Nishio> I think that if we can improve our "learning what is not in the textbooks" skills, we will be able to change fields in the future.
- Kohei Okubo> You can learn business too. Or get along with people who are good at it. Either of these is a must.
- Shinji Kono> People who choose only what they don't enjoy don't seem to have fun... If you learn deeply, you will naturally broaden... Relationships too.
- Yoshiki Shibukawa> I think that any discipline (mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, etc.) that has [[Ability to describe the world]] can be applied immediately to other fields of study.
