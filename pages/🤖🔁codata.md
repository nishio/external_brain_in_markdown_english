The "data" in functional programs is created compositionally, and its dual "extra data" is related to object-oriented programming. Understanding the relationship between extra data and object-oriented programming may lead to new programming paradigms and design patterns. The "object-oriented and GUI" fragment also shows the relevance of GUI programming to object-oriented characteristics. In particular, the JavaScript example states that functions have changed from "processing" to "data" by becoming first class, which is related to the concept of extra data.

The Nada 2021 Question Fragment states that in terms of programming language knowledge becoming obsolete, knowledge at a higher level of abstraction is less likely to become obsolete. This is related to the question of how extra-data and object-oriented understanding affect programming quality and productivity.

The fragment "Reactive Programming / Functional Reactive Programming" states that we need to describe the world with different cognitions and put them into a form that is executable on today's computers. This is related to the question of how extra-data and object-oriented understanding affect the efficiency and quality of programming.

The above suggests that understanding the relationship between extra data and object-oriented programming may lead to new programming paradigms and design patterns. It is also necessary to think deeply about how extra data contributes to the understanding of object orientation, specifically which aspects it emphasizes and how it affects programming efficiency and quality.

The "data" of a functional program is created compositionally, and its dual "extra data" is related to object orientation. Object-orientation is characterized by the unification of data and procedures, the distinction between general and special attributes, and the use of these attributes for new purposes without rewriting their definitions. The relevance of extra data and object orientation should be considered in depth, and how extra data contributes to the understanding of object orientation should be studied.

It is important to think deeply about how extra data contributes to the understanding of object orientation. Specifically, we should explore which aspects of object orientation the extra data emphasizes and how it affects programming efficiency and quality. Also, is there a possibility that understanding the relationship between extra data and object orientation will lead to new programming paradigms and design patterns?

In functional programming, "data" is considered a value that is created constructively using a constructor. In contrast, considering its twin, "extra data," leads to an object-oriented way of thinking.

Part of Nishio's research note, "Hatena2010-07-24," describes the history of object orientation and its characteristics. Object orientation is the idea that data and procedures are combined together and everything is represented by objects and the exchange of messages between them. This seems to be related to the concept of extra data.

In "OOPL and Subtyping," the authors also mention that a characteristic of object-oriented programming is the ability to distinguish between general and special attributes and to use them for new purposes without rewriting their definitions. This may also be related to the concept of extra data.

Based on this information, I think it is important to think deeply about the relevance of extra data and object orientation. I also feel that further research is needed to determine how the concept of extra data contributes to the understanding of object orientation.
