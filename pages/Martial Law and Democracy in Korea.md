On December 3, 2024, South Korean President Yun Suk-yeol declared emergency [[martial law]] due to a state of national emergency. Martial law is a measure by which the president mobilizes the military to maintain public order in times of war or national crisis, and is based on Article 77 of the Constitution.

However, this decision was met with strong opposition from opposition parties and citizens. Citizens staged protests, including the formation of "human chains," and the National Assembly voted to nullify martial law. Under the Constitution, if the National Assembly, with a majority, demands the lifting of martial law, the President is obligated to comply, and President Yun announced the lifting of martial law approximately six hours after it was declared.

This series of events has attracted attention at home and abroad as a demonstration of the maturity of democracy in South Korea. The swift protests by citizens and the response of the National Assembly are credited with having played a role in deterring the outburst of power.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Many of the posts point out that the understanding of "[[democracy]]" in Japan is shallow, with an emphasis on formal [[majority rule]] and the idea of "[[obeying]] the higher-ups. In response to the citizens' protests in South Korea, the following points have been raised as the current situation in Japan amidst the debate over "what democracy means":
- They misunderstand that democracy = majority rule or [[concerted pressure]].
- There is little awareness [[of monitoring power]].
- There is little awareness [[of citizens' proactive involvement in politics]].
- A structure that does not readily accept [[objections]] or [[diversity]].
- A sense of superiority and discrimination toward neighboring countries remains.
While showing respect for Korean civic action, the report emphasizes the need to reconsider the state of democracy in Japan.

My opinion.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- One of the good features of democracy is that when people think that a powerful force has taken an undesirable action, they can stop it with the power of the people.
    - So we think this case is an example of democracy in effect.
- [[Democracy needs competitiveness to function]].
    - From this point of view, South Korea, where the opposition has succeeded in bringing down the president, is more democratic than Japan, where one party has been [[hegemony]] for many years.
    - Well, the part where the president is criticized by the opposition for being pro-Japanese is a delicate feeling for the Japanese, but if you hide that with [[veil of ignorance]], I think it would be more balanced to have an administration that changes from time to time rather than one that is friendly to a particular country.
