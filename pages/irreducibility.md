Summary: The
Incommensurability is a concept that refers to the inability of different theories, frameworks, and paradigms to directly compare each other using a common standard or scale or to be measured in the same "language.

Commentary:.
A concept raised by philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn.]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], it represents a situation in which the concepts, methods, and problem settings used within one theoretical system are not shared with or easily translated into another theoretical system, so that there is no common index of one-to-one correspondence between the two. This makes it difficult to simply evaluate the different paradigms as "which is right" for each other.
