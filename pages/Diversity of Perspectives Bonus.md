title: "Diversity of Perspectives Bonus"
---

- In the case of a company where being at company X and doing company X's work are loosely coupled, the "possibility of being at company X and not doing company X's work" and the "possibility of not being at company X and doing company X's work" cancel each other out and are negligibly small compared to the "perspective diversity bonus" of doing multiple company jobs.
- Well, but it seems to depend on the company-by-company situation of "how much the company wants the diversity bonus." If the main product is over [[chasm]], does that increase the demand for diversity bonuses because it is useful to adapt to the needs of a diverse majority?

- [[diversity]] bonus for [point of view

- After a while, I reexamined the situation and realized that "there is a possibility of losing concentration thinking about Y" is not limited to cases where Y is a side job, but can also be a family member, caregiver, or romantic partner, and the request to "not lose concentration while at work" is quite impersonal and unbalanced.
