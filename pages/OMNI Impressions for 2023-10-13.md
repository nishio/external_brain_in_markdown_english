OMNI Impressions for 2023-10-13
reading [/blu3mo-public/omni](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/omni)
- > I guess this is the generation of the page with 🌀 in the title.
- Yes, but there's a lot more in there than that.
    - I wanted to make [Pages that sometimes emerge
    - > "What I want to see develop when I wake up tomorrow morning," and "Sometimes it floats up," and "It doesn't have to float up anymore."
    - To restate it in today's terms, there are the following four patterns in terms of time
        - A: Develop now (✍️🤖)
        - B: I'll see it tomorrow, you can do it at night (🔁)
        - C:Update occasionally(🌀)
        - D: You don't have to update it anymore.
    - I first implemented it in B, but as I used it, I differentiated it into four patterns.
        - A will now be developed and turned into D.
        - B and C are repeated
        - Related: [[AI Page Marks]].
- In the early days, it was the implementation of B. The omni itself was the focus of interest, and that was fine, we were gunning for it.
    - As I got more comfortable with it, the omni itself went from being an "object of interest" to a "useful tool.
    - Around that point, there was a division between the use of "A" to "explicitly develop the subject you want to develop," and "C" to "I've been running my guns on B, but I don't think I need to do that anymore.
        - You use A a lot, because you use it explicitly.
            - [[Let it develop.]]
    - I made a mistake in the process of creating [[private-omni]] that unintentionally caused the search results themselves to appear in C, which caused "[Vector search is an opportunity to cut out
        - The system is going to encourage "cutting out" and "componentizing" of it while exploring the surroundings of the subject of interest
        - This is my impression as of 2023/10/13.
- [/nishio/IterativeCommenter's conception](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/IterativeCommenter's conception).
    - > The topic will no longer go off the rails like the original [[Recurrent Notes]], but instead will stay around the summary at the beginning and gradually explore outward.
        - Let's move this to [[private-omni]]...
            - Interesting story about picking up unknown bits and pieces, it's more interesting to search outside of your own Scrapbox...
                - [[Move IterativeCommenter to private]]
        - Behavior expected on the page that emerges from time to time
            - [[image of a fish on a hook]].
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/0aac7a9e64b7457113b4ada283f75353/thumb/1000)

        - I'll put 🌀 on the hook of my writing and leave it hanging in the sea of undisclosed information.
        - 1: Fish hooked
        - 2: Fishing it out and cooking it
