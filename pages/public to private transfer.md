public to private transfer
As for the public/private divide, my old self pointed out that it's a false dichotomy, and I'd like to think about it some more.
    - [[private/public division]]
- Private to public transfers can be done.

    - The private to public transfer doesn't meet my needs.
- Made: [[Finding links between multiple projects]].
    - This one doesn't really fit our needs either.
- What is wrong? How can I fit my needs?

- It seems like a good idea to overwrite the transfer from public to private, not update the public page in the private project, and provide an easy way to create a key page.
