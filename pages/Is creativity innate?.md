title: "Is creativity innate?"
---

I believe that we all have an innate capacity for creativity, it's just that the environment around us nips it in the bud, but I'm often told that I overestimate people...

- [[Creativity Mining]]
    - The idea that most people are [[unoriginal]], not [[original]], and that if you mingle creativity, you will be creative.
