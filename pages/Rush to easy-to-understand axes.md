> [@toyoshim](https://twitter.com/toyoshim/status/1286933672600297473?s=46&t=gkSZtjGEtUZPO0JCzBxCBw): @nimzou There is now a domestic trend to train for coding interviews through competitive There is a trend in Japan to train in programming as a way to prepare for a coding interview. I have the impression that the competition sites and the job placement industry are encouraging it as a business, and the situation is a bit abnormal. I have the impression that it's a bit of an unusual situation.


> When people have a clear value axis, they tend to prefer to focus and delve into that alone.
- from  [[Those who have narrowed their vision around the axis of filling the valley of the axis are looked down upon.]]
- [[Visual field narrowing on axis]]

- [[avoid competition]]

Originally, programming was an individual [[manufacturing]] world with diverse value axes.
- Competition on the Axis] was created by introducing easy-to-understand [[axes of values]] into it [[competition programming]].
- People without the ability to think about what they want to create can now program without developing that ability.
- Tend to vaguely think that they are competing for programming skills
- But when we look at the details, we see that they are competing against each other by measuring only the mechanically measurable components of the many fine-grained abilities that make up programming ability.
    - [[bias to measure only what is easy to measure]].


Why do people rush to [[red ocean]] if they like it?
- Or perhaps a red ocean is created because the majority is going in a certain direction?

    - [[When competing for competitive resources, the majority loses]]
- But [[avoid competition]] is also [[reverse values]].
        - [[Can you spot innovative talent in advance?]]
        - Uniqueness orientation of this
            - [[Novelty for novelty's sake]]
        - [[Find value in it while others think it's worthless.]]


[[easy-to-understand axes]].
[[clarity]].
