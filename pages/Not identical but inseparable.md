title: "Not identical but inseparable"

- [[Rational mysticism]] p.61

I feel like there's nothing wrong with that.
- What makes this seem odd is that it implicitly assumes that if they are inseparable, they are identical.
- When we perceive things as dots without magnitude, we think of inseparable things as if they were identical dots.
    - I drew this rather early on in the [[blind spot card]].
        - [[Different things belonging to the same thing]]
        - [[Isn't it the size?]]
