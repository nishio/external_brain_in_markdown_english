title: "Man is not a machine."

Humans are not [[machine]].
    - Don't expect [[by the rules]] to work exactly [[mechanically]].
- For example, in organizing information, don't do "You must tag according to these rules.
- You will definitely make mistakes, and the negative feelings from making a mistake will [[demotivate]] the action of organizing information itself.
- The [[coefficient of friction]] of the output is increased by trying not to make mistakes
    - [[tiresome]] and output will cease.

- [[People make mistakes.]]
Actions that follow mechanical rules should be done by machines.
