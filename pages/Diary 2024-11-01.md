The claim that the National Democratic Party is a betrayal and the refutation of that claim.
- →Do you rate the KDP's decision to begin policy discussions with the LDP? 79% of the respondents answered "Yes" to the question: [[Diary 2024-11-02]].

I guess this one on 10/30 is a good start.

>  This is a betrayal of the voters who rejected LDP politics.

>  We have made adjustments to mention some of the pledges of the National Democratic Party in the economic stimulus package. These include the lifting of the freeze on the "trigger clause" that reduces a portion of the gasoline tax.

I am sorry to say, but there has been a noticeable shift in the political coverage of the old pundits and the old media. It is a generational change, but those who are young but still have Showa-era views are not keeping up.
> [TetsuNitta](https://x.com/TetsuNitta/status/1851775453654405189) There are channels on YouTube that have clipped videos that are really accurate in reading out the context behind the scenes. I find them more helpful when trying to decipher the thought process of a new type of politician like Mr. Ishimaru. Be careful to update your knowledge or you will become old-fashioned.
> [K_staycalm](https://x.com/K_staycalm/status/1851835257697255562) It is interesting that more and more politicians are able to argue with the media head on, and the media's idea of a schedule is no longer working.


> [kikumaco](https://x.com/kikumaco/status/1852237576708722809) Supporters of constitutional democracy who say these obviously false things? There is no end to it.
>  Many of those who voted for the KDP supported its policies, and that's just "its policies are better than those of the LDP and the Rikken Democrats", not anti-LDP, etc.
>  Please do not lump us in with the Constitutional Democrats, who have no policy.
>  >TomoMachi: The KDP got the anti-LDP vote, so to work with the LDP after the election would be cheating the voters.
> [ayuina](https://x.com/ayuina/status/1852280701250658656) Since the only criteria you have for judging yourself is whether you are pro- or anti-liberty, can't you understand that there are people who support you for reasons that aren't?

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1852260553319965065) Still, I find it very painful to see the established political parties, the media, and pundits all producing various analyses based on the assumption that the KDP will not keep its pre-election promises, and then, when the KDP does what it promised, they get upset and start criticizing the KDP intensely, as if to say, "Read the air! When the KDP does as promised, they get flustered and start criticizing the KDP violently, as if to say, "Read the air! I hope the KDP will keep up the good work.
