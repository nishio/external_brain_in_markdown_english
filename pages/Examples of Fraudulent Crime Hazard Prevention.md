This law is groundbreaking in that it was designed "without the government censoring the content, and imposes identification and liability for compensation on the platform," and quickly institutionalized the consensus of citizen discussion. The future success or failure of this law will depend on the strictness of its operation and measures taken to prevent its spread to other services.
