Taiwan's Fraud Crime Hazard Prevention Act ("Fraud Prevention Act"), promulgated on July 31, 2024, imposes heavy KYC obligations and prompt removal responsibilities on large advertising platforms that are the source of online fraudulent advertising, By imposing heavy KYC obligations and prompt removal liability on large advertising platforms that are the source of online fraudulent advertisements, the Act has nearly eliminated fake ads impersonating celebrities that were rampant on Facebook and YouTube. This law was passed by the Legislative Yuan the following year as one of the "Four Laws on Batting Fraud" after the Executive Yuan adopted a proposal compiled in an online debate facilitated by AI, which divided 450 citizens recruited from 200 k random SMSs into 45 chambers at the end of 2023.

From participatory processes to legislation
- In 2023, 200 k SMS convened on the issue of false advertising → 450 statistically representative applicants selected → 10 x 45 rooms for AI-facilitated discussions.
- The discussions resulted in agreements such as "advertisers' obligation to sign digital signatures" and "platforms' compensation for damages." Based on these agreements, the Executive Yuan approved the "Anti-Fraud Package" by the Cabinet on May 9, 2024.
- The Legislative Yuan passed the bill on July 12 of the same year and promulgated it on July 31.

Applicable to-- "online advertising platforms of a certain size".
- Designated by MODA based on monthly active users, etc. Six companies (Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), LINE, and TikTok) were named to the initial list.
- Overseas businesses are also required to establish a legal representative in Taiwan.

4. core obligations

    - Verification of advertisers' and financiers' status and area of residence, and simultaneous disclosure in advertisements

brief summary
This law is groundbreaking in that it was designed "without the government censoring the content, and imposes identification and liability for compensation on the platform," and quickly institutionalized the consensus of citizen discussion. The future success or failure of this law will depend on the strictness of its operation and measures taken to prevent its spread to other services.
