- A discussion of contributions to the open source community and the return of revenue was held around the case of a developer who had successfully converted from an open source project to a proprietary product and earned an income.
- Mr. Piro, while self-evaluating his non-monetary contributions to the community, raised the question of the lack of return of profits to open source projects.
- Touching on the need for [[expectation management]] in open source, he noted the importance of recognizing [[the risk of having expectations]] for success and reputation.

This series of tweets includes a discussion surrounding an article about a person who experienced the transition from an open source project to a proprietary product. The article focuses on a developer who struggled with open source and then found success and income with a proprietary product. Piro (the tweeter) discusses his contributions to the open source community and the return of revenue, as well as his own actions and ideas.

While Piro feels that monetary returns to open source projects are lacking, he noted that he contributes to the community in non-monetary ways, such as by reporting bugs and publishing his code. He also mentioned the possibility of monetizing open source products for businesses, noting that the lack of licensing fees attracts customers in part because of the low cost.

He also discusses the possibility of making large profits by targeting "only paying customers" through proprietaryization, pointing out that this strategy could apply not only to large companies and independent vendors offering open source-dependent products and services, but also to individual developers. However, he questions whether these profits are being returned to open source projects, and explains why he himself does not accept donations.

Finally, Piro mentioned the importance of expectation management in open source projects, noting that one must be prepared that expectations such as success and honor are "gamble," with no guarantees. This reflects the reality that working with open source does not always lead to direct rewards or recognition.

I was just talking to a student yesterday about the article about the person who said, "We aim to be a place where people can make a living while publishing the results of their work". I wondered if he was funneling the money he makes into those projects. I wondered if he is funneling his profits to those projects.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763409078817341453) I personally don't give money back to open source development projects. I think I am trying to balance the books by giving back to the community as a whole by reporting bugs and releasing my code as open source, but in reality, I think I probably receive more than I give.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763441628650655814) You can make money as open source vs. enterprise (we do), but I think the customer's motive is "it's still cheaper to pay for support because there's no license fee". I think it is possible that the person in question could have made a lot of money because they only dealt with customers who were willing to pay.

The customer satisfaction (i.e., those who paid for the ride) will improve, and JR will be happy.

Anyway, the structure of "my product or service is profitable, but I don't return profits to the open source development projects on which it depends" is not something that happens only between major companies (AWS) and independent vendors (Elasticsearch, MongoDB, etc.). I just wanted to say that. That's what I wanted to say.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763505092177850689) I don't know if that's the person in this article. Maybe he's "I had a hard time eating my way through open source, so now that I'm making money, I'm donating a lot to give back". (I haven't looked into that far)
>  If I had 500 trillion yen in aburaku coin or something, I'd want to donate some of it.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763584868863393914) I don't think I'm the opposite of this story, "accepting donations". I myself might have an unnecessary sense of responsibility, saying "I've been paid ......". I am also afraid that people will come to me with a high-handed attitude and say, "We are paying for it. I'm not sure I can trust people enough to say that no one misunderstands donation in that way. ......

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763585663566561352) I accepted Waterfox's offer because I thought that if I could make the excuse that it was my job and that I had done the work for which I was paid, I wouldn't have to worry about it later on. I honestly think that's part of the reason I accepted the offer.

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763917592069349660) I'm sure there are many thoughts on what exactly the person in this article failed to do, but I think it might be "expecting too much from something that cannot be enforced as a mechanism (such as benefits being returned to you or I think it is "expecting too much from something that cannot be enforced as a mechanism (such as benefits being returned to you, or honor being earned).
- >  >piro_or: I guess when it comes down to it, my criteria for selecting a license is "my own emotional fallout first". I think I only choose non-copyleft licenses for things that I can be "willing to tolerate even if the results are not returned to us".

> [piro_or](https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1763918467533774927) I'm not saying that you shouldn't have expectations, but that it's okay to have them, but you have to be prepared that it's a gamble, that there are no guarantees.
