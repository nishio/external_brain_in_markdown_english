> Optical character recognition is software that converts images of printed or handwritten text into a sequence of character codes. The images used are documents captured by image scanners or photographs, landscape photographs (e.g., text on a sign in a landscape), and subtitles in images (e.g., in a TV broadcast image). Generally abbreviated as OCR.
