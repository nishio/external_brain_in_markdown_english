title: "Young people who don't flirt with authority and those who are emotional."
---

There is a person A.
- A flicks [[authority]] to youth B
- A expects young man B to flirt [[wag one's tail]] with authority
- But youth B [[coy]].

Some A's get angry at this time.
- If A gets angry, it only makes the young man B's side don't get angry, but it doesn't make B flirt with A.
- No purpose is served by anger, but people who don't even know it are just acting emotionally!

A does not understand that "competent young people tend not to flirt with authority" in the first place
- Competent young people have high [self-assurance
- Therefore, when they see others acting authoritatively, they do not consider "their side inferior" because

If A was once a "competent young person" or had the opportunity to observe "competent young people" around him or her, he or she would understand this as self-evident
- So it is clear that A is not such a person

I think B should mute A.
