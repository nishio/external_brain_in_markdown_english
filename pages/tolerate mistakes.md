### Summary of notes
.
The note discusses error-tolerant approaches, approximations, Monte Carlo methods, Miller-Rabin prime determination methods, and random-choice algorithms. These methods seek efficiency and utility at the expense of complete accuracy.

### Relation to Fragment
.
In the fragment "*1202912207*[[Python]] A simple implementation of the Bloom filter" is directly related to the note. The note mentions the Bloom filter, and the fragment describes its concrete implementation; the Bloom filter is an error-tolerant data structure, consistent with the concepts described in the note.

### deep thinking
Throughout the notes and fragments, the importance of an approach that seeks efficiency and practicality by allowing for a certain amount of error, rather than seeking perfect accuracy, is emphasized. This illustrates that in real-world problem solving, it is often useful to pursue approximate solutions because of the difficulty of finding the perfect solution.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
Rather than pursuing complete accuracy, an approach that allows for a certain margin of error and pursues efficiency and practicality is more effective in solving real-world problems."
