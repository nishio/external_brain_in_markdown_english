- Thoughts.
    - At first glance, [[TSP]] but with so many vertices, could a more efficient algorithm be used?
    - Characteristic problem conditions
        - Constant edge cost
        - You can use the same vertex or edge over and over.
        - The sides are held back by 10^5.
        - Is [[minimum area tree]] the minimum cost?
        - Different. For example, when going around 4 vertices, if s is in the center of the Y, cost 5, if s is at the end of the path, cost 3
    - Is it a tree?
        - Maybe so...
- Problem Condition Overlooked
    - Instead of going around N cities, they were going around K cities.
    - Traveling salesman problem to find the distance between each of the K vertices first?
- think again
    - K is as high as 16
        - 16! cannot be searched in its entirety.
        - If it's a product of 2^16 cities already visited and 16 cities last visited, it's fine.
        - â†’[[bitDP]]
    - Vertex is 10^5
            - [[Walsall-Floyd process]] O(V^3) is impossible
        - The sides are held back by 10^5.
        - Thanks to this constraint, we can use [[Dijkstra method]] O((E+V)log V)
                - [[If the sides are 10^5, Dijkstra can use it.]]
    - Find the one to all shortest distance from 16 vertices with Dijkstra
    - Traveling salesman problem based on distances between 16 vertices
        - Note that the pattern does not return to the start
