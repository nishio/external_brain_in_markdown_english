> The hardships of being young" means that "the learning effect is high when you are young, so concentrate on raising your level while it is easy to raise it," not that you should wear out your young time with simple labor that has no learning effect and will soon reach a plateau. It does not mean that we should wear out our young time with simple labor that has no learning effect and reaches a plateau quickly.
> It is more profitable to [[level up]] while you are young and efficient in gaining experience, so it is important to graduate from simple tasks that no longer provide experience as soon as possible. If you mistake [[simple task]] = [[hardships]] as saving [[XP]], you will not improve your level for wasting time.

There may be a misconception that simple tasks are the way to raise the bar.

    - [[Parable of playing time and experience]]
    - > Mistakenly thinking that "I can defeat slimes easily now, I have accumulated experience and become stronger" after defeating [[slimes]] all the time.
