title: "Art medium"

Even with regard to orthodox painting, which many people would recognize as "art," the artist did not make his own canvas cloth, nor did he make his own paints.
Most of the material existence of art is not created by the painter himself. Creation is informational.
Art is the use of a canvas and paint, a [[medium]], and the inventive use of information on it.

Creation can be [Pollock](https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ジャクソン%E3%83%BBポロック)-like.

The creation that takes place informatively does not have to be an external feature. ([[Duchamp Fountain]])
- (Supplement: It may be a change in "view," "perspective," or "interpretation.")

The [[semantic network (AI)]] between images created by AI,[/c3cats](https://scrapbox.io/c3cats) can of course be art. Has anyone done the same thing before me?
    - [[Art as a semantic network]]

PS
relevance
    - [[Art as a probability distribution, not a point]]
