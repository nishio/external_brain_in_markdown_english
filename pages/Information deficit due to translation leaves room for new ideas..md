title: "Information deficit due to translation leaves room for new ideas."

Translation does not convey the full meaning that the original text had, but rather it may encourage new ideas. I read your note in Japanese through my machine translation. I will share the associations. This kind of two-way communication is not possible by publishing and distributing books. It's a new form of collaboration made possible by digital information transmission technology.
