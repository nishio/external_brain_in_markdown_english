title: "Knowledge obsolescence rate is too fast to store."
---

- In [[nomadic hunter-gatherer]], [[Yukito Emaya]] wrote that it was not [[donation]] but [[equal distribution]] and [[joint deposit]], and that [[IT engineers]] do [[knowledge sharing]] because [[knowledge obsolescence]] speed is fast and [[knowledge sharing]] is not [[knowledge obsolescence]]. I thought that [[IT engineers]] do [[knowledge sharing]] because [[knowledge obsolescence]] is fast and "[[cannot be]] stored".
