- [[sense of understanding]] and [[schizophrenia]]

To summarize the conclusion in one sentence: [[schizophrenia]] patients differ qualitatively from normal controls in the way they generate and handle [[subjective certainty]] ([[feeling of knowing]]/[[pleasure of understanding]]). (feeling of knowing) is qualitatively different from that of normal subjects, and the combination of (1) impaired [[metacognition]] function and (2) overconfidence in false beliefs can easily immobilize delusions and false beliefs. This is supported by numerous neuropsychological and brain imaging studies. The medical evidence is summarized below.

1. "Sense of understanding" is a product of meta-cognition
- In cognitive psychology, the feeling of instantaneously evaluating the accuracy of one's memory and judgment is called Feeling of Knowing ([[FOK]]); FOK is responsible for "appropriate confidence adjustment," which in normal subjects is strong for correct answers and weak for wrong answers. ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1155321/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Meta-analyses have shown that this overall metacognition is reduced in schizophrenia and that measures such as FOK and [[Judgment of Learning]] are consistently inaccurate. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10377717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2. excessive "certainty" and delusion formation
- 2-1. [[Overconfidence bias]].
    - Experimental tasks have confirmed that patients exhibit a "reversal pattern," showing excessive confidence in wrong answers and conversely low confidence in correct answers. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5779164/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Taylor & Francis Online [https://www.tandfonline.com/](https://www.tandfonline.com/) doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2015.1135855?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
    - Such overconfidence is associated with a tendency to "jump to conclusions" ([[hasty conclusion]]) and is thought to contribute to increased delusional certainty. ([VUMC News [https://news.vumc.org/2024/11/08/people-with-schizophrenia-show-distinct-brain-activity-when-faced-with-conflicting-](https://news.vumc.org/2024/11/08/people-with-schizophrenia-show-distinct-brain-activity-when-faced-with-conflicting-) information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

- 2-2. association with illusions and hallucinations
    - In visual illusions, patients are less likely to be fooled by the Hollow Mask illusion, in which normal subjects "know" that "this is convexity," indicating that top-down expectations are weak. ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2009/04/schizoillusion?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
        - [[ホロウマスク錯視]]ともいうそうだ: [ホロウマスク錯視 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E9%8C%AF%E8%A6%96)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Similarly, "prediction and sensory weighting" anomalies have been reported in reviews of various illusions and depth reversal illusions. ([Frontiers [https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/integrative-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnint.2014.00063/full?utm_source=chatgpt](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/integrative-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnint.2014.00063/full?utm_source=chatgpt) .com])

3. neural basis
- In fMRI studies, decreased activity in [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[frontal pole]] correlated with FOK/[[insight impairment]] during self-recognition tasks. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4457549/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Academic OUPress [https://academic.oup.com/](https://academic.oup.com/) schizophreniabulletin/article/39/6/1288/1883954?utm_source=chatgpt.com])
- DTI analysis also associated reduced frontal-temporal-parietal white matter connectivity with "not knowing that I am sick ([[no disease awareness]])." ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3085627/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- These circuits overlap with networks that integrate sensory input and prediction and reassess "Do we really know?" and reevaluating the network.

4. implications for Japanese language research
- Domestic qualitative studies have also pointed to the coexistence of "I know what to do" and "I was confused about what to do" in patients' autobiographical memory narratives, indicating a speculative dominance [[Reality Monitoring]]. ([J-STAGE](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jans/43/0/43_43709/_html/-char/ja?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- A University of Tokyo psychiatry intervention study reports that **[[metacognitive training]] (MCT)** can reduce positive symptoms by "unwinding the stiff "[[under the impression that one understands]]". ([University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/ja/articles/z0508_00029.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[clinical-neuropsychology.de https:// clinical-neuropsychology.de/metacognitive_training-psychosis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])

5. clinical implications
1. cognitive-behavioral therapy + MCT: training to reaffirm one's "[[sense of understanding]]" by making one aware of [[false beliefs]] is recommended to prevent relapse of positive symptoms. ([clinical-neuropsychology.de](https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/metacognitive_training-psychosis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. treatment motivation: anosognosia is a major factor in treatment resistance, and interviewing techniques and motivational reinforcement that address FOK are effective. ([Verywell Health](https://www.verywellhealth.com/anosognosia-8636292?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
3. research agenda:
    - Neuromodulation target of FOK (ACC dorsolateral frontal lobe)
    - Self-tracking and overconfidence detection with digital MCT
    - Real-time confidence assessment during hallucination occurrence

6. summary
- The point: In schizophrenia, the subjective conviction that "I get it!" shows a double distortion: (1) [[overconfidence in wrong judgment]] and (2) [[lack of self-validation]], which is necessary.
- Background mechanism: impaired integration of [[frontal cortical-thalamic circuits]] inhibits metacognition and reinforces confirmation bias.
- Intervention: Metacognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce symptoms by developing skills to relativize and revalidate the "sense of knowing".
These findings provide a perspective that redefines schizophrenia as a "neuropsychology of false beliefs" rather than just a "lack of understanding.

    - [[Testing lowers confidence and increases the percentage of correct answers.]]
    - Verification of what we really know gives us the opportunity to correct false beliefs.
    - Confidence goes down in the process.
        - Someone is going to feel emotionally repulsed by the drop in confidence.
        - If your confidence is at 100, it doesn't hurt to temporarily drop to 90.
            - If you do it enough times, you'll see that once it goes down, it will go up to 110 in the future.
                    - [[Crouch before jumping]]
        - If your confidence is 11, you're afraid you're too close to the edge to temporarily drop to 1.
