title: "Wireless presentation from iPad via AppleTV"
---

- Connect AppleTV to power source and connect to projector via HDMI
- Just do "screen mirroring" from the iPad.
    - When I started AppleTV, it asked me to set up Wifi, so I assumed that I had to set up Wifi to use it.
    - Even in places where I didn't yet have Wifi set up on my AppleTV, it connected easily without any setup.
    - Wifi settings do not seem to be transferred from the iPad (because AppleTV itself is not connected to the Internet).
    - Bluetooth?
