> The work of [[KJ method]], which is composed of labels selected by the [[majority rule]] method, ended up like [[honor student]] of [[well-behaved (of kids, animals, etc.)]] with [[trough of the moon (esp. in spring)]] and poor [[enlightening]]. animals, etc.)], which is also [[trough of the moon (esp. in spring)]] and [[enlightening]] poor, like [[honor student]] of [[trough of the moon (esp. in spring)]]. --- [[Exploratory Studies of Knowledge]] p.162
When filtering labels for the KJ method, if everyone decides by majority, only [[safe]] labels that many people agree with will be selected, and the result will be [[every month]]. If you want to create something [[original]], you should not do such a thing.

This reminded me of [[Generalists are selected when evaluated by sum]].
Since majority rule is to add up each person's ratings at 0/1 and take the greatest one, it is equivalent to "rating by sum".
I also wrote in [[How to come up with good ideas]] that they should not be added together.
This kind of [[averaging]] is useful in a school where the majority is advancing, but not in [A situation where the minority wins.
I wrote about this in [[Average orientation is the worst environment]].

Dot Voting is a common method used in workshops with a large number of people.
- [Dot-voting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting)
This is not wrong; the situations in which Dot Voting is used are
- If you have to choose one of several proposals
- Vote on a proposal that is somewhat cohesive.
It is not like the KJ method, which is used for the material you are about to assemble.
