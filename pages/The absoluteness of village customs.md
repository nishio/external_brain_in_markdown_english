Village customs become "normal" for those who never leave [the village

A story about a prominent CEO in one industry who followed someone in another industry with that profile and was blocked because of suspicion.
- > [chokudai](https://x.com/chokudai/status/1824365143465267500) I've been getting a lot of cases where I follow bull aca painters and they are mistaken for vendors and block me, so I added bull aca to my profile. It doesn't look like a vendor ...... or is it a vendor ......? It might be a vendor. ......
    - > [ERU_KII](https://x.com/ERU_KII/status/1824391917850988752) I think we should stop using the blue badge these days because it's like a symbol of impresario zombies and shady accounts...
    - > [chokudai](https://x.com/chokudai/status/1824392136122569074) While I totally understand, I've been wearing the blue badge since 2016, so I'm attached to it. e...... hard ......

I thought, "This is the same as when city travelers go to a [[causal village]] and are alarmed by a strangely dressed man who doesn't look familiar! I thought to myself.
