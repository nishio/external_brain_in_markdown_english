>  1. who mainly remembers the "before interpretation" of the other person's words and actions.
>  2. who primarily remembers only the "interpreted" words and actions of the other person.
>  I get the feeling that there are at least these two races.
>  For example, let's say there was an incident where "my boss yelled at me in a bad mood.

However, it seems that there are people who remember only the "after interpretation" and do not recognize the "before interpretation".

> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1759528817876705779) I wondered why there are cases like "I take everything the other person says or does as a bad thing & can't correct it, so the conversation doesn't go anywhere", but if the "evil guesses" and the "facts" match, well, that's the story. I was wondering why this is the case, but if the "result of evil guesses" and the "facts" are the same, well, that's what I thought.

[[who remembers only after interpretation]].
- [[Corrections don't work]], so [[the conversation]] doesn't work.

- [[Interpretation, not fact]]
- [[Facts and Interpretations]]
