title: "Niche Top Strategy for Cross-fertilization"

- There is a need in the world for someone who has both Knowledge A and Knowledge B.
- Consider the following three
    - Who invested 100 time in knowledge A (100, 0)
    - 100 time invested in knowledge B (0, 100)
    - Who invested 100 time in both (50, 50)
- If the utility is just a sum, they are all the same.
- But in a situation where "we need someone who has both Knowledge A and Knowledge B," it is hard to imagine that someone with zero knowledge of either domain would be selected.
- That is, a utility function that evaluates both in moderation, such as `min(a, b)` or `a * b`.
- Since such a need actually exists, the "cross-fertilization niche top strategy" attempts to fulfill that need by studying multiple fields. A term coined by Nishio.
- It was not clearly verbalized, but in retrospect, we had repeatedly referred to similar concepts since 2011.

- In the above model, knowledge is gained linearly with time invested.
    - If there is diminishing knowledge gain, it is advantageous to learn more than one field of study, even if the utility of mere sums
- While it is possible to think of knowledge gains increasing, a model in which only the top players in the market monopolize utility seems more realistic.

    - Point out that when considering the formation of a multi-person team, combining (100, 0) and (0, 100) results in a large overhead cost for [[coordination of interests]] due to differences in thinking and priorities.

2025-02-19 Relationship to the premise "[[Niche Top Strategy]]"
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o3-mini-high/icon' alt='o3-mini-high.icon' height="19.5"/>A niche-top strategy is one that focuses on a specific, fragmented niche market rather than a broad market and aims for the top share in that field. Companies establish a competitive advantage by developing expertise and providing unique value in areas where large companies are thin on the ground.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In personal survival strategies, it is sufficient to establish a [[competitive edge]] in a [[fragmented niche market]] rather than a broad market to generate enough income for an individual to survive.
    - The way to create this "[[subdivision]]ed [[niche market]]" is "[[multiplying]]".
