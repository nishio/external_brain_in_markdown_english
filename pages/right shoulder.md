right shoulder
- I recently noticed that my right shoulder was rumbling when I did active stretches to rotate my shoulder, and I wondered why.
    - I was walking today and realized I was walking with my phone in my right hand and my shoulder pinned, that's not good.
    - I need to be able to flick type with my left hand.
