Whether it is a recent fad or not is irrelevant to whether it has been around for a long time, so to say "it has been around for a long time" where we are talking about recent times is out of context [[reminiscence]].

relevance
    - [[One symptom of aging]]
    - A variant of [[Sudden self-talk]], [[A sudden old story]]
    - [[Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past]]
    - [[Thinking like something similar in the past]]
