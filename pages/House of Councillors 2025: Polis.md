from  [[Diary 2025-07-17]]
I set up a discussion forum on Polis for "About Foreigners" and "About the Economy".
- Foreigners: [[Polis: House of Councillors: Opinions on foreigners]].
- Economy: [[Polis: House of Councillors: Opinion on the Economy]].
- Media: [[Polis: House of Councillors: The State of the Media]].
