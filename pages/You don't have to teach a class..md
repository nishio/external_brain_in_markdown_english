title: "You don't have to teach a class."
---

    - [Classes are physical education
- No need to teach the class in the first place.
    - I mean, I'm not being asked to teach classes as a professional duty.
    - On the contrary, [[the BMOT Series]] doesn't even need to be done in the first place.
- So why do it?
- From [[I feel it implicitly...]] that doing it is going to provide useful knowledge.
