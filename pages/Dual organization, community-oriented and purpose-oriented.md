title: "Dual organization, community-oriented and purpose-oriented"
---

    - Members who do not contribute to the achievement of goals should be excluded from the [[goal-oriented]] organization.
    - [[community-oriented]] organizations do not exclude members
    - We are expected to get along.
- These two "raison d'être of the organization" are incompatible.
- So, the only way is to create a [[Objective.]]-oriented organization inside a [[community]] oriented organization as a [[Duplex organization]], right?
    - Maintain a broad, community-oriented organization
    - Volunteers from among those gathered there will form a purpose-oriented project team.

    - The [[Alumni Association]] is a group of people who are given the conditions for participation.
    - So there is no option to exclude people who meet the participation requirements.
    - Thus, community orientation is the only option.
    - gated community] because conditions of participation exist
- Project teams should be small for speed of decision making
    - I imagine "up to 7 people" or so.
    - Don't ask for permission or approval from members outside the team every time.
            - [[If it's a good idea, don't ask permission.]]
    - On the other hand, frustration occurs when activities are not shared with members outside the team
        - Things are being decided without our knowledge
        - Create opportunities for involvement in sharing decisions after the fact and returning feedback
        - If you're a person who voluntarily gives input and sweat, you can add them to the team after the fact.
        - It's [[Dual organization and legitimate peripheral participation]].
