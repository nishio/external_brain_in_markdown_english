summary
The "House of Councillors' pluralistic reflection of the will of the people" refers to the mechanism and actual functioning of the House of Councillors to bring "more detailed and diverse voices" into national politics as a complement to the more monolithic and regime-oriented representation that has been strengthened by the reform of the House of Representatives. Recent research (Hidenori Takamiya, "The House of Councillors' Reflection of Pluralistic Public Opinions: Correction and Impediments to Political Reform," published in 2025 ₂) and doctoral dissertations have examined this issue in detail and explained it in the following three dimensions.

1. "[[pluralism]]" produced by institutional mechanisms
_
| Characteristics of the House of Councillors Specific Effects |
| -- |
| Electoral Districts: Prefectural + Medium to large electoral district system (SNTV) Multiple legislators can easily be elected from the same prefecture, and regional factions, industry groups, labor unions, as well as partisan factions, can easily coexist. |
| Proportional representation: Non-binding list Individual name voting is possible. Professional organizations such as medical associations and nursing federations, minor parties, and unaffiliated individuals can easily gain seats. |
| Six-year term, half the seats up for election Less susceptible to the "winds" of the lower house election, and picks up public opinion (economic downturn, reevaluation of issues, etc.) that is out of sync with the time frame. |
| No requirement for a majority of cabinet ministers Weak "control of the House" by the prime minister and ruling party and loose party restraints = easy for rebellion and non-partisan behavior to emerge |

2. functions demonstrated by empirical studies
1. representation of local interests
    - House of Councilors members from the LDP "prefectural assembly quota" tend to take a more cautious stance than the House of Representatives on the impact on the local economy and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, as symbolized by their vote against the privatization of the postal service (2005). ([Takushoku University](https://www.takushoku-u.ac.jp/newsportal/summary/summary_250227_19986.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. voices of industry, labor unions, and other intermediary groups
    - Doctors, nurses, construction industry associations, and others elected on a proportional basis led "professional amendments" in the deliberation of specialized bills, easing the partisan conflict centered on the House of Representatives. ([University of Tokyo Press](https://www.utp.or.jp/book/b10107513.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
3. policy testing ground for small and new parties
    - Environmental parties and small liberal parties, which tend to be buried in the lower house constituencies, gained seats and proposed amendments to articles in the PKO Law (since 1992) and the Law for the Promotion of LGBT Understanding.
- (4) Restraints and balances by a twisted parliament
    - During the reversal period of the ruling and opposition parties after the 2007-2012 and 2019 Upper House elections, 20-30% of bills submitted by the government were amended or scrapped. While this is positioned as a "correction of political reform," if prolonged, it also creates "impediments" in the form of policy delays. ([University of Tokyo Press](https://www.utp.or.jp/book/b10107513.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Takushoku University [https://www.takushoku-u.ac.jp/newsportal/summary/](https://www.takushoku-u.ac.jp/newsportal/summary/) summary_250227_19986.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

Issues and Future Reform Trends
_
| Positive Evaluation Criticism/Issues |
| -- |
| Safety valve against centralization and two-party rule The disparity in the number of Diet members per prefecture (weight of one vote) remains large |
| Improve the quality of deliberations by experts and representatives of organizations Criticisms that local bosses and industry associations are "hotbeds of profit-taking |
| Staggered elections to mitigate "sudden populism" Legislative stagnation and foreign policy uncertainty at a time of twists and turns |
Examples of proposed reforms
- Correcting disparities by reviewing the distribution of electoral and proportional quotas
- Introduce a "unified national open list" for proportional representation, making minorities even more visible by allowing them to win seats even with 2-3% of the vote share.
- Procedural harmonization to resolve twists and turns, such as joint committee review and joint vote of the House and Senate

summary
The House of Councillors complements the "single and quick decision-making" of the House of Representatives by "picking up the will of the people in small pieces" based on the four axes of "region," "function," "small parties," and "time. The existence of the House of Representatives is a double-edged sword that both compensates for and hinders the strong executive branch and the two-party orientation after political reform, while at the same time causing disparities in representation and policy stagnation. The current efforts to correct the disparities and expand the proportional quotas are an attempt to maintain "pluralism" while reducing dysfunction.
