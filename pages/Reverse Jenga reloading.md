title: "Reverse Jenga reloading"
---

I learned about it at [[Unnamed Camp]] [[even if]].
    - Compare [[Constructive Discussion]] to [reverse Jenga (game)
    - In regular [[Jenga (Brazilian brand of haloperidol)]], the person who collapses loses.
    - The objective in reverse Jenga is to stack them without collapsing them.
        - Keep it from falling apart.
        - If someone else places something in a way that seems to collapse, it is beneficial to "re-stack" it in a way that makes it less likely to collapse
