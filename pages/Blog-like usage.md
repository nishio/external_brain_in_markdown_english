title: "Blog-like usage"

- Using Scrapbox as a "blog with content in chronological order.
        - [[Using Scrapbox as a blog makes me hesitant to edit.]]
- Scrapbox was originally created to share information within a laboratory, and the reader and the editorial authority were equal. Abuse is using Scrapbox for [[blog-like]] purposes, in which "one person has editorial authority and readers are unspecified.
        - [[Readers and editorial right holders are equal.]]
    - [[Writing normally makes for long, blog-like sentences.]]

Notation shaking: [[blog-like usage (e.g. of a web page)]].
