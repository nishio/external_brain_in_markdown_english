title: "Organize on top"
---

- [[Scrapbox]] or rather the Wiki concept see [[Wiki mode]]
- Humans usually read new pages from top to bottom
- So it should be as organized as the top.
- Write down miscellaneous notes and thoughts in a sloppy manner, then add organized ones on top.
- The more RAW ones should go on the bottom.
- Given that, when you [[reference]] something and mention it, should the mention be at the top and the citation at the bottom?
- #Intellectual Production
