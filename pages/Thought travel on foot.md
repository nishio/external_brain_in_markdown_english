title: "Thought travel on foot"
---

Before the development of railroads, etc., travel was by foot on your own.
- The image of [[Tokaido Chu Hizakurige]], [[Kumano Kodo]], and [[Saba Kaido]].

Now, unless you dare to enjoy it, use mechanical transportation to get around your destination quickly
- Walk around the destination area

Analogy between "thinking" and "traveling
- Thinking with your head = walking on your feet
- The insistence that "you have to think everything through on your own" is like asking people to walk to their destination when they go on a trip.
- The claim that "if you don't think for yourself, your ability to think will diminish."
    - I think people today have lost the ability to walk, but nothing too serious has happened.
    - Because we just don't "walk to get far" anymore, but we do walk around town and visit places of interest on a daily basis.
- Nevertheless, there are destinations that don't have transportation, and there are views you can't see unless you climb to the top of the mountain on your own feet.
    - The world is always expanding and transportation will be developed later, so the view at the far end can only be seen by those who walk on their own feet
    - Go as far as you can and then walk.
