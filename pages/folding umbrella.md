- Knirps broke in two years, then Bodyguard, and it looks like I've had it for 7 years.
- Out of stock, the link is broken...
- [Bodyguard Folding Umbrella One-touch automatic open/close umbrella Sturdy 10-bone Teflon water-repellent 210T top quality fabric High-strength fiberglass Wind resistant Sun and rain resistant Lightweight Simple 118cm with storage case Japan domestic quality assurance](https://amzn.to/4eH0rbP)
    - Maybe this is it.

    - The one that folds up was also good for one-touch, but the line broke inside and it became "an umbrella that can't stay open and constantly tries to close".

- Not sure if it's a good idea since it's a different manufacturer.

    - The fine figures match 118cm when open and 32cm when folded, so they must be roughly the same.

    - I'm not expecting too much since I got an umbrella with a different name...
        - It is highly likely that the same manufacturer did not change the name, but made a similar one at a lower price.
    - In case you're wondering, it works as a folding umbrella.

I opened the umbrella I was going to throw away to take this picture, and it worked normally, what do you mean?
- The line is not broken, just disconnected?
