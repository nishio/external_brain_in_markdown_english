[[unforeseen blue link]] in [[Scrapbox]] is [[side finding]].
- Unforeseen blue link:.
    - A link you created that you thought would be a red link that leads nowhere unexpectedly becomes a blue link.
        - The phenomenon that [[felt sense]] with a [[semantic handle]] unexpectedly coincided with [[handle]] of felt sense in a different [[temporal context]].
- [[Relationships make aspects]] of the handle match.
        - [[When a "new aspect" is created, there are three ways in which it can be expressed as a symbol]]
- Become a felt sense with multiple temporal contexts
    - I can also see a single felt sense as [[having]] multiple temporal contexts,
    - We can also see the felt sense that was placed in a temporal context [[independent of the flow of time]] and became [[a scheme of things]].
            - [[Test of Time]]
            - [[Replant after a period of time.]]
