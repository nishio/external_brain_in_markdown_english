title: "Phenomenology as an illogical stage"
---

from  [[Study Session 1 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]
- [[phenomenology]] as [[illogical phase]].
The English version was published online.
- [[Phenomenology as non-logical steps]]

When talking to others
- Accept the whole person in that moment.
- I'll try to use their words to describe it.
- Putting other things on the back burner in order to focus on one thing.
    - We don't agree on everything."
    - Any system can be clearly expressed (formalized) in terms of a single point.
- That "point" is not the same in relation to other things.
    - There's another implication in the later part of the story.
    - The "different" is clear. So what is "the same"?
        - What in the world can be "that point" of "commonness" in terms of moving across several clear expressions (formulations)?
- That's not a public commitment.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I mean it is not a common part.
    - A strange order reacting to various explicit expressions (formulations)
        - Converting expressions is a painstaking process
    - No single consistent pattern would be able to encompass the entirety of "the point"
- When something comes to mind, wait quietly until the words come out.
    - If you get interrupted in the middle, you forget even "exactly what you were going to say".

    - [[dialectics]]
    - [[functional pattern]]
    - [[reductionism]]
    - attributed to the fundamental unit
- Eugene Gendlin: "We should be able to cross all three."

phenomenology
- Eugene Gendlin, "The Phenomenologist Had the Other Half of My Method."
    - I knew that "a point" was a clear expression (formulation) of this.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'd like to know the original.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Half of the three crossings, the other half being phenomenology.
    - Criticism that Sartre and the Hegelian school did not find what Merleau-Ponty found in "function" and "refinement".
    - hussar
    - How "conflicted approach" can "lift
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The "lifting" of "cessation" in dialectics.

Three.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have three, you're not "half".
- Dilthey [Wilhelm Dilthey - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey)
        - [[Understanding is Creation]]
    - For Dilthey, the experience process is understanding
    - Understanding that we are created within
    - They are examples of what it is about, because individual advances can create more of the other
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You're talking about the IOFI principle.

Should I also explain Hegel's story lightly?
phenomenology
[Phenomenology - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/現象学)
- Hegel (1770 - 1831) published his work "[[mental phenomenology]]" [[dialectical phenomenology]] in 1807.
- Husserl (1859 - 1938) proposed [[transcendental phenomenology]].
- Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976) [[hermeneutic phenomenology]].


Phenomenology is some kind of progress in the thinking stage
- Experience Process and Meaning Creation Raises Seven New Advances
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to explain what this is.

Carl Rogers
- How new consciousness can be collated against organismic experience to validate emerging oppressions
    - He "searched for the corresponding truth."
- Eugene Gendlin.
    - another way
        - Instead of looking for certain experiences prior to symbolization
        - Several steps
            - It became the "Experience Process Scale."

Carl Rogers
- On becoming a Person

Steps Teaching Method
- Now called Focusing.
- Psychotherapy is failing to teach how to do it.
- Prefer to give expertise

- [[Csikszentmihalyi]]
- For me, [[Chicxent Mihai (China)]] is more appropriate.
- Questions about things
    - Die Frage nach dem Ding.: Heidegger,
    - [The Question Concerning the Thing: On Kant's Doctrine of the Transcendental Principles (New Heidegger Research)](https://amzn.to/3Em9lu4)
        - You write that Heidegger thanked you with a nice afterword.
    - "What Is a Thing?"
        - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/What-Thing-Martin-Heidegger/dp/B000NC13NI/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eugene+gendlin+Heidegger&qid=1638523811&s=books&sr=1-3)
        - > by Martin Heidegger  (Author), W. B. Barton Jr. (Translator), Vera Deutsch (Translator), Eugene T. Gendlin (Contributor)
        - Not this way?
    - The former, from the table of contents, looks like Eugene Gendlin won't be showing up.

- Many philosophers are
- Avoiding physics for fear of bringing reductionism into philosophy
- Avoid bringing in psychology and avoid human experiential processes.
- Heidegger believed that everything had to be brought in.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I agree, and I think philosophers who want to create something of historical value in our time should study programming (polemic).
    - Statehood, not emotion
    - "Dwelling," "statehood," misunderstood.
    - Difficult to understand that "investiture" has meaning in "mood."
    - Difficult to see that "home - thinking" is found and implemented
    - Heidegger left phenomenology and attributed events to "history"
        - As a result, the "phenomenon" has become inseparable from language and history.
        - Many people misinterpreted that as "every experience is an old idea."
        - Heidegger believed that history occurs in "dwelling
        - Thinking-Dwelling."
- Phenomena are not isolated; all experience is dependent
- Failure to assume that there is a neutral, uninterpreted "phenomenon"
    - It went on to assume that every experience derives entirely from an implicit assumption that can only be broken by discontinuity
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm not sure, do you have the original text?
- Overlooking illogical transitions.
- When we understand exactly the complexity of the formation, when it transcends its form
    - When you don't understand it, all you can do is quote it.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>That's me right now.
    - To understand is to "dwell - think" "within" the form
        - This is a more accurate understanding than "keeping" the formality
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> [[Shuhari]] I associate it with
            - When you don't understand, all you can do is follow the pattern.
            - When understood accurately, the mold is broken.
- "Further -movement -seeking -order."
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>No, I wanted this to be written in the original language.
    - ~ is intricate and complex rather than a consistent principle
    - Has more order (order) than formed form
        - Coercively accurate feedback
- process of experience
    - Richer and wiser than fixed forms
    - It's called disorder.
    - It means both "no logical order"
        - The [[Dionysian]] Experience of [Nietzsche
        - More complex and sensible than the order formed
        - Disorganized, but working in an orderly fashion.
    - There is a higher order and a lower order.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Scrapbox's apparent disorder may be a higher order.
            - The lower order here is, for example, "that the page is in a folder that represents its classification."
            - Scrapbox is richer and smarter than fixed hierarchical classifications."
            - I have a feeling you're right.
    - Finding "internal" differences "toward a voluntary process.
    - [[derrida]] "movement"
    - It's not arbitrary.
    - Individual movements end up as motionless contradictions.
    - He believes that the overthrow of order is disorder.
- When Dionysian experience works with pre-existing kinds of experience, it creates more order than ever before.
    - Not a mere lack of pre-existing order.
    - Nor is it the product of an order implicitly imposed and formed.
- Nietzsche's Body-Knowledge, Scheleiermacher, Dilthey, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger
    - This order can think and study itself, an intermittent reaffirmation of
    - Such thinking is not just fuzzy [felt sense
    - The work of understanding "precisely" transcends disconnection and form (distinctions and overall patterns).
