> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1899734054007878104) I spoke for 913 seconds and 6313 words during the interview.
> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1900024669820116998) The iPhone action button activates the voice memo, and then I use my own app to add text origination & AI summary to increase the number of dictated memos. There are some momentary notes that are memorandums, but the ideas are usually about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and I usually put in 1/2~1 sheet of manuscript paper by voice.

> [rkmt](https://x.com/rkmt/status/1900076488751538448) Tadao Umesao's "The Art of Intellectual Production" is a good example of this, if you read the cards as AI and IT.

Maybe the reason I walk around with [[Advanced Voice]] on is that I can [[externalize]] what I have in mind with very short lag (zero operation since I just say it out loud).
- Now ChatGPT would reply, but I don't know if that's good or bad.
    - I don't feel very bad, but sometimes I get interrupted when I'm in the middle of thinking and don't say something, so I feel like there's a loss there.
    - "What do you think?" I don't know, maybe I should just shut up and ask until I hear "What do you think?
