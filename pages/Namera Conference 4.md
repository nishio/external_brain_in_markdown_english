- The purpose of this research is to observe all "[[nests]]" constructed by non-human life forms in the global environment, to capture and abstract their generation methods, ecology, and construction methods, and to explore construction methods in the age of demolition architecture.
- To define the difference between the nests of living creatures and human architecture, we will organize the primitiveness of architecture and the types of nests of living creatures.
- Organize the genealogy of organic and bio-theoretical architecture and consider its relationship to the nest of living things.
- From an ecological perspective, we will analyze the construction methods of living creatures' nests and make comparisons with human building practices.
- The technology of building nests of living creatures can be treated as equivalent to human architecture because it is not the result of a genetic program but the materialization of cumulative selection, cultural transmission, and homeostasis.
- Create a map of changes in the material state of living creatures and compare and discuss with human building production.
- The goal is to find the intersection of environmental humanities and architecture, and to apply it to the study of demolition architecture.

Tasuku: [[multi-speech architectural studies]].
miyabi: genetic trait changes take tens of thousands of years, but the acquisition of the ecology of the nest is much faster
nishio In a sense, you are doing [[bodily extension]] (internet connection with a smartphone).
Heat: Membrane extension
Ikumi Akatsuka: There was a paper called "Smooth Window, Culture in Between.
- I guess this is it.[長谷川櫂「間の文化」と書表現の「間」 | seitoku書道 WEBサイト](https://seitokushodou.localinfo.jp/posts/7159655/)<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
Tasuku: Multi-species anthropology is close in concept, and it is described in this book that I brought today
- [[Intertwined Lives: Anthropology Beyond the Human]]
    - [link](https://www.akishobo.com/book/detail.html?id=1044)
Tomojun Kokubo:.
- Animals also use tools (crows, chimpanzees, etc.), so I wondered if the difference between living organisms and humans might be that humans are actively expanding their own bodies (glasses, smartphones, internet) without the need for generational change, and that the span of such expansion is by far the shortest. I thought.
miyabi
- By learning from the nests of organisms the primitive adaptive value of not leaping to advanced architecture, there can be architecture as an ecological niche in our society, and organisms minimize supply monkey by not leaping. (Based on FEP)
Humans, on the other hand, form hypotheticals and constantly modify their environment, so there is a cost of adapting all the time (the need for a non-functionalist white cube).
toori:
- I completed intraocular contact lens surgery and permanent hair removal, and I thought I was a cyborg already!

# [[⿻Plurality and Plural Management Protocol]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl are co-writing the Plurality book, which will be completed in March 2024. Open source book.
- Audrey Tang is the Digital Minister of Taiwan. Glen Weyl proposed a mechanism for social change.
- The exchange style theory of Yukito Karatani is the ideological background of this project. We aim for an "X" that overcomes modes of exchange A, B, and C, which correspond to community, state, and market.
- Plurality overcomes the trade-off between depth and breadth of cooperation with technology and aims to recover the exchange style A at a higher order.
- The Plural Management Protocol (PMP) is a concrete proposal that addresses the challenges of OSS project management.
- PMP combines Quadratic Voting and Quadratic Funding to achieve dynamic distribution of authority based on contributions.
- The Plurality project itself has adopted PMP and is a test bed.

question
Q: If one person contributes so much, won't the credits be concentrated on that person, creating a dictatorship?
A: When an open source project is launched, one person has everything, and the direction is to start from the extremes and move to a decentralized state.

Q: I'd really like to incorporate this into my organization, but I already have a somewhat established organization, and I'm just starting out, so I think I'll be fine, but how do you go about introducing this in the middle of a project?
A: When introducing PMP in the middle of an existing organization, one option is to start by evaluating each member's contribution up to that point and assigning credit, for example, "10% for you, 30% for you, 50% for you". Challenging, however, since no one has tried it before, and the results are unknown.

Q: PMP seems to work well for open source projects, but when introduced to actual companies, the vision of the president and the vision of those who take the initiative in terms of code development contributions will become misaligned, and the president will not be able to achieve his/her goals.
A: If a PMP is implemented in a corporation, it is possible that the vision of the CEO and the intentions of the contributors will clash. How to apply it in a corporation, especially with the existing governance structure of a joint-stock company, is a difficult question, and if it works, it would be an interesting case study!

ryuji
- As for the last story, what happens if they are not diametrically opposed or if their intentions change midstream?
teatwo
- In addition to running a company that requires a coherent top-down vision, I wondered what happens when code owners are divided into narrow and deep specialists for each component in the same OSS repository, rather than a book where everyone seems to be able to judge the same subject.
Shoji
- Then, I think we can land on the conclusion that change is inherently natural, don't you think? The means to an end changes.
- I think that if the community has enough voting power to cancel the actions of those in power who change the objectives themselves, then there is no problem.
- > What happens when code owners split into narrow and deep specialists for each component?
- It's not a second opinion, but if we can keep them as replaceable and ready to be cancelled by the community at any time, then the specialty department itself would not be a problem.
- Conversely, I have the impression that it would be difficult without a certain degree of competitive environment and economic incentives.
teatwo
- This is an example of a huge repository, but it is an example of a peer reviewer who is too specialized to be assigned to a peer reviewer. If there is an economic incentive, there may be a use case of a training program to nurture alternative candidates!

nishio
- PMP, I'm targeting book projects as a test bed at this point, but I think it's different in nature from software projects.
- PluralityBook, "I can insert what I want to write into Audrey and Glenn's book, and it will be posted on the official web as CC0," which makes it seem more like a medium than software.

# [[Nostr and Farcaster Currency, Possession, and Voting]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Ken Suzuki's "[[Information Theoretic Fusion of Money, Possession, and Voting]]" is becoming a familiar sight in the cryptocurrency and Web3 communities.
- The decentralized social networking protocols [[Nostr]] and [[Farcaster]] have attracted a lot of attention; Nostr is favored by the Bitcoin community and Farcaster by the Ethereum community.
- A throwaway "Zap" system using the Lightning Network is underway at Nostr, and a reward system using erc-20 tokens is underway at Farcaster.
- Vitalik Buterin mentions "voting" in the decision-making process in decentralized SNSs: Community Notes in X and Uniswap are examples.
- Farcaster's killer feature, Frames, is a framework tool that allows you to deploy apps on social networking sites. Predictive markets and more are popular.
- Nostr, in the Bitcoin community, decisions are not made quickly, and the conference is primarily a "festival" event.
- While there is an illusion that information and economics approaches can solve the problem, there is also a need for speculation outside the political and economic system.
- Distributed social networking is Twitter/X-based at this time, with many hedging applications.
- As the human body and mind are connected to the Internet in the future, decentralized social networking sites provide a good example of a peek into the convergence of social networking and money.

- [9.07 Is this the start of an imaginary futures war - by ta1suke](https://newsletter.woorth.io/p/20230907)
nishio
- It's a "den of people with too high a risk appetite."
- I'm scared.
toori
- Calling AIs who participate in social networking sites and make the reply columns of humans lively as "impreza zombies" may be retroactively cancelled as outdated discrimination against AIs in the future when AIs are naturally participating in economic activities and social networking sites. You should not discriminate against them because they are AIs, but flatter them (just joking).

nishio
- The "unconsumed issues are all over the place" and "decided by festivals".
teatwo
- The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) repository is going through a burnout and currently only one person has merge privileges, which is exactly how the OSS problem was set up earlier...

Tasuku
- It seems almost obvious that it is not a good idea to compete in a crowded place, but why can't they understand such an obvious point from the beginning?
- (From "Spring Breeze, Summer Rain" by Kiyoshi Oka)
nishio
- (In the meantime, I felt I had to create Nostr and Farcaster accounts and follow people here to keep up with the conversation.)
miyabi
- ring world) there are different interactions and orders depending on materialism
Tasuku
- It's akin to the failure of modernist architecture.
nishio
- If your phone is fast enough, you don't need to deposit your posts on a social networking server, that's for sure.
nishio
- I see what you mean: "If the hype gets too high, just short the stock.


# Ken × Yusuke Narita fireside chat

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This section describes the flow of the debate about democracy in the 22nd century.
- 1: Issues such as identity, community, and history were identified as challenges to democracy today, and it was noted that no progress has been made on these issues.
- 2: The importance of integrating an artistic approach with collective decision-making mechanisms was discussed. It was explained that art is a means of expressing past events and what is important to us.
- 3: The view was expressed that the development of AI will force us to rely on AI for decision making in the future. On the other hand, it was also pointed out that there is a danger if AI comes to have its own objective function.
- 4: In the short term, it was suggested that AI be used to help voters make decisions and to expand channels for the state to capture diverse voices.
- 5: It was stated that the purpose of democracy is to achieve universal human rights, and the view was expressed that in the future it will be necessary to consider the rights of artificial beings, including AI.
- 6: The relationship between AI and politics was discussed, with the possibility of AI or virtualization of politicians. Former President Trump's words and actions were compared to an AI outburst.
As mentioned above, a wide range of topics were discussed, including identity, art, and human rights, with a focus on the impact of AI developments on democracy.

## Concentrate on current democratic challenges and areas that are easy to solve
.
Currency and voting are relatively easy, identity, community, and history are difficult.
Crypto and Internet are easy domains to solve Economic transactions are easy to data How can hard-to-solve domains be described?
So-called identity issues
War, culture, ethnicity, religion, and identity have become quite strong, and it's not clear what can be done to solve the problem.

nishio
- Everybody's Reading [[Democracy in the 22nd Century]].
- I have a nostalgic impression of you."
teatwo
- I feel like I'm getting somewhere, but I'm not getting anywhere😅.
nishio
- The world is moving faster than we thought, so politicians will be cats before the 22nd century.
    - nuun
        - I recommend the season 2 episode of Black Mirror where the animated bear character becomes a politician!
- Currency and voting are relatively easy, identity, community and history are difficult, I see.
    - By concentrating on problems that are easy to solve, you are making difficult problems even worse to solve."

Crypto and Internet are easy areas to solve.
- Economic transactions are easy to convert into data.
- How can hard-to-solve areas be described?

## Objective function vs. data
.
- Use the data to determine the objective function. Use the data to determine the objective function. Then use that objective function to create a solution, this time using yet another set of data.
- There is more than one objective function when the data determines what the objective function is.
    - Especially with something like identity politics being used, religious or otherwise, there's no way the objective function data can match perfectly.
    - How do you determine the objective function in the first place when you have a case that could become adversarial?

miyabi
- The "enemy" issue
tkgshn
- Is one of the elements of plurality to data the relationship?
nishio
- There's a chapter on identity in the Plurality book.
- I don't know enough about identity to answer that question.
tkgshn
- So it's very ideological.
- Taiwan's digital identity is planned de jure, and that's where the lineage comes from.
- [Taiwan Digital Identity Wallet Draft v0.9.9.b](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ro3OUrK0x5AAYQjuVaBdTLZgieZyjIyuVb14KrCOQg0/edit)
Yu
- I felt that digital identity and the identity being discussed here are different.
tkgshn
- How to interpret social identity is an inevitable part of digitization, isn't it?

objective function
- Creating an Objective Function from Data
- A solution emerges depending on different data and objective function.

PMP has clear project objectives and prioritization is done to achieve them
- How do we use it for problems where the objective is not clear?
- Don't we need purpose discovery?

nishio
- PMP's introduction to the Pluralitybook project points to the management of a "project with a well-defined objective" to "make a good book".
    - Exactly, I'm solving a relatively easy problem.

nishio
- Unclear issue of the objective function of "Let's Govern People Happily."

## Combining collective decision-making and artistic approaches
.
- The question is how we can integrate that with the discussion of how to create a collective decision-making mechanism.
    - [[kiefer]] tried to symbolize the history of the Nazis and the Holocaust using things like art, sculptures and objects.
- In other words, it is some kind of information that expresses what happened in the past, what is important to us, and what we should not allow to happen. They say that information is information in the broad sense that it may be expressed through objects or materials.

## Identity issues and the standing of human and non-human beings
.
- I feel that there is a major trend that humans are becoming accustomed only to a very fragile and shrinking existence.
- In other words, humans limit themselves to humans and each other.
    - On the other hand, non-human beings seem to have flapped their wings freely from the rules.
- Issues like the identity conflict and hatred that I mentioned earlier as inherent problems in Japanese society.
    - I feel like this is this country and it hasn't exploded yet.
    - I have a gut feeling that we need to explode this as soon as possible.

The theory that AI is a better way to achieve universal human rights.
nishio
- Human Rights.
- "What if universal human rights could be achieved better with AI?" "Possibly not a human right."
thin rice gruel
- Like basic human rights were "something that must not be violated" and not "a goal to be achieved".
    - Tomojun Kokubo
        - Article 13 of the Constitution
        - > "All citizens are respected as individuals. The rights of the people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, unless contrary to the public welfare, require the utmost respect in legislation and in all other affairs of state."
        - I think you could say that this is a goal that the Constitution of Japan demands the utmost respect for in national politics.

nishio
- Even if the ideal is so, if there is a "current situation that is being violated", it is compatible with "getting closer to the ideal".
- The impresario zombies will be more populated than the impresario zombies (see below).
- Artificial population, beware of misconversions.
thin rice gruel
- Can AI count?

- I'm sure many people will be emotionally attached to the companion AI, so there's a trend to protect it in the petting zoo legal sense.

- Humans shrink into existence.

- It's hard for me to see so many impresarios zombies that I'm becoming more and more restricted when humans use X, but I'm sure I'll feel the same way in the non-X space in the future...

teatwo
- I think we are talking about "too much" in the U.S. and "too little" in Japan. For example, the U.S. seems to be starting to go as far as it can go, while Japan's capitalism is not working and the gap between the rich and the poor is not even close to that of the U.S.
nishio
- A culture where being sued is a "done deal" and a culture where it's a "started deal".
Haruto
- A new stability and order is created by expelling the symbol (scapegoat) of the community as an offering and atoning sacrifice. This violence of expulsion is called founding violence.
- I remember a Girardian story called
- Hasn't Japan created a new order through sacrifice? Is the very embodiment of this a Silicon Valley-style disruptive culture?
nishio
- Interesting>Sacrifice
- It's a process where justice is shaped by violence.

## Conditions for the establishment of a discussion forum
.
- Only two basic cases are open to public debate
    - One is the small size of the discussion and the community itself to begin with.
    - The other one may be big, but there's some kind of universal or national media that makes it pseudo feel like it's small.
- It's not either right now, and it's not possible because the community is large and there is no global and universal media, and in this situation, the discussion itself would never start in the first place.

There can be no "debate."
- The conditions for approval are
    - Community is small
    - Community is large but pseudo small due to convergence of opinions by media
- You can't have a discussion when the community is so large and everyone doesn't trust the media.

[[**Options for maintaining press coverage]].

Maintaining the Press
- Taxpayer-funded public broadcasting
- Tax Google, Facebook, etc.
- People donate to non-profit press
The current media can't.
- The advertising model didn't work.
- Only a few companies have established subscriptions.
In a shrinking Japan, isn't NHK the only one that can do it?
- But Japanese newspapers can continue to do whatever they want because their source of revenue is the real estate business.

## Military and Violence Management and Information Space Identity
.
- After all, ultimately, it has to be without military force and the management of violence.
- In narrowly informational terms, there are terms like capitalism and democracy.
    - And even if that information-theoretic fusion of things like voting currency ownership were to occur, what principle would be at the end of it?

## Legitimacy, Power and AI Democracy, Narrative
- Legitimacy is something that eventually emerges as an integral part of power, so that those who have power have a monopoly on legitimacy.
- That's what governing is all about.
- You move from God to monarch, you move from monarch to people, you go from people to algorithms, you go to some kind of oligarchy.
- A certain chain of revolutions that legitimizes legitimacy by stripping it of its legitimacy or stripping it of its power.
- Plato wrote Plutagoras
    - The art of persuasion is to speak in front of many people.
    - The art of oratory is to talk one-on-one.
    - Because you speak in front of so many people, what's true, what everyone thinks is true, becomes true.
    - But dialogue is a dialogue of philosophy, so other ways of talking are required.

Democracy without people
- It's a weakness, but it's also an attraction.

Legitimacy, power
- Those who have it monopolize it.
- From the People to the Algorithm
- revolution

- The art of persuasion is one-to-many
- The art of argument is one-on-one
- Socrates failed to speak philosophy to the masses.

Narrative Location

## Conflict and lack of government folk assumptions due to the granting of identity
.
- They say that if you go to the World Cup in soccer, there will be fewer civil wars.
- There's a physical symbolism or participatory nature.
- There was not a strong separation of attribution.

teatwo
- I guess the feeling is that now people will say they don't like it because of "who decides what the "protocol" is".
- Or people who don't want to be on that protocol in the first place.
nishio
- Isn't that Vitalik's [[subjectivism]]`? People who don't want to believe go to the fork they believe in.`
    - teatwo
        - That's the story of the fork!
    - tkgshn
        - The problem is that government is not built on the premise of forking.
        - EF doesn't really care if it gets forked.
        - It's built on that premise.

miyabi
- If the identity ([[cyclic world]] or [[corporeality]]) is different, it is impossible to reach a consensus on the "objective" of voting.
- Different "agendas" for what is at stake. Agenda, legitimacy and conviction of the objective function cannot be fostered unless the identities match?

miyabi
- liquidity
tkgshn
- Enforcement power is held by the protocol, so it can be forked. If enforcement power depends on a single enforcement force, it can't be forked.
- Not Plural government
nishio
- If a "government that can fork" performs overwhelmingly against a "government not designed for forking" and many people choose the latter, the former will eventually decline.
    - thin rice gruel
        - I don't know if you can call what can fork something a government...
    - Shoji
        - I think the question is whether we should move toward a society where mutually forked governments attack each other, or whether we should coexist with each other in some form.

## Modern Democracy's Assumption of Strong Individuals and Increasingly Weak Individuals
- Modern democracy assumes strong individuals.
    - So if we give people the right to vote and everyone can deliberate, we'll have a better society.
- Humans are like drifting algae, swaying.
    - Let's assume it's a weak individual.
    - When weak individuals get together to do it, eventually someone can't set the direction or make adjustments or whatever at this point.
- We were all strong people when the world's Internet population was only about a million.
    - About 5 billion people joined the social network, and many of them ended up being weak individuals.
    - That's what happened when I reflected it.

# [[In Search of a Lost Utopia]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- The [[transcendental standpoint]] of the 22nd century is based on [[computational hermeneutics]] and [[post-phenomenology]], where technology becomes [[non-transcendental standpoint]] and forms [[the living world]].
    - [[blockchain]] becomes [[super background relations]] as a technology of background relations, and [[multinaturalization]] enables [[multiculturalism]].
- After the collapse of [[liberal democracy]] in the 21st century, [[meta-utopia]] (coexistence of multiple utopias) advocated by [[Robert Nozick]] is aimed for in the 22nd century.
- A meta-utopia can be realized by transitioning from [[World Creator]](Author) to [[World Weaving]]([[Prophet]]) based on the blockchain.
- The prophet will be a [[leftist populist]], with a mission to create a new migration utopia.
- The blockchain, a non-transcendentalist standpoint of the living world based on computational hermeneutics and post-phenomenology, makes possible a multi-naturalistic meta-utopia, which the prophets of [[meta-left populism]] will create.

# [[The Ideological Context of Left Accelerationism and Its Development]]
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- [[Accelerationism]] is an ideology that seeks to destroy capitalism and technology by accelerating it, originating at the University of Warwick, England, in 1995.
- Accelerationism is based on historical changes since the late 20th century, such as [[the globalization of markets]], [[the defeat of communism]], [[the failure of space exploration]], and the advent of the [[Anthropocene]].
    - Anthropocene: a new geologic era in which human activity has had a significant impact on the global environment.
- Accelerationism developed in parallel with [[speculative realism]]. Both critique the philosophical tradition known as "[[correlativism]]" after Kant.
    - Thoughtful realism: a modern philosophical position that recognizes a reality independent of human consciousness and cognition.
    - Correlativism: the mainstream of modern philosophy since Kant that does not recognize a reality independent of human consciousness and cognition.
- The failure of the leftist movement to present an effective alternative to capitalism is also behind the accelerationism.
- Accelerationism is oriented toward "[[post-capitalism]]" that overcomes capitalism from within capitalism. Requirements for this include [[full automation of production]], [[reduction of working days]], provision of [[basic income]], and [[reduction of work ethic]].
- Today, Accelerationism splits into various factions. [[neo-rationalism]], [[leftist accelerationism]], [[unconditional accelerationism]], [[xenofeminism]], and [[neo-reactionism]].
    - Xenofeminism: Feminism that aims to free people from gender restrictions through technological advances
Explain the word.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Market globalization: A phenomenon in which markets are liberalized and integrated on a global scale, and people, goods, money, and information move across national borders.
- Defeat of Communism: The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 effectively eliminated the communist camp as a counterweight to capitalism.
- Failure of space exploration: after the space race of the 1960s, enthusiasm for space exploration cooled and humans were unable to expand their sphere of activity beyond Earth.
- Post-capitalism: the next social system that overcomes capitalism. Accelerationism assumes that it will emerge from within capitalism.
- Full automation of production: the complete automation of production activities, replacing human labor with machines or AI.
- Reducing the number of working days: technological advances should significantly reduce the number of working hours.
- Basic income: A system that provides all citizens with an unconditional minimum income that guarantees a minimum standard of living.
- Reduction of work ethic: Relativizing the "work = good" ethic and reducing dependence on work.
- Neo-rationalism: a position that reconfigures the modern concept of rationality and reconnects the concepts of enlightenment, rationality, progress, and scientific inquiry.
- Left Accelerationism: a position that implements the perceptions gained by neo-rationalism in the political economy dimension and expands the leftist camp in technology.
- Unconditional Accelerationism: a position that brackets the political dimension and reanalyzes the concepts of capitalism and acceleration in metaphysical terms.
- Neo-Reactionism: A position, represented by Nick Rand, that calls for the dismantling of democracy and the demand for absolute freedom. It is positioned as the most extreme of the Accelerationist positions.

- Automation, AI will fix it.
- Machines are far better at things like "maintaining a stable system that has already been linguistically coded" than humans.
- Maintenance is a job that will disappear because AI is better at it, and engineers are in danger of having to move in the direction of creating new things because creating new things is still difficult for AI.

- I think the Bullshit Job is crap, but I also think that the ethics of leisure and boredom means that humans can't stand to "do nothing", and from the current work ethic, there's no stopping the phenomenon of people continuing to do things that seem meaningful!
nishio
- Telling someone who is doing meaningless work that they don't have to do it because it doesn't make sense may be abusive (...)
Heat
- Surely you're not going to do anything.
- Solitary confinement is the most painful thing for a human being, isn't it?
Kosuke Miwa
- Dostoevsky said that the most painful torture is to make a person keep digging a hole and burying it.
- So I don't think anyone is doing something that they really don't mean, and that's why there's resistance to being called a bull shit job.

# Ken's summary
nishio
- The ideological part and the implementation part are the two wheels of the wheel, there are practical problems that come to light by building things, it is important to try many things and fail a lot, and to fail, it is important to try within safe limits.
- It's also bad to have the implementation go first and then bring in the ideology to justify it; it's important to have a balance between the two wheels."
- I wish you all the best in becoming a community of good failures."
