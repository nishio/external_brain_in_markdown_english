> In the ongoing debate about how government should regulate free speech, we shall consider how taxing human [[attention purchases]] might solve one of the key problems of purchasing mass circulation and converting financial capital into social and attention capital and political capital. Since the proceeds of this proposed tax on the exercise of power would be distributed proportionally to citizens, the exercise of economic power would directly result in a redistribution of power.
