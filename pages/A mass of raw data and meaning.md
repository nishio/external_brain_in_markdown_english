- Discussion on how to [[liquidate]] [[information]] in Scrapbox #Information organization
- Especially "20180525 notes" or "Notes from the 5th something meeting."
- This is "[[raw data]]" that I wrote down what I thought I should write down on the spot
- It's not formatted for me to read back to myself.
    - Not "[[reading matter]]"
        - The [[dull and uninteresting]] title is proof of this.
    - The reason it does not have a title that gives an idea of what is inside is that it is not yet a "[[semantic bundle]]" that can have a single title.
- So the first thing I do when I read back the "raw data" is prepare for the next time someone else reads it back to me.
    - To cut out a chunk of meaning and give it a title that is easy to understand.
    - If you're not comfortable rewriting or erasing raw data, leave that untouched.
    - On a new page, we can just extract the important parts.
- After the mass of meaning
    - It is only when it becomes a mass of meaning that it becomes "[[enlightened precepts]]" that come to life ([[even if]]).
    - Mr. Knowledge meets and becomes friends with related knowledge.
        - Link as in Scrapbox
        - For example, this page is tagged "organizing information".
        - Knowledgebase users can later find "pages with the same tags", i.e., "Knowledgebase users with the same interests", using the Scrapbox functionality.
    - Sometimes, knowledge kuns with differing opinions meet and spark new discussions.
        - As a result of discussions, they change slightly from each other or coalesce to create a new knowledge kun
            - Image of having a child
        - In this way, the society ([[Knowledge Network]]) is gradually developed and created.

- Putting a title on a collection of lines in Scrapbox is the same as putting a [[doorplate]] on a collection of sticky notes in the [[KJ method]] #Making a nameplate
