Divergence phase."
- On the phases of divergence and convergence
    - During the divergent phase, new ideas and information are freely explored and collected.
    - The convergence phase, on the other hand, integrates this information and narrows it down to specific goals.
    - The KJ method was originally intended for convergence, but is now also used for divergence. This is because if it is used exclusively for convergence, what is gained may be reduced. Also, when new ideas are generated, the convergence phase may be interrupted to perform divergence.
    - Difference between the early and late stages of the KJ method. In the early stages, we focused only on the convergence phase, but in the later stages, we came to believe that ideas can be generated in any phase.
    - Divergence and convergence are interrelated, with one complementing the other
    - These phases may be done consciously or unconsciously. This is because divergence and convergence are part of the natural process of thinking and creating.

About the phase of coming up with ideas
- There are three phases: "cultivate," "sprout," and "nurture."
    - In the plowing phase, information is collected and organized,
    - In the budding phase, we wait for new ideas,
    - The nurture phase involves testing and revising ideas.
- Q: How do the "cultivate," "sprout," and "nurture" phases relate to the divergence and convergence phases?

My research notes and Nishio's fragments allowed me to think deeply about the divergence and convergence phases. In the divergence phase, new ideas and information are freely explored and collected. The convergence phase, on the other hand, integrates this information and narrows it down toward a specific goal.

However, according to the fragment in Question 2, the KJ method was originally intended for convergence, but is now also used for divergence. This is because if it is used exclusively for convergence, what is gained may be reduced. Also, when new ideas are generated, the convergence phase may be interrupted to perform divergence.

The fragment "The Engineer's Intellectual Production Technique: A Reaction Summary" describes the phases of coming up with ideas. There are three phases to this: cultivate, sprout, and nurture. The cultivating phase involves gathering and organizing information, the sprouting phase involves waiting for new ideas, and the nurturing phase involves testing and revising ideas.

The fragment "KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork Q&A" explains the difference between the early and late phases of the KJ method. In the early stages, we focused only on the convergence phase, but in the later stages, we have come to believe that ideas can be generated in any phase.

Taking this information into account, we can say that divergence and convergence are interrelated, with one complementing the other. In addition, these phases may be conscious or unconscious. This is because divergence and convergence are part of the natural process of thinking and creating.

### Deep thoughts and questions

- How should the phases of divergence and convergence be balanced?
- How do the differences between early and late KJ methods affect our understanding of divergence and convergence?
- What is the difference between consciously and unconsciously performing the divergence and convergence phases?
- How do the "cultivate," "sprout," and "nurture" phases relate to the divergence and convergence phases?
