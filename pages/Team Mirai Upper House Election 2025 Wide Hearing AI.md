> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944313601051046328) This is an analysis of questions submitted to AI Anno, which answers questions 24 hours a day on YouTube. For the sake of convenience, I have categorized the questions into 20 categories, but in reality, there are a great variety of opinions.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1944314247053554035) The various questions would be more highlighted and easier to understand in this view, but it is a bit hard to see. I will make a correction to make it more visible after the election.
