["Ignore the Shareholders" -- Former Cybozu President's Innovation Theory Stuck in 'LUNARR' (1/2) - ITmedia News [http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/29/](http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/29/) news036.html]
> "If you interact with the [[capital market]], [[innovation]] will not happen 100%" //// If you want innovation, you should rather ignore the [[shareholder]].
- Hmmm.
- This reminded me of "[[If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have asked for a faster horse]]." It reminded me of "[[If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have asked for a faster horse]]" ([[Henry Ford]]).
    - What [Ford](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ヘンリー%E3%83%BBフォード) is saying, in essence, is "ignore the needs of your customers."
- That's difficult. I wonder if that's really the right thing to do.
- PS: Isn't "Ignore your customers' needs... I don't think "customers don't always know the best method to meet their needs." I see you don't ignore the need for "fast and comfortable transportation." But if a customer says, "I want a fast horse," you can't just take it literally and research fast horses.


- Youchan
    - Henry Ford said that customers don't always know what they want. <br>They cannot want something that is unknown to them in the first place. <br>I think this means that we should not listen to the voice of the customer, but rather give shape to what the customer really wants.
- coji
    - It's like "[[Two Shoe Sales]]". I think this is an important concept.
