Tell me what's better than MUI etc.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt5/icon' alt='gpt5.icon' height="19.5"/>To put it briefly, Chakra UI's strengths are that it is "design-agnostic, easy to learn, and super easy to handle dark colors." MUI (Material UI) has a very rich set of components and strong enterprise functionality. The choice of use depends on your purpose.
- Where Chakra is good
    - Design Neutrality: Since it does not depend on material standards, it can be easily adapted to the company's own design (can be handled as a "material" for appearance).
    - Consistency of API: size / variant / colorScheme and "style props" are almost unified. You can write without hesitation, and TypeScript completion is also effective.
    - Dark mode is standard: useColorMode() and tokens to switch color schemes at minimum cost.
    - Intuitive layout: Stack / HStack / VStack / SimpleGrid / Wrap for quick and easy "margins and alignment.
    - [[A11y]] and defaults are good: focus, keyboard operation, and ARIA are in place from the start and only require minor modifications.
    - Prototyping speed: Screens can be quickly built without writing CSS → Suitable for small to medium scale SaaS and PoC.
- Conversely, where MUI is strong
    - Wide range of components: DataGrid, pickers, Charts, and other "business-oriented" components are available (some for a fee).
    - Rich in materials and examples: multiple design systems, such as Material/ Joy, and many findings of corporate implementations.
    - For "fast and material compliant" projects: If the UI rules are decided first, MUI is less rework.
