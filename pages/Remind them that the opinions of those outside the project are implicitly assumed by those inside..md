Remind them that the opinions of those outside the project are implicitly assumed by those inside.

Opinion that "crowdfunding is often not feasible" in response to the plan to "crowdfund and create a board game.
- Whether the probability of that "often" is high or low, the perspective of "why crowdfunding?" was an eye-opener.
- I don't know how they decided to "crowdfund."
- I think that the accumulation of such "things that I can't explain why they were decided, but that I feel have already been decided and are no longer doubted" will lead to [[rigidification]] of the corporate organization.

This is because none of the project members are willing to take the financial risk.
- You could say I didn't "[[use one's own money]]."
- Surely the project will proceed speedily if someone spends their money and waits for the initial lot production costs.
    - We don't need all the discussion about what to do with the crowdfunding site, etc.
- On the other hand, that approach would mean that "only those who can take the financial risk can do the project.
- I'm interested in "[[a]] mechanism to create value from a group of people who are not willing to pay themselves."
