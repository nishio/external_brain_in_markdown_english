title: "Age and abstraction: three types of people"
---

SUMMARY: Consider three types of people whose abstraction changes with age and understand the characteristics and benefits of each.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>

    - [[Abstraction increases with age.]]
    - Some people seem to lose resolution with age and some don't.
    - There are three ways people think about the "lower resolution = higher abstraction" ability X
        - 1: Cannot acquire X
        - 2: Gain X to increase the level of abstraction.
            - This has great merit.
            - Meanwhile, the resolution goes down.
        - 3: Plus another skill Y can be acquired and raised or lowered.
            - Is it like this? I still don't see clearly what this is.
