title: "Outsourcing part of the work"
---

Interesting story about a company that introduced rules for [[outsourcing]] part of their work. There are various types of [[work-style reform]], and this kind of [[qualitative change]] is more interesting than a quantitative change that merely changes the amount of time.

[[Sales have increased due to the "outsource what you are not good at" rule and mandatory outsourcing of at least 50,000 yen per person per month.]]
