title: "Not all orders are present."
---

The "big/small relationships" and "order" that we experience in our daily lives are not necessarily established in general. This is an important perspective from which to understand phenomena beyond our framework of perception and thought.

- [[Large and small relationships do not exist.]]
    - [[The axis is not one-dimensional.]]
    - [[Correctness is not one-dimensional.]]
    - [[There is more than one strong and weak axis]]

A seemingly large or small relationship does not necessarily satisfy [[transitive verb]]. [Efron's dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice#Efron.27s_dice)
    - [[Efron's dice]]

Rock, paper, scissors, and rock-paper-scissors are designed and built in such a way that the "strength" does not artificially satisfy the transitive law.
- Pars are stronger than goo, chokes are stronger than pars, but goo is stronger than chokes. [[three strokes]]. Applied to game design.

### Summary of notes
.
Even those that at first glance appear to be large and small do not necessarily satisfy the transitive law. For example, Efron dice and rock-paper-scissors are designed so that they do not artificially satisfy the transitive law. These are applied to the design of games.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The notes and fragments "There is not always a total order," "The axis is not one-dimensional," and "Efron's dice" are relevant because they describe phenomena that do not establish transitive rules or large/small relationships. In particular, "Efron's Dice" is directly related to Efron's dice mentioned in the note.

### deep thinking
From these notes and fragments, it is possible to understand that the "small and large relationships" and "order" that we experience on a daily basis do not necessarily follow general laws. This is an important perspective from which to understand phenomena beyond the framework of our perceptions and thinking.
