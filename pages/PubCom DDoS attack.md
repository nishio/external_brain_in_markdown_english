> [Sankei_news](https://x.com/Sankei_news/status/1892205026602270766) [4,000 submissions using AI? 46 people, 10% of the total, most of them anti-nuclear, invited for opinions on basic energy plan - Sankei News [https://www.](https://www.) sankei.com/article/20250219-I4WUMKZPUFMO3O5G2BVP7KL7XY/]

>  The article "120,000 pubic comments on decontaminated soil" and "many with identical content" omits important background, which I will add.
>  So far, anti-nuclear activists have sent in a large number of pubic comments, and the reason for the 40 to 50 times increase this time from five years ago is activity by the conspiracy theory community.
>  As I have posted on X before, the conspiracy theory community supporting Senator Kazuhiro Haraguchi has been posting a lot of pubic comments.
>  Some of the pubic comments are given a game-like nature, with a high rating if the pubic comment is "Kiri number" such as 1000 or 2000.
>  These mass postings of conspiracy theories have made pubic commentary dysfunctional.
