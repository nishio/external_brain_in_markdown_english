- Kei strives to ask the right questions for the right keywords, but sometimes it makes mistakes. In such cases, there is a function that tells Kei that the question is not good enough.
    - The NGKW button tells you "Don't dig for this keyword.
        - It is a pretty strong imperative. The keyword will almost never be selected.
        - Assumed use case is when "w" in "seriously w" is selected as a keyword, and the "w" is removed from the candidate.
        - If you use this a lot early in the conversation, you will not be able to talk your way out of it.
    - The UPKW button tells you, "Dig deeper here than those keywords.
    - The NG button conveys a dissatisfied look to the program.
        - This is an emotional expression of "that's not a good question.
        - Even statements like "ummm..." are judged in the same way using machine learning.
        - This only inserts pictograms into the text field, but does not send them. You can also write additional messages.
        - I imagine it's something like, "I'll answer you with a disgruntled look on my face."
    - The adjacent smiley face mark has no particular function.
        - I put it on because it is unbalanced to be able to make a disgruntled face and not be able to smile.

### phase mode
.
- If you have a lot to talk about and want people to listen without asking questions first, type "listen first" and the program will go into phase mode.
- In the phase mode, you do not ask questions, you just phase.
- When you finish speaking, type "end" and the dialogue will begin with the input up to that point remembered.

### heartbeat
- If you have something you don't want to enter into the program but would like to log, start with open brackets to "speak your mind"!
