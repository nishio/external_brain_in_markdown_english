Wang Lixiong (Wang Lixiong, 1955- ) is a Chinese Tibetan writer and social activist. He is a [[nomad]] from [[nomad]], and his experiences have led him to speak out about traditional Tibetan culture and lifestyle, and the impact of Chinese government policies on Tibet.

Key Accomplishments:
- Tianzun" (1998): A novel based on the traditional Tibetan funeral rite of "bird burial. It depicts the depths of Tibetan culture.
- Xizang Book of Life and Death (2000): Reportage on the harsh natural environment of the Tibetan plateau and the life and death of the people living there.
- The Grassland Zoo" (2007): A satirical film that uses animal motifs to depict the impact of China's economic development on the environment and the lives of nomads in Tibet.
In his work, Wang Lixiong criticizes the Chinese government's [[resettlement policy]] and resource development as threatening the traditional [[nomadic lifestyle]] of [[Tibet]]. He also points out problems with ethnic policies such as the suppression of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and restrictions on Tibetan language education.

On the other hand, he does not support the Tibetan independence movement and takes the position of seeking a symbiotic relationship between Tibet and China. He is seeking a way for Tibet to develop as part of China while preserving Tibet's cultural identity.

Wang Lixiong's thought has the uniqueness of rethinking the Tibetan problem from a nomadic perspective. Although not directly related to [[Deleuze.]]'s [[nomadic theory]], there is some overlap with Deleuzean problem setting in that it highlights the tension between the state and nomadism.
