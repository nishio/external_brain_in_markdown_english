            - Marx thought that the mode of production was the economic substructure and that changing it would change the ideological superstructure of the state, but it did not
            - As a result, the idea that the conceptual superstructure of the state is independent of the substructure was strengthened.

- Traditionally, when people overcooked vegetables and food, they would "[[share]]" them.
    - In return for this is the exchange form A
- As for digital goods, the cost of copying is low, so you can make what you want and then "share" it with the rest of the world.
    - This is the occurrence of [OSS
    - However, in the modern era, when [[exchange form C]], the exchange of goods, is common, there is no "giving back" based on exchange form A to the author of the OSS
    - In other words, the problem can be described as "the dysfunction of Mode of Exchange A in a society where Mode of Exchange C is the norm.
    - So Form D, which is "to experience Form C and then return to the higher A," is the solution.
    - Related: [[How to deal with the tragedy of shared lands in OSS]].
