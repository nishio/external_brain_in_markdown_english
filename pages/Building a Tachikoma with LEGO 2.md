This time, we only discuss and order. Next time [[Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 3]].

Next, I would like to improve the carry part with reference to [[3x3 plate belly Tachikoma]].
I'll make it with 4 or 5.
    - [[reverse slope]] has 1x2 and 2x2
    - Two of both is all that is needed.
    - [https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1069349&csid=0](https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1069349&csid=0)
- The top is [[Slope Curve 1 x 4 Double]], but the blue one is sold out.
    - [https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1067304&csid=20&page=2](https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1067304&csid=20&page=2)
    - I'd buy four 2x2s and two 1x2s.
- We don't have a lot of regular blue parts on hand either.
    - Lots of 1x4 plates only.
    - 2x4, 2x3, 1x2, 1x3 plates
    - 1x2-4 block
    - I wonder how many we need.
- Also need red transparent 1x1 panel
    - Do you want two, four, or a 1x2 panel?
- The 90 degree conversion for the dish on the side is not likely to be a front light.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/2217cfb2e40926865633917710e8165c/thumb/1000)
    - 1x1 block technique Pinhole?
    - Is that necessary? Is [[headlight]] sufficient?
    - Dish is 2x2
- The one that grabs, there are many if you don't ask about the color, but maybe there wasn't a blue one...
    - The person being grabbed also needs to be
    - Vertical clip and handle
        - [https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=924637&csid=0](https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=924637&csid=0)

- I like the fact that the root of the gatling is 1x1...
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/c18b1870832db924d7ec73140713d1f8/thumb/1000)
    - But mine is even, so I'll have to get creative.
        - [[Technique Block 1 x 1]]

I like this one best for the legs.

        - [[1x4 Curved Slope Leg Tachikoma]]
- carry
    - Is Dish stabbing [[T-pipe]]?

        - [[grill]] I'm using it. It's cool.

        - [https://www.brickers.jp/?pid=24384699](https://www.brickers.jp/?pid=24384699)
        - I have the grill on hand if it's black or gray.
    - Slope curves seem to be used in abundance for rounded forms.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/a596eab0a40a9da5860fdcdb863b0b7f/thumb/1000)
        - I can't read what kind of structure...
        - You haven't acquired a vocabulary of curved surface representation because you don't have many slope curves on hand to begin with.
- leg
    - Curves are slope curve 1x4

        - Four for now.
    - Are the tires connected by "[[Plate 1 x 2 - end small ball socket]]"?
        - I can get about four ball sockets out of my hand.
        - The problem is the tire side, how it's connected.
            - I wonder if [[Axis-Ball]] will work.
    - I'm not sure about the base of the foot side either.
        - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e420b374e21dc6ac24045b1f2a6440fa/thumb/1000)
        - Where do the balls grow from?
            - I wonder if [[Axis-Ball]] is stuck in "[[Technique Block 1 x 2 - Cross Shaft Hole]]".
        - On top of that [[Slope Curve 2 x 2]]?
        - I'm thinking "Bracket 1 x 2 / 2 x 2 - Reverse]" to convert it, plus a slope curve.
        - I'm not even sure how it's connected to the torso.
- How the eyeballs are fixed at an angle is also a mystery.
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b00d7162bb59a7f1a81dd14d64ea8976/thumb/1000)
    - Slope looks like 30 degrees, but it doesn't stick.
            - [[Slope 30°- 1 x 2 x 2/3]]
    - Don't tell me the white circle on the side is holding it down?
        - No, the side eyes don't have the white circles on the sides, so that's different.
    - No way... glue...
        - Well, it's not a lot of money since it's only a $60 part with three $20 ones attached.
        - If I can't come up with a solution, so be it.
    - I was wondering if the white part of the eyeball is a tile or a dish without studs, but I see the bottom part of this.
        - [[Round Plate Plate 2 x 2 Round Bottom]]
- The small eye root on the side is [[Side stud block]], not [[headlight]], maybe.
        - [[Side Stud Block Block 1 x 1 - 1 Side Stud]]
- Gatling's part
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/e279e211e2a02eba54d9c519e9ee536d/thumb/1000)
    - I think the root is a ball joint, but if you connect the ball to the cross axis, the rounds would be scuffed, so I'm not sure if it's a pin.
