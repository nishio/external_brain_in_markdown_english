title: "Problem Solving Phase"
---

- 0: Somewhat troubled but unable to verbalize
- 1: Can verbalize what is troubling you but cannot come up with a solution
- 2: Comes up with a solution but does not try (lack of time or confidence)
- 3: Try and fail and lose heart
... and I thought about the ladder halfway through.

- 4: Tried and failed and "something doesn't work" = 0
- 5: I can verbalize why it doesn't work but can't come up with a solution = 1
- 6: I can come up with a solution, but...
and enter the second cycle.
