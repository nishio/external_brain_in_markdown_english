- What is "useful?"
- Choose from several [[options]] that you think would be "useful
    - This "would be useful" is [[interpretation]].
- We know that the knowledge that produced the choice is useful when, after choosing and executing it, [[posterior]] we actually obtain a useful result.
    - I thought it needed a little work because it was [[circular referencing]], but I also felt that it would be good if it was useful even if it was circular referencing.

relevance
    - [[reinforcement learning]]
    - [[intersubjective]]
