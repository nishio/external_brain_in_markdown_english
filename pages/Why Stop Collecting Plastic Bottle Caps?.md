Started around 2005 and stopped collecting in 2020.
> 45 yen/1Kg at the beginning of 2016, since October 2016 30 yen/1Kg as of December 2019 less than 20 yen/1Kg, the previous donation of 5 yen/1Kg has been changed to 2 yen/1Kg for a while (from Alpha Japan's website below).

>  Roughly 1 million caps were collected in FY 2019. The amount donated for vaccines by these 1 million caps is 11,000 yen.

> Of course, we understand that there are those who still have opinions about this project and would like to continue it. Please collect at least 50 kilograms (7 45-liter garbage bags) of caps and contact the PET bottle cap collection office in Alpha Japan below.... . It seems that the caps weighing less than 100 kilograms now require 1,000 yen per cap, but could you please ask them to collect them directly here?
