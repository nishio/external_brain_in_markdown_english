    - [[Knowledge of the listener]] is represented by a large circle.
    - [[change]] is represented by an arrow.
- A
    - If the starting and ending points of the change are within the knowledge of the listener
    - The listener feels that there is "no [[novelty (patentability)]]"
- B
    - If the starting point of the change is within the listener's knowledge and the ending point is outside the range
    - Listeners feel "novelty".
- C
    - If the starting and ending points of the change are outside the scope of the listener's knowledge
    - Listeners feel "unfamiliar".
- Whether the listener perceives it as "novelty" or not ([[Subjective novelty]]) depends on the listener's knowledge.
    - The problem arises when this listener is in a position to decide on the evaluation of the change.
        - Problems arise when raters rate C lower than B
        - [[The Dilemma of Novelty Evaluation]]
