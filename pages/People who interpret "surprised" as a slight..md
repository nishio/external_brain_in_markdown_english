title: 'People who interpret "surprised" as a slight.'
---

Some people see the statement, "I'm surprised to see such a question on a question site," and interpret it as "poking fun at the questioner."

When I saw this, I was about to write in a [[boomerang joke]] kind of mood, "I'm surprised that someone would interpret the expression "surprised" as being made fun of," but I decided not to because it would be interpreted as "more people making fun of me" no matter what I thought, and that would be a pain in the ass.
