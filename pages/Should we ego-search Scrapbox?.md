It seems right that Scrapbox is designed to "not add features that are easy to do".
- see [/shokai/ Eliminate all features that lead to the stimulation of approval](https://scrapbox.io/shokai/ Eliminate all features that lead to the stimulation of approval).
    - > I'm doing Scrapbox to create a tool to formulate thoughts.
- Why is it "right" to create "[[Tools to develop your thinking]]", because it is likely to produce actions that are not fit for purpose.
    - Purpose is a prerequisite
    - Well, I personally would like a thought-provoking tool as well.
