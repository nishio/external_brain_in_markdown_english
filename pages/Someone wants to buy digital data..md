Someone wants to buy [[digital data]].

Surprisingly, there's talk of buying digital data from [[C3: Computer Created Cats]], so I'm trying to sort it out.
- ✅ [[C3: Computer Created Cats Digital Data Purchase]]

I haven't thought of a payment method.
- Well, I thought we could communicate after the application was submitted.
- I'm writing in Japanese because I'm trying to communicate.

What would you do if you were open to the world?
- I don't want to go back and forth.
- [[Patreon]] [https://www.patreon.com](https://www.patreon.com) or something like that.
- Even for a second [[Github Sponsor]] came to mind, but then I thought, "Aren't you going to release the source code?" And that's what I'm going to be talking about.
    - It's not the source code that's producing, it's the images.
    - Github is misleading.
