> The advice "I can't do that" or "I can't do that" is appreciated, but it is not very valuable. It only leads to discouragement and "I knew you couldn't do it.
> A "good lawyer" should identify specific things that can be done, not things that cannot be done. And if you can present ideas for things that are often considered "impossible" or "difficult," you will be a creative lawyer. The lawyer must understand the true meaning of the other party's question, and then present a strategy for realizing the request.
> When the timing is perfect, the advice can be of immense value. A good lawyer is a navigator who takes into account the entire set of rules applicable to the situation and reveals the direction in which it is possible to move forward.
