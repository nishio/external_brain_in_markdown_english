Personal Information Management (PIM)
Keeping Found Things Found" (2007) by William Jones provides an overview of how personal information management tools and methods help users store and reuse information, and is helpful in considering GTD-like "indelible" records and reusability.


William Jones「Keeping Found Things Found (KFTF)」：
This book systematically outlines strategies and tools to help people "retain the information they find in a condition that can be used again later.
Relation to GTD:
- In GTD, "taking it out of your head and storing it somewhere safe" gives you peace of mind that you will not lose the information.
- Jones' research shows that such externalized information storage (digital memos, bookmarking, tagging, etc.) reduces human cognitive load and provides easy access to information when needed.
- By referring to this PIM-like strategy, the AI can create a mechanism that goes beyond mere task enumeration and reorganizes information in a way that can always be found later.
