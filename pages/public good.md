title: "public good"
---

When translating into Japanese, you can either translate "[[public good]]" or "[[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]]".
- When goods is used as a countable noun, it means [[goods]].
    - It's a katakana word for "goods."
- In Japanese, it's hard to get the message across because it's perceived as "good=good" and "goods=things.
