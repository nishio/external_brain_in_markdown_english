[[people waiting for instructions]] don't [[volunteer]].

At the reception for the Unexplored Jr.
- Was this the context in which Mentor finished dismantling and shipping the monitors for the demonstration without a specific command order?
- It would have been much harder if all we had were people waiting for instructions."
- People who wait for instructions wouldn't volunteer to be mentors in the first place."
- Well, sure!"
The story that follows.
- 'Why are we having so much fun at the drinking table, doing things like work?'
- We're [[problem-solving geeks]], so [[problem-solving]] is [[a]] good drink."

The concept of "volunteer" is a little more detailed.
- A: Someone who acts [[spontaneous]] to solve problems
- B: People who want to "volunteer" or be "volunteer themselves".
- C: People who do not want to volunteer but are forced to do so by some kind of coercive force.

Of course, the "volunteer" here is referring to A.
- B is [[awaiting instructions]], and C is not doing as much as possible when instructed to do so.
