I'm home PC!
- As of yesterday, I was home, but didn't have the energy to open my computer.

Doing.
- Transcribe notes from Tweet during the gubernatorial election to Cosense
    - Summary of [Daimine Climbing 2024
    - I guess this one comes first.


[Ryo Fukawa: "I wonder if Mr. Ishimaru can order Subway" post echoes "As expected" and "I can picture the scene in my mind" (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News [https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/04bef0150aa768b39410b6f7a6a7679](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/04bef0150aa768b39410b6f7a6a7679) f7d8f88b8]
> The topic of conversation on social networking sites is the "irreconcilable" exchange between Shinji Ishimaru, 41, former mayor of Akitakada City in Hiroshima Prefecture, and sociologist Kenju Furuichi, 39, who is running for the Tokyo gubernatorial election on April 7, on a live YouTube streaming program on NTV. Fukawa, perhaps using Mr. Ishimaru as an excuse, wondered if Mr. Ishimaru could order Subway. The post received over 2 million views as of 5:00 p.m. on August 8...

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1810332038035341656) The preview system and Japanese patch for #BroadListening that I made with #Takahiro Yasuno's team will be released and I will write an article about it in Note by the end of the week. I'm planning to release the source code and write an article about it in Note by the end of this week.

> [DShuhari](https://x.com/DShuhari/status/1810113177096786095) "Team Yasuno" met yesterday around 6pm and had a KPT that lasted over 4 hours.
>
>  ZOOM was also connected, and it was an amazing view to see over 50 people who participated in the event share their achievements and challenges one by one in a time where everyone was looking to the future and making flat out recommendations to each other. This is the kind of thing that makes us a really great team.

> [nanatakamatsu](https://x.com/nanatakamatsu/status/1810130314146222283) I think it is not right to criticize young people who put in for Mr. Ishimaru but not Mr. Ishimaru. I do not support Mr. Ishimaru, but I think the young people who went to the election are great, no matter who they put in. I would like to commend them for their political participation. I think voters just need to grow as they vote. ...

>  (I once went there when I was called in to do an interview, only Yasuno spent two hours without a camera pointed at me...)...

> [rinakuro](https://x.com/rinakuro/status/1810108722678808601) ▼The answer I received when I asked the station staff "Why don't you air Yasuno on TV?" (When I was called in for an interview and they didn't show it)
>
>  ・Viewers are interested in political battles, not policies
>  ・If I cut my hair, I'll think about it.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1810093846795350525) Blaming others for not doing what you expect them to do because "they are XX" will only widen the division and not improve things. We need to think about how we can cooperate with "people who think differently.

> [nomikaishiyouze](https://x.com/nomikaishiyouze/status/1809959919631962532) Regardless of whose camp you're in, it's an election campaign, but I thought it was social movement-like. So I felt I was familiar with it, and I also felt that a lot of people were no longer resistant to the social movement methodology, but whether that's good for the election as a whole is another thing.

> [t_yano](https://x.com/t_yano/status/1809965532994523636) By the way, now that the election is over, I'd like you to clarify if those are or are not violations of the Public Offices Election Law. To be frank, if it is not a violation, that's fine. I want you to come to a clear conclusion.
>  Is it a violation? Is it not a violation? The situation is unhealthy, so if it's not a violation, then "any camp can do the same thing in the future!"

> [YashinNoMeisou](https://x.com/YashinNoMeisou/status/1809949078337507444) I thought it was a launch, but 3 or 4 hours of stiff KPT? That was too much fun.

> [numagasa](https://x.com/numagasa/status/1809920894929875199) On nights when I am disappointed with the election results (well, almost every time), I reread the book "Hope in the Darkness". The course of history is complex, and no one knows what will affect it and how it will lead to sudden and major changes. Hope can be discouraging in its own way, but it is still worth having, and I admire those who act without giving up hope and imagination.

> [kumagai_chiba](https://x.com/kumagai_chiba/status/1809935961297707050) Yasuno, I have been paying attention. The fact that these candidates are coming up is a positive sign of the changing times.

> [snowdance87](https://x.com/snowdance87/status/1809911917512990809) Mr. Hori and Ms. Izumi "did not talk about the policies of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government," and Mr. Anno talked the most about his vision of what he wants Tokyo to become. He was also rated number one by a third-party evaluation organization. The media should have conveyed this kind of information.
>  >snowdance87: MC Hori: "Where's Mr. Yasuno I was focusing on?" Mr. Izumi: "If the media had picked up on Mr. Yasuno, he might have come in here." x.com/snowdance87/st...


> [snowdance87](https://x.com/snowdance87/status/1809906880933974192) MC Mr. Hori said, "Which part of Ms. Yasuno did I focus on?" Ms. Izumi: "If the media had picked up on Ms. Yasuno, she might have come in here."
>  >snowdance87: I thought it was very nice that Fusaho Izumi called for people to vote now because there is still time. I think there were only 3 women out of 14 people.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809913353344897089) Something about going up the stairs and saying, "What's with all the clapping? What's going on?" When I opened the door, the interview was about to start and I was scared.
>  >uudaiy: I thought they were just gathering to watch the preliminary vote count over drinks, so I bought my own drinks and went to the meeting place, but they were having a KPT-style review meeting, and they were all too stoic.


> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809904632568914040) I'm home Tokyo! How did the election turn out?

> [amachang](https://x.com/amachang/status/1809868540171940300) I seriously recommend the election. You don't have to be empty handed, the UI and the lines are relatively smooth, you'll feel like you've done something good in about a minute, you can enter local facilities, and for some reason, a lot of people greet you and make you feel like a human being.

> [nanatakamatsu](https://x.com/nanatakamatsu/status/1809878451207438758) I get a lot of calls saying "I went to the election! I am very happy because I am working to encourage young people to participate in politics!

> [nikkei](https://x.com/nikkei/status/1809739289560813910) Record number of people cast ballots in advance for Tokyo gubernatorial election, key to independents.

>  Up to 2.15 million Tokyo Governors voted before polling day, returning up to 2:2.

- [[Proposal to allow minors to participate in politics]]
> [kenn](https://x.com/kenn/status/1809597036666450227) In the end, I decided to vote for Yasuno.
>
>  I'm not so interested in the Tokyo metropolitan government that I wouldn't care if it was Yuriko. I'm not interested in Tokyo politics as much as I'd like to be, but I don't think it's right to vote for Yuriko either.
>
>  Considering what it means to use one's time to vote, there is no point in putting in a candidate whose results will be the same whether one votes or not.
>
>  It is like a choice by process of elimination.
>  >Kenn: Yasuno, of course I support you as an individual, but I felt that you should be attentive to the argument that politics fosters division when it is pushed through by technocracy. As Sandel says, the current dire situation in the US was born out of populism as a reaction to the "arrogance of meritocracy".

> [shuzonarita](https://x.com/shuzonarita/status/1809598139206336862) That's a great speech by Mr. Anno's wife. The content of "Anno doesn't undermine people but sees flaws in the system" is also great because it describes Anno in a nutshell, and I love that she's speaking from the heart.

> [catmonky007](https://x.com/catmonky007/status/1809598362494333125) It seems unexpected for many influencers that Yasuno-san, who was thought to be impossible because folks are stupid, became popular and grew on X. Social networking is a good thing. Good things spread quickly, so you just need to know if it's good or not. It's time to get rid of assumptions like the average person is stupid.

> [nabe_yas1985](https://x.com/nabe_yas1985/status/1809568862675038505) For the Tokyo gubernatorial election, after considering candidates who will update Japanese politics from all angles, #TakahiroYasuno is the only choice! If you read the manifesto of Yasuno's candidate, you will understand that the existing political parties that can only position the Tokyo gubernatorial election as a prelude to a power struggle in national politics are now expired!
>  >[nabe_yas1985](https://x.com/nabe_yas1985/status/1803774583801356295) For the Tokyo gubernatorial election, I am supporting #Takahiro Yasuno, a completely independent candidate whose policies I share, a little. The posters are completely volunteer, so I'm putting up posters little by little around our neighborhood. In my own election, I paid to outsource the work to a contractor, so I'm having a hard time locating the billboards at all (laughs).

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809597668685144144) If you are going to vote for someone you don't want to vote for some reason, is that "reason" really correct? Isn't that "reason" something that someone who is convenient for you to believe in has led you to believe? Please stop and think before you cast your vote. Voting is an opportunity to express your will.

> [UniTamagos](https://x.com/UniTamagos/status/1809451334397227158) Let's make the #Governor's race the best turnout in history!
>  # Make Takahiro Yasuno Governor of Tokyo
>  I feel the future is brighter than it has been in a long time, so I will vote for Ms. Anno.
>  >rink_ui: I think it is better to vote for the candidate who has given me so much excitement than to vote for the candidate who has given me so much excitement and who will be the one I want in 4 or 8 years, when both supporters of Renho and Shinji Ishimaru are pulling each other down and criticizing each other for violating the public election, and both are not in the race, and I am only +1 for Koike who is an incumbent and has done a good job. So I will vote for Takahiro Yasuno tomorrow.


> I was asked by Mr. Yasuno to give a campaign speech at the closing of his microphone in Yurakucho, but I was so scared of the large audience that I declined. I was in charge of GitHub. #Takahiro Yasuno #TOKYOAI

> [uudaiy](https://x.com/uudaiy/status/1809544873504305628) Regardless of the direction, I think it would be a very good thing for Tokyo if many people listened to various people, took time to research, and went to speeches to decide what the future of Tokyo should be like and who they should vote for. I think that in itself is a very good thing for Tokyo.

> [seby_jp](https://x.com/seby_jp/status/1809474618148942277) I voted for #Takahiro Yasuno! Thanks to Mr. Yasuno, I can now think positively about politics, which I didn't want to get close to and which was hazy and unfamiliar to me. The manifesto is coherent with easy-to-understand explanations. Concrete measures, data, and rationale.

> [Btaros](https://x.com/Btaros/status/1809531235037016175) Team Yasuno really has a strong will to make the election process open and something that everyone can be involved in. The open source philosophy that the world will be a better place by making something good and releasing it to the public for everyone to use. It is like looking at the goodness of the Internet generation.

> [PPstudyDWE](https://x.com/PPstudyDWE/status/1809470976067006564) After this consideration, I voted for the candidate whose recommendation I would like to entrust Tokyo's future to.
>
>  There have been some polling places that close before 20:00 on the last day of voting even if it says that the polls are open until 20:00, so it is a good idea to vote before the deadline or early in the daytime on the same day.

>  >PPstudyDWE: I'm going around in circles again, deciding whether to vote for a strong opponent of someone I don't want to see elected or for a candidate I'd like to entrust with Tokyo politics (who will probably get a dead vote), but no matter how many times I think about it, my motto is "Push for a candidate when you can"...remember? That's what I'm saying, isn't it?


> [gakuto_akashi](https://x.com/gakuto_akashi/status/1809404599746646057) I voted for Ms. Anno before the deadline. When Audrey Tan from Taiwan was talked about, I think a lot of people posted on Twitter at the time that they wished someone like her would appear in Japan. Now is the time. I did not vote for her as a long-hair lover, so please understand that.

> [AyumiHirose3](https://x.com/AyumiHirose3/status/1809572048202776733) Mr. Yasuno with Team Yasuno, in just one month, has transformed the election process into one that allows residents to be constructively involved in the policy process itself. It is not only that they have changed the process of election to "one in which a single resident can be constructively involved in the policy itself,

> [Btaros](https://x.com/Btaros/status/1809502207714423301) I am glad that #Takahiro Yasuno ran for #Governor of Tokyo. I only helped him as a friend by making manifestos and distributing posters, but I'm glad I was able to be involved in his campaign.

> [h_okumura](https://x.com/h_okumura/status/1809566548241338516) I don't know if my space-time is distorted, but most people seem to vote for Takahiro Yasuno.

> [ttakeaki](https://x.com/ttakeaki/status/1809576181714546918) The applause when his wife appeared was the star of the show. Hearing Takahiro Yasuno's campaign from his wife's point of view, I thought it was dramatic. From the beginning when two people were trying to put up 200 posters, to putting up all 14,000 locations with the help of volunteers, it was nothing short of impressive. #Takahiro Yasuno #Takahiro Yasuno for Governor #Tokyo gubernatorial election campaign

> [hazuma](https://x.com/hazuma/status/1809481996051312664) The Tokyo gubernatorial election was full of ridiculous candidates, but among them, Mr. Anno, who had no organization and started out as a nobody, stuck to his own path to the end and did not do anything strange to increase his name recognition, is important not only for the future gubernatorial elections but for the Japanese elections as a whole. I think it is important not only for future gubernatorial elections but also for Japanese elections as a whole to see how far Mr. Anno can go.

> [YoshifumiSeki](https://x.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1809561588892090564) How straight-forward is Mr. Yasuno that I, with my bad character, can't think of anything bad to say?

He talked about his future prospects and specific policies without making any disparaging remarks about the other candidates, which convinced me that he really doesn't have any connections, and it was amazing that that many people took him seriously.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809383264878227864) Frankly, the anti-Koike vote is being fought over by Renho and Ishimaru, and there is no way to unite them, and in a political battle they would just tell each other to "put it in here, not there. I'm fed up with that kind of thing. In the sense of vote consolidation, I think that Ms. Anno is the best candidate because she will attract all the voters who think, "I am fed up with such things, let's discuss policy rather than politics.
>  >fbythesea: I'm wondering intensely whether I should give up on the incumbent's unassailable advantage and put in someone I like (Yasuno-san), hoping for the next time even though I think the time is still a little bit not ripe, or whether I should prioritize consolidating my vote because I don't know yet.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1809384611925102844) The forces that are competing with each other for votes are conspicuous because they are loud, but since they are competing with each other and not cohesive, in fact, the best move in this situation is to build up competence and performance without hesitation, In fact, in this situation, the best move would be to build up competence and accomplishments without hesitation.

However, as this Mr. Yasuno states, it is a pity that the central political situation is brought into the gubernatorial election and there is no policy debate. If I were a Tokyoite, I might want to vote for him.

I'm putting in Ms. Anno because Ms. Koike is going to win anyway. If Mr. Ishimaru is in a close race, I will put Mr. Ishimaru to win, but my thought is closer to Mr. Anno. Mr. Yasuno, you said you won't be vice-governor, but I definitely want you to be involved in some way, as a chief strategist or something.

The number of votes is actually increasing explosively.

>  The 218th Tokyo Gubernatorial Election: Who are the "Other" Candidates of Concern in the Upcoming Election?
>  The Tokyo gubernatorial election has been making headlines in a different way, with posters posted in violation of public order and morals. The election will finally take place this weekend, and will the incumbent governor be reelected, or will a new candidate win? Mr. Murakami focuses on the people he is interested in.





> [MinatoNakazawa](https://x.com/MinatoNakazawa/status/1809372128388739346) Mr. Abe, since you wrote this post, I was a little excited about the Wake Up's coverage of the gubernatorial election, but they did not mention Mr. Anno at all. I don't know if there was some kind of tie-up with the station or what. I don't know if there was some kind of binding from the station, but was it limited to specific policies or mentioning the Waseda Manifesto Institute ([https://maniken.online/kurabeteerabu/)?](https://maniken.online/kurabeteerabu/)?)
>  >[toshikiabe](https://x.com/toshikiabe/status/1804738720802980328) The service called "trapro" launched by Riddilava in 2013 was exactly the kind of service that aimed to allow users to present social issues and have them discussed over and over again. I was very moved to see Yasuno's election as governor of Tokyo after 10 years had passed. Personally, I am very deeply moved. And coming up on that GitHub.


> [taberunosuki525](https://x.com/taberunosuki525/status/1809372221661757504) I'm here and I want to know more about Mr. Anno too but the media doesn't report on him at all so I'll do my own social media research today anyway. I'm getting tired of all the cussing and the Tokyo gubernatorial race...

> [izki_toyama](https://x.com/izki_toyama/status/1809373395504754712) The governor of Japan's capital, Tokyo, will be decided tomorrow. I was not interested in this gubernatorial election because there was no policy debate at all. However, as this Mr. Yasuno states, it is a pity that the central political situation is brought into the gubernatorial election and there is no policy debate. If I were a Tokyoite, I might want to vote for him.

I'm not sure if I should put in Yuriko to stop Renho or Yasuno-san who is a decent member of society.

> [omochi_536](https://x.com/omochi_536/status/1809378582420132038) Holly said many times that no one reads all of Mr. Anno's manifesto, but I think there are rather a few who do. People are thinking about who they want to entrust their future to. Even if they don't have time, they will take the time to read the manifestos. The people of Tokyo are not that stupid.

It oozes from this article that it is hard for an individual candidate to fight as a complete independent. I hope you all know a little bit about the process.

If it turns out that "there are so many people who expect technology to be used in government," I think that direction will grow and Yasuno's team will be able to play an active role.

I was astonished to hear that the election officials give the information about the location of those election poster boards to the voters in a huge amount of paper!

There were a lot of highly educated people in the group, but for whatever reason, it was Asahara who brought them all together and kept them in line. Sarin and everything else was created by Asahara's leadership. Asahara needs to be seriously analyzed again.

And it is not limited to Japan.

- [[Argument compared to Hitler]] is now often seen
- I haven't decided if this is a yes or a no.
- I'm not doing this because I think it's a violation of Anno policy to RT.
- Comparing bad social phenomena of the past with those of today to prevent bad things from happening is in the public interest.

There's no guarantee that any of them will be around next year. More than that, I think the really significant point of this gubernatorial election is that Ishimaru's supporters in 2nd place are in their 2-30's and Renho's supporters in 3rd place are older people.

If you read the forecast note, you would know that this gubernatorial election is quite historic if we focus on the bubble candidates, and the 1st to 4th place of the all-time ranking of the number of votes received by bubble candidates is about to be updated this time. Moreover, there is almost no TV exposure for those candidates. Television's divine power has declined more than we thought.

It is unfortunate that the vote did not increase, but I would like to believe that there were many Tokyo residents who voted strategically, choosing among those who had a chance of winning.

> [ShinHori1](https://x.com/ShinHori1/status/1809946162054803760) People are afraid that Mr. Ishimaru got a large number of votes only because of his novelty image, but if you think about it, the old innovative metropolitan government, the Hosokawa administration, the Koizumi administration, the former Democratic Party administration, and other major political transformations were also realized because they attracted the masses who jumped at such novelty. But then again, I wonder if the big political changes of the past, such as the innovative Tokyo metropolitan government, the Hosokawa administration, the Koizumi administration, and the former Democratic Party of Japan, were also realized because they captured the masses who jumped at the novelty of such things.

However, many voters do not think Koike is evil at all, so the Renho camp may not have reached the starting line, let alone the goal line, as they thought.

The campaign is a mess, as it declares, "Voters who want to be thought of as smart people (are voting for Yasuno)." Based on the polls, they say that Yasuno has no chance of winning the election and should be the second best candidate, but if polls were all that mattered, there would be no need for an election.

I think #Takahiro Yasuno is the best choice for the current generation who are fed up with the ideology of national political parties. If a politician who uses technology to reflect the will of the people in his policies gets 300,000 votes, the politics of Japan as a whole will change.
