- t0~t1: First, a mock-up is made to share the image of what is planned to be created.
        - The content with [[uncertainty]] is determined at random.
    - If you don't have the data you need, make it up as you go along.
    - We're ready to release it! No, no, no, we haven't even got the content yet!"
    - > For Mr. X, who last time said "I'm ready to release it," let me explain the current situation by comparing it to building a new condominium. I thought this was the 'back door'. I thought this "back door" route would be better suited for letting people flow in the real thing, right? So now we are modifying the design of the corridors and water pipes in the production apartments.
    - >  The model room was fairly clean, but the production condo is not ready to move in because the toilet still doesn't flush.
- t1~t2: As we proceed with the logic implementation, we find that many things are different from our initial assumptions.
    - Or that the data you need can't be obtained by the means you originally expected.
    - You forgot that there's other data that should be displayed, and there's no display field in the UI.
    - They are resolved ad hoc, so the appearance is worse once they are resolved.
        - The priority is the implementation of the content, so no effort is put into the appearance of the product.
    - > I did some major surgery and all the type errors disappeared! I thought I had it all, but when I ran it, X didn't define the type, so that's where I got stuck, come to think of it. I thought I had connected all the water pipes, but there were some checks missing, so the toilet sewer line is connected, but the water supply is not, so I can't flush.
    - several days later
        - > I'm experimenting with data while fixing the "water pipes are connected and working, but sometimes water leaks".
- t2~t3: Once the logic is complete, the appearance can be improved.
    - There's a lot less uncertainty, so it's a speedy process.
    - Now that the implementation of the inside is done and my hands are free, I can use the time to improve the look and feel of the product.
    - In terms of condominiums, you can move in at least once, and you can stick to the interior design phase.

    - [[Make it messy anyway.]]
    - [[First of all, a messy one.]]
- In a sense, we can say that we are creating [[prototype]] at the t1 stage and then destroying it while implementing t2.
