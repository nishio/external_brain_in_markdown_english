- [[social common capital]] ([[Social Common Capital]]) Overview
- Concepts to complement the shortcomings of capitalism (e.g., inequality)
- Protect and manage resources and institutions essential to people's lives in a public and regional manner, rather than leaving them to the market.
- Health and medical care, education, natural resources, and infrastructure are typical examples.

Background and Advocacy
- Advocated by the late speaker's father ([[Hirofumi Uzawa]])
- Developed a philosophy that emphasizes the "human mind" even though he is an economist
- While at the University of Chicago, interacted with Joseph Stiglitz, George Akerlof, Milton Friedman, and others

Capitalism and Social Common Capital
- Market economy encourages innovation, but creates inequality and price gouging
- If important social infrastructure (healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc.) is left solely to the pursuit of profit, there is a risk that it will become unavailable to all.
- A system is needed to "protect what is necessary for everyone in the community and government."

Specific examples and applications
- New Corona Reaffirms Importance of Medical Care
- Inequity will increase if the environment (natural resources, air, water) and infrastructure (roads, water, electricity, internet) are treated only by market principles.
- Relevance to SDGs: Social common capital can play a role in linking multifaceted goals like the SDGs

Current Trends in Economics and Related
- Adam Smith's "[[moral emotivism]]": emphasis on empathy and cultural foundations
- [[John Stuart Mill's "steady state"]]: a prosperous society can be established without economic growth.
- Uzawa's Mathematical Economics: Analyzing social common capital using mathematical methods while being aware of the limitations of economics (neglect of non-priced value, limitations of imagination)

Future Outlook
- Research is being continued and developed at Kyoto University and other universities.
- Examples of results in nature restoration agriculture (e.g., savanna reforestation): Exploring the compatibility of economic growth with the environment and society
- Shift from quantity to quality (a society that pursues peace, beauty, and happiness, not competition)
- The power of art: countering the negative aspects of capitalism and making people aware of nature and beauty, as in the case of [[Naoshima]].

summary
- Social common capital is a public mechanism to "leave no one behind".
- An important perspective to harmonize efficiency and competition promoted by capitalism with humanity and the natural environment.
- Interested parties are welcome: we are looking for collaborators in mathematical and practical aspects.
