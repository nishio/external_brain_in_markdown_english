Putting [[ChatGPT]] logs on [[Cosense]] [peace of mind
- I don't feel safe leaving it on ChatGPT.

What is the difference?
- Search from logs
    - It would be nice if the ChatGPT logs could be searched by string or vector.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878668038654099574) Instead of giving you a paper and "telling" you to "summarize" it, I thought I'd give you a "purpose" and I'm not sure what I'm reading the paper for in the first place (...)
>  Joking aside, it's "I'd like to know if there's anything in the paper that's interesting to me" with what I already know and what I'm interested in in memory beforehand.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878668248201470066) And then there's "I don't necessarily need it right now, but there's a good chance I'll need it in the near future, so I want to keep it in a form I can retrieve when I need it" or something like that.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878668417974309003) In order to clarify your purpose to AI, you need to have a clear purpose for your life()

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878670580590973405) Wouldn't it be appropriate to summarize and place it in Cosense to achieve the objective of "storing it in a form that can be retrieved when needed"?

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1878697011383517606) I feel safer putting ChatGPT logs on Cosense, but isn't it crazy to feel safe there in the first place and need to put them in a better system?

I don't feel comfortable just posting it on Twitter/X, so I'll repost it on Cosense.
