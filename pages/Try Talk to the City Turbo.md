- You don't have to have any technical skills to use it! It says.
- I'm stumped because I can't figure out how to scroll with it zoomed in.
- is? Where is the editor's explanation?

- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>Pan (Scroll): Click and drag on the background to move (pan) the display area.
    - No, I'm going to get a box of choice mode.
    - I reloaded and now it works by dragging! Bug?

- Press the Settings button in the upper right corner.

    - The box spread to the outside of the screen!
    - If you drag a node in this state, it will move, but if you drag the background, it will become a range selection.
        - It's a bug.

        - After all, you can't set it up, can you?
    - Zooming out is no longer possible...

- UI that you have to hover to read the description, and even if you hover, you can't read it because it goes off the screen.
- Node Manual
    - [https://talktothecity.org/docs/nodes](https://talktothecity.org/docs/nodes)
        - It's in ABC order, so if you don't know the name, you can't find it...

Pinecore API is requested even if you don't use Pinecore.
- Just put in the appropriate 36 characters.

Some are automatically saved and some are not.
- I wonder if the parameters are automatically saved and the node connections are manually saved.

While I'm editing by zooming in and out of the screen, the UI goes away and I can't press the save button, what?
- I don't have very good eyesight anymore, so I don't want to see tiny letters in the UI or something?


Try using TTTC Turbo.
- No, this is the same name TTTC, but the algorithm is completely different from the TTTC Scatter we are using now.
- I'm plugging data into the LLM, doing the "create topics and subtopics" and then doing the "extract and assign to topics and subtopics" in the extraction phase.
- I don't see a scatter plot, it's not on the Node list.
