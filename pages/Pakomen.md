To be honest, I had underestimated the "famous" nature of their noodles. I was surprised at the quality of the food.

If you think the soup alone is good, they actually serve just the soup as a set with other dishes.

The feeling of sharing and discussing with two people is similar to discussing impressions after watching a movie. I guess this is eating content.

I was amused by the menu and said it looked like Pokemon, but once I ate it, the overwhelming amount of information stopped me from doing so.
