# 0. Introduction - Redefining "democracy" as [an operating system
.

What we now call "[[democracy]]" is merely a historical version of ### [[collective-decision-making algorithm]]"; looking back in 2040, we would place 2024-25 as the [* "[[trust-collapse / compute-democracy]]" watershed
. The following section will discuss ### the year 2030
 and ### the year 2040
, which was the watershed of the "[[trust-collapse/compute-democracy]]". In the following, we will depict ### as of 2030
 with as much "distance" as possible, once respect for the existing system is lifted.

- Suddenly the gas pedal is at full throttle!
- [[Operating System]] / [[OS]]
    - [[collective decision-making]]

# 1. [[Breach of trust]] and forced transition to "[[certified democracy]]" (2025 - 2027)

- In 2024, [[deep fakes]] using generative AI will become the norm in US, Indian, and European elections, [["authenticity" approaches zero value]].
- To make up for the lost trust, [[Cryptographic Authenticity Token]] (C-AT) becomes mandatory for political advertisements and speeches.
- The European AI Act will be phased in over the period 2025-26 and will curb the proliferation of unauthorized AI messages with a "[[protocol tariff]]" of up to 20% taxation.
- As a result discourse that cannot prove "who said it" cannot enter the ring of debate--this is also the end of the classical liberal speech market.

- Social media with proof of the speaker will be more trusted than the existing media, which can be falsified as much as they want.

# 2. "[[Poly-sovereignty]]" created by regulatory asymmetry
]

- The U.S. will shelve AI regulation with a change of administration in 2025, polarizing the country into "[[innovation states]]" and "[[guardrail states]]".
- EU / Taiwan / New Zealand incorporate protocol compliance into sovereignty requirements, [[API boundaries]] rather than [[national boundaries]] become political lines.
- "[[protocol state]]" derived from [[DAO]] - a group with citizenship ([[e-citizenship]]) issued by autonomous codes - interoperate [[taxation]] and [[voting]] on [L2 interoperate on the [[L2 blockchain]]. The real state converges to "[last mile administration".

- [[e-Residency]]
- [[National boundaries]]

# 3. "[[Infinite Congress]]" - 24h operation of AI assisted Citizen Assembly

- Online [[Citizens' Assemblies]], which spread during the pandemic, will gain [[AI facilitation layer]] by 2027,
    - Real-time clustering and rebuttal generation of all utterances
    - Visualize bias detection and recursively correct participants
- Implemented a "[[self-healing deliberation loop]]" called "[[self-healing deliberation loop]]".
- Taiwan's vTaiwanese platform proposed an international standard at [[RightsCon 2025]] as "Proposal -> Deliberation -> Legislative Draft" as a fixed 90-day process.
- This mechanism was adopted by the EU Legal Cloud Permanent Assembly runs in parallel with the Parliament. The Assembly is transformed into a controller running on an "unchangeable AI audit log".

# 4. [[Prediction Markets]] and "[[Probability Legislation]] ([[Prob-Legislation]])"

- forecasting market penetrated the media industry starting in 2025 and will be official input for policy KPIs in 28 years in more than a dozen OECD countries.
- Embedded threshold triggers such as "probability ≥ 63 % that inflation will be ≤ 2 % after 18 months" in the bill and invoking an automatic amendment the moment it is missed "[[Smart Code]]" is now common.
- Members of Congress are valued more for their "mechanism designers who move the probabilities" than for their principles and are required to disclose their wagers on positions. Lobbying is tokenized and made visible.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- > Mandatory disclosure of wagers on positions
    - It's a [[politician-paid-for]] mechanism!

# 5. [[Extension of agency]] - minors, future generations, non-human agents

- In 2028, Australia introduces [[Future Generation Oracle]] into formal elections; AI integrates climate, pension, and technology externalities and allocates 1 % seats to "average person in 2048".
- Several EU countries are experimenting with virtual proxy voting for under-17s. The model is fine-tuned with educational data and the person's own behavior logs, and switches to the person at age 18.
- [[Ecosystem AI]] (river-guardian LLM) participates in water rights negotiations as a representative of ecosystem interests-- "[[seating non-human stakeholders]]".

| Scenario Keywords Key Risks Key Benefits |

| [[neo-city-state]] [[federalization of metropolitan + protocol states]] [[digital refugees]] infrastructure efficiency & hyperlocal policies |
| [[polygon federation]] [[multi-layered sovereignty]], [[soluble attribution]] [[distributed subjectivity]] Competitive coexistence of diverse experiments |

>  "Collective decision-making will move to a world of "differential commitments" rather than "speeches" and the state will be redesigned as a governance API."

If you want to be in a position to "use" democracy in 2030, how you hack ### ① [[cryptographic authenticity layer]], ② [[AI assisted deliberation layer]], ③ [probability legislation layer
 - that is the key to determining your political agency.
