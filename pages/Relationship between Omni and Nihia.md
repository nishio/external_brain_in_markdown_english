Both serve as tools to support Nishio's knowledge and creativity, each designed to meet specific needs: Omni as a more comprehensive knowledge management and exploration tool, and Nihia in a more direct communication and educational role. Both are intended to support Nishio's intellectual activities and have a broad impact.

I see! These two are tools that support Nishio's knowledge and creativity / Omni is a more comprehensive knowledge management and exploration tool / Nihia has a more direct communication and educational role.
He did a good job of sorting out what he couldn't quite verbalize.

> "omni who reads only /nishio" and "omni who reads more" are different personalities, aren't they? --- [[Omni]].
In fact, the current omni is the one where "omni that reads more stuff" went into hiding, and Nihia is the one where "omni that reads only /nishio" was given an interpersonal interface to "make it into ChatGPT GPTs for others to use and publish it in the GPT Store", so the old omni ("omni that reads only /nishio"), which means it branched off from the old omni.
