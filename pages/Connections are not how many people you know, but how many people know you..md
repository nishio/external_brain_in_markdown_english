- [[personal connections]] is not how many people you know, but how many people [[you are known by]].

Although this phrase expresses a general idea that is quoted in many speeches and books on business and human relations, I could find no record of it as a quote attributed to a specific person. Therefore, it may be difficult to identify the person who first uttered the phrase.

It should have been there a long time ago.

The phrase itself is based on the standard business and self-help adage "It's not who you know; it's who knows you." in the English-speaking world, and it is difficult to pinpoint a definite "first appearance" of the phrase. Similar phrases can be found in marketing and networking books since at least the 1970s and 1980s, indicating that the idea that "networking = the number of people who know you and your influence" was already widespread at that time.

In the Japanese-speaking world, it is thought to have become widely known through translation and quotation in business and self-help books, but there is no established theory as to "who first started saying it. In short, the phrase has been continually restated and reinterpreted on many occasions, and it is virtually impossible to pinpoint a definite first occurrence.

- I realized that the Japanese phrase "Human network is not how many people you know, but how many people know you" is a "quantity" concept, like "It's good to be known by many people", but the English phrase "It's not who you know; it's who knows you. It's not who you know; it's who knows you.
- Attention from a few strong people" in "[Not by name recognition.
    - Preserving that nuance, I'd translate that to "[[networking is not which people you know, but which people you are known by]]."
    - But I'd rather phrase this realization in a new way, "[[A]] network is not how many people know you, but which people know you."


- [[SOC]]
- [[degree of familiarity]]
