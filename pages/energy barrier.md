- [[Drill a hole in the levee]]
- [[Even if it makes a hole in the levee.]]
- [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]
- [[Activation Barrier]]
    - [[energy barrier]] in [[activation energy]]
- [[Reaction Barrier]]
- [[catalyst]]

> [[Activation energy]] can be thought of as the magnitude of the [[potential barrier]] (sometimes called the [[energy barrier]]) separating minima of the potential energy surface pertaining to the initial and final thermodynamic state.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I have a concept that is pointed to by several words like [[Activation Barrier]] and [[Reaction Barrier]] and [[catalyst]] and [[dike metaphor]], and I'd like to suggest some good words to call this concept.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt-4/icon' alt='gpt-4.icon' height="19.5"/>I suggest a few good words to describe this concept:
    - [[energy barrier]]
- [[reaction rate control]]
- [[Catalytic effect]]
- [[Transition state adjustment]]
- [[Reaction acceleration]]
These terms encompass concepts such as activation barriers, reaction barriers, catalysts, and the dike metaphor, and are suitable for describing chemical reactions and physical phenomena that take into account reaction rates and energy changes. The choices are appropriate for the situation and context.
