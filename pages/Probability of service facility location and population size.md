> [nikiuo11](https://twitter.com/nikiuo11/status/1757035154563080332/photo/1) FF gave me this information the other day.
>  Shared because it was very clear what will happen if the birthrate declines and the population ages.
>  With a population of less than 100,000, there will be no more movie theaters and it will be difficult to manage nursing homes.
>  Less than 20,000 people will lose department stores, supermarkets, karaoke and fast food restaurants.
>  Less than 10,000 people will lose their hospitals and real estate agencies.
>  It seems that things like this, which were taken for granted, will disappear as the population decreases.
>  The chart below is from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, showing services and municipality size (population).
>  The one that says this will be lost if the population is not this high. I was wondering if you would like to see one for rural areas in particular.
>  It's moderately interesting.
