<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to talk about being able to put it on the home screen.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "home screen" is that "home screen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The screen where application icons are lined up. Keicho can now be lined up there as well.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keicho" is this "Keicho"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>About this chat. The conventional method of tracing a bookmark required the user to "open the browser first" (where extra content would be visible), "bring up the bookmark list" (to find Keicho from the list written in text), and "select" it. This is no longer necessary.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Keicho"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's something I use when I want to organize my mind, so I don't want to distract myself with unnecessary information or do unnecessary work when I want to use it.

- >  This chat. With the previous method of following a bookmark, you had to "open the browser first" (where you would see extra content), "bring up the bookmark list" (to find Keicho from the list written in text), and "select". This is no longer necessary.
- Where is this "Keicho" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I used to describe it as "it's in your phone and you can use it anywhere," but now I've added to that "it's on your home screen and you can call it up with one touch.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "home screen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The first screen is even easier to access.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "screen" is that "screen"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The application icons are lined up, and with Keicho, the robot icon is displayed. The displayed icon was also changed from the React default icon until recently.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "Keicho"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is placed on the home screen with a distinctive icon so it can be easily found.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is something that can be called up quickly and without extra effort or irritation.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "hassle" is that "hassle"?
