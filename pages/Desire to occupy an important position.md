title: "Desire to occupy an important position"
---

I didn't understand what others were talking to me about, and I wondered why. I wondered.
I thought it was because they were assuming that I had a "desire to occupy an important [[position]]".

Specifically, why don't we create a Japan branch-like legal entity of a certain movement and funnel the cash generated by another case into it? Something like that.
I never understood why it was necessary to do that, but it seems to me that if you do that, you have a source of income for the legal entity, and therefore, you have spontaneous authority.
No, I thought, that's just a pain in the ass.

But then I don't think you can say that there is no "desire to occupy an important position."
I guess it depends on what you consider important.
I'll be chatting with smart people to discuss the realization of a common ideal, and in the course of that discussion, something like this will come up, and I'll be like, "I see...
This is what I consider a "key position."

[[It's stimulating to talk to people from different cultures]].
