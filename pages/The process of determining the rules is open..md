How to create a good [[teamwork]] (Conversation between President Aono of Cybozu and Representative Aoki of Classicom) - Scandinavian Living Tool Store
[https://hokuohkurashi.com/note/94558](https://hokuohkurashi.com/note/94558)
> Before doing teamwork, let's talk together and "make rules".
>  It is also effective to make the process of decision making as open as possible so that it does not become something that is advantageous to someone and someone cries behind their back. At Cybozu, when creating a new system, discussions are made public on an Internet bulletin board that all employees can see.
>  When you hear "many rules," you may feel that you are not free, but in fact, rules are what support diversity.
>  If you follow through with this and tell those around you what you want and what kind of person you are, perhaps it will be easier to gain their understanding. Also, if a situation persists where rules are not being followed, it is probably a good time to rethink that approach.
