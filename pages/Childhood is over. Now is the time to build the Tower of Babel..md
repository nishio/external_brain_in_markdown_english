- [To 2017: "Childhood is over. Now is the Time to Build the Tower of Babel" (Part I) | FUZE](https://t.co/KqW9ryQAT7)
        - [[Yoichi Ochiai]]
        - [[End of childhood]]
        - [[Tower of Babel]]

- A major shift from "Sharing experiences with the group" to "Personal Capacity Expansion.
- [[optimistic singularity]]" and "[[technophobia]]
    - In the future, everything in reality will be manipulated without distinction between matter and substance. I call it [[digital nature]] rather than [[mixed reality]].
- It wasn't a machine that beat Lee Sedol in Go, but an engineering expert with high [[computer affinity]], not a Go expert.
    - What was the value of the vague prospect of joblessness in 2040? Much of it resembled the [[eschatology]] of the last century.
    - Where in this world is there a local that can live on basic income? It is in blue America. There would be no other place in the world where people could live by doing what only human beings can do - spending their leisure time doing creative activities - and where enough wealth would be gathered to make that possible.
    - The only way is to work well so as not to be eliminated as a cost by increasing affinity with machines, or to take jobs away from other humans after mastering the machines. This is not a battle between machines and humans, but between "humans" and "humans with high affinity for machines.
- Protopia" brought about by the fluidity of technology
        - [[Kevin Kelly.]]
        - [[Protopia]] is a worldview that gradually improves through repeated [[liquidity]] of [[technological innovation]], and is a form of [[decent dystopia]] that is self-organized and non-uniform. In other words, it is a kind of "Optimistic Technology Thinking.
        - More than any possible dystopia or protopia, its greatest barrier is [[technophobia]] itself... The power of [[technophobia]], which hates systemic change, rather than a closed system, is more frightening. Power that prevents democratization creates more distorted disparities.
    - [[The Magic Century]]
        - The 20th century, when [[mass media]]-type information transmission systems dominated the world, was called "[[The Century of Images]],
    - As a contrast, he called this century the "magic century" in which everything is "[[black-boxing]] = [[bewitching]]" by computers.
        - The book is likened to the American social critic [[Morris Berman]]'s "[[Re-magic of the world]]," in which he describes the "magic of the world" as a "magic of the world.
        - [VR for the poor = "the kind of reality I wish I had.
        - Oxford University Press has chosen "[[Post-Truth]]" as the word of the year.
            - It means that objective facts and truth are not considered important in political choices.
            - Here I had a sense of glimpse of 21st century humanity.
- Is truth justice? And is fiction evil?
    - With multiple communities and [[values]], does it make sense to create a unified sentiment and rules and games?
        - Instead of talking in terms of "shoulds" for rules, it would be better to consider the economic and emotional synergies.
        - We can no longer seek one trend or value.
        - Majority rule is a means of bringing about a reality that is slightly at odds with each community.
- The changes that are taking place now, the age of opinion rather than truth, can be summed up in one word: "the adaptation of mankind.
    - If we try to estimate the human race afterwards by our habits, norms, and ideas before they were changed by technology, it will cause friction with technology. The change that is taking place now, the age of opinion rather than truth, can be summed up in one word: human adaptation.
