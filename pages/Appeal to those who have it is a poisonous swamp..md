[[Appeal to those who have]] is [[poisonous swamp]].
Half of this is something I talked about in private when I was younger, but I decided to write it down because it has developed in connection with something else at this time and I don't feel the need to keep it private anymore.
- When a man with money behaves [[appeal (to)]] that he has money, women will come to him for money #Rich Appeal
    - This is seemingly "[[popular]]", some people make this choice to show off that they are "[[popular]]" in the [[mounting]] competition among men #motivational appeal
    - However, if you think about it a little, you can recognize that the person doing it is also coming to you for the money.
    - A little more thought leads to the perception that "people around me perceive it that way.
    - This is the [[pool of venom]], which does continuous [[damage]] to the [mental
    - Information can't be retracted, so once you start appealing, you can't quit even if your heart starts to hurt.
    - So, until you meet someone who you think "is not coming to you for money," you should refrain from such appeals.
    - You only need one of these partners, [[you don't need to be popular with a lot of people]].
    - Just having one such partner increases [[self-assurance]] and leads to [[mental stability]].
- The reason I suddenly remembered this is because I realized that "[[authority]]" is the same for middle-aged men.
    - In other words, if you pretend to have power, people who want to enjoy the benefits of that power will gather around you.
    - This way you look [[popular]].
    - But in the end, the same composition as above causes mental damage due to [[solitude]].
            - [[mid-crisis]]
    - Speaking for myself, I'm not pretending that I have power and I don't, but I really don't. lol
        - It's nice to be appreciated by people who should know that, because it makes me feel like [[I'm being appreciated on the inside]].

[[Blessed are the have-nots.]]
- [["He who has it is unhappy.]]
- [[Blessed are the poor]] ([[Luke]] 6.20)
appeal (to)
    - [[desire for approval]]
    - This is the first thing to begin with [[poison]].
