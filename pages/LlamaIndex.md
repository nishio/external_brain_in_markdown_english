Miscellaneous Commentary:.
- GPT3 by including data not used in the study as reference material in the prompts.
    - Up-to-date information that did not exist at the time of the study
    - Data that cannot be made accessible on the Internet for copyright reasons, such as e-books
    - Items that cannot be disclosed outside the company, such as customer contact history data in groupware
- ã€œMechanism that allows GPT3 to use ~, etc.
- Typical usage:.
    - Create [[embedded vector]] from a document at hand with OpenAI API
    - For a query sentence, use [[vector search]] to find related documents.
    - Embed that document in the prompt to GPT3
