Majority rule, especially in a "winner-takes-all" system, tends to create a sense of "the losing side is unrepresented" because of its zero-sum structure that shuts out minorities from the legislature, emphasizes the boundaries of political parties and groups, and encourages "battles for existence" - thereby deepening social and political divisions. " - and as a result, studies have accumulated showing that it tends to deepen social and political divisions.

How majority rule creates division

[[Zero-sum structure]] and [[winner-take-all]]
It has been pointed out that in a single-seat, simple-majority system, a slight increase in the number of votes can lead to a monopoly of seats, making elections a game of "all-or-nothing". ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_system?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[Economics for Inclusive Prosperity https:// econfip.org/policy-briefs/majoritarian-versus-proportional-representation-voting/?utm_source=chatgpt.com]]). rationalizes electoral tactics that fuel conflict. ([Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/))

Tyranny of the Majority" and Exclusion of Minorities
As early as the 19th century, Tocqueville warned of the "tyranny of the majority" ([[NEH-Edsitement ]]). ([NEH-Edsitement](https://edsitement.neh.gov/curricula/alexis-de-tocqueville-tyranny-majority?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Today's research also argues that majority rule and democracy are incompatible in deeply divided Today's research also argues that majority rule and democracy are incompatible in deeply divided, multi-ethnic societies. ([Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02589347708704717?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Springer Link [https://link](https://link) .springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-04314-9_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com])

Two-party fixation and ideological radicalization
It has been analyzed that a simple majority system is likely to make third parties "dead votes" and strengthen the two-party system - resulting in a convergence of public consciousness to an "us vs. them" bipolar composition, where compromise is seen as a betrayal. ([Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/), [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace https:// carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says? lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com]])

Incentives for misinformation and negative campaigning
In an environment where candidates only need to aim for a majority, there is some evidence that spreading misinformation that reduces support for the opposing camp becomes a rational strategy and increases fake news.

Empirical Evidence

Comparative Political Science Findings
- Consensus type vs. majority type
- Recent studies comparing 27 countries report that consensus democracies (proportional representation and coalition-centered) are more resistant to identity fragmentation. ([Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2022.2117300?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Failures and Alternatives in a Severely Divided Society
- Lijphart stated that "in countries with deep social cleavages, majority rule is likely to be dysfunctional and power-sharing (consociationalism) is realistic." ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-04314-9_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Case Studies in the U.S.
- Pernicious polarization
- It has been pointed out that the simple majority/primary election system in the United States has perpetuated "mutual distrust between the two camps" and has reached the highest level of division in the developed world. ([Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/))
- The Simple Majority Argument for Legislative Procedure
- Both conservatives and liberals warn that abolishing the filibuster and enforcing the "simple majority rule" could exacerbate divisions. ([TIME](https://time.com/5949042/preserve-the-filibuster-better-ways-to-reform/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Political Observations
- The ideological distance in Congress has more than doubled since before the spread of television, and total winner-take-all is reportedly a factor preventing consensus building. ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/02/long-division?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Japanese document
- Tetsuki Tamura argued that a divided society requires a deliberative system-type multi-linear institutional design. ([J-Stage](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/hikakuseiji/20/0/20_1/_pdf/-char/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- The Association for the Promotion of Bright Elections report also states, "Lack of transparency and representation leads to a decline in trust and division." ([Association for the Promotion of Bright Elections](https://www.akaruisenkyo.or.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Voters69.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Alternative systems to be discussed as mitigation measures

Proportional representation and multi-seat districts
It is proposed that reducing the discrepancy between votes and seats and expanding the "space for voices to be heard" could weaken the zero-sum winner-takes-all mentality and ease division. ([Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Ranked Voting (RCV)
The method of ranking candidates with close preferences reduces the effectiveness of negative campaigning and increasingly demonstrates polarization control as the winner is more likely to gain broad support. ([FairVote](https://fairvote.org/report/ranked-choice-voting-lowers-polarization-in-politics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Effective Government](https://effectivegov.uchicago.edu/primers/ranked-choice-voting?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Power sharing and deliberative system
Designs that "layer participation," such as committee-style coalitions, resident councils, and deliberative public opinion polls, have been praised for their ability to complement the exclusivity of majority rule. ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/peace-boundaries?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Summary and points to note
- Although majority rule itself is not the sole cause of division, it is a common conclusion of comparative studies and empirical analyses that winner-take-all schemes are a powerful "fuel" for rationalizing polarization. ([Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/), [[Taylor & Francis Online https:// www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2022.2117300?utm_source=chatgpt.com]])
- Institutional changes (proportional representation and RCV) are promising, but some are cautious that they will only be effective in conjunction with complex reforms such as media environment, fiscal disparity, and social media design.
