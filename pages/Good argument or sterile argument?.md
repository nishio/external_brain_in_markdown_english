title: "Good argument or sterile argument?"
---

A case where some people think "[[discussion]] should be like this" and others think "[fruitless (resultless) debate".
- I'm thinking [[barren]].

> [rockwell8537](https://twitter.com/rockwell8537/status/1687496081784139776) me "I wish I could take the kids when I get divorced."

>  Quote woman: "The truancy and delinquency rate for fatherless families is four times higher than for two-parent families and twice as high as for motherless families, it's a friggin' hard mode."
>
>  I said, "I checked and the truancy rate of fatherless families is half that of motherless families. Don't be a prude."
>
>  Quote woman: "I made a mistake because I wrote it just right. Putting aside truancy, the delinquency rate is bad."

> [rockwell8537](https://twitter.com/rockwell8537/status/1687497353589358592) me "Source it!"
>
>  Quote woman "(put up the URL of the website)"
>
>  Me (Oh man, I've really found a source for the high delinquency rate of fatherless families. Anyway, I guess I'll just look up paternity and delinquency rates and see if I can find any disproof.)
>
>  I (well, there is no disproof... she put up an article-based media, but there must be a source article for this kind of article)

> [rockwell8537](https://twitter.com/rockwell8537/status/1687498001420627968) me (ok, let's find the paper that that article was based on...)
>
>  Me (Oh, there it is. Looks like fatherless families really do have a high delinquency rate. Let's just leave the data for now and see what you think...)
>
>  Consideration: "In modern Japan, the cases in which the father can obtain custody include those in which the mother relinquished custody because of the child's disability, and those in which the mother's life is seriously ruined and the court determines that she cannot provide for the child.

>  Me (Okay, here it is.)

> [rockwell8537](https://twitter.com/rockwell8537/status/1687499799887851520) To begin with, the delinquency rate for fatherless families is 1/25th of that of two-parent families, even though it is four times higher,

>  ・There is no way I'm in the bottom 25th percentile.
>  It doesn't matter if the child is delinquent (criminal penalty), as long as he/she is alive.

>  I had the feeling that I was going to be able to beat them with my values, but when I told them that, it would be a difference in values, so I did my best to find out what they thought of my values.

> [rockwell8537](https://twitter.com/rockwell8537/status/1687631502224539652) By the way, I'm single, have no kids and have never been married in the past(?).

> [Curekabuto](https://twitter.com/Curekabuto/status/1687667927141797889) The other guy was neat too.

> [bImInu4alSruxMy](https://twitter.com/bImInu4alSruxMy/status/1687648272649998337) I'm arguing straighter than most community note eaters.

> [KTA80441690](https://twitter.com/KTA80441690/status/1687594969996111877) Well, discussions usually go so far.

> [3P2zl9nPqUwBFON](https://twitter.com/3P2zl9nPqUwBFON/status/1687628383541440514) very sterile discussion

> [much0107](https://twitter.com/much0107/status/1687694770158850049) I grew up in a father-son household. As a kid I thought it was the worst growing up under a father even though I'm a woman, but now as an adult I haven't seen my mother in over 20 years and considering her personality, etc., I think it probably would have been an even worse environment if it had been a mother and son family.
>  Depending on the character of the mother or father, I hope the child will grow up in a better environment for him or her!

> [nabenabe02180](https://twitter.com/nabenabe02180/status/1687697229447081985) correct discussion with X's quote opinionator rare lol

> [sawayou_dtman](https://twitter.com/sawayou_dtman/status/1687677793587630080) Well, the fact that you've properly sourced your information is by far a better argument opponent than the rest.
>
>  I'll just say that we're far different from a group of people who are upset about a label that they feel good about.

> [hydelander315](https://twitter.com/hydelander315/status/1687662873429065728) That's a discussion, gently.
>  complete victory when no reply is returned.

> [denryoku_kita](https://twitter.com/denryoku_kita/status/1687657692498911232) I respect you so much for your logical thinking!

> [olitan2019](https://twitter.com/olitan2019/status/1687667377914425344) You're lucky to have someone you can talk to.

> [8_yukitpok](https://twitter.com/8_yukitpok/status/1687704239408353280) In the end, it's not about whether or not you want your kids to worry about money.

> [scsbizyi](https://twitter.com/scsbizyi/status/1687655900423880704) I hope this enlightenment makes the quoted woman reflect, but the next day she'll be resubmitting the same thing = no point in arguing.
