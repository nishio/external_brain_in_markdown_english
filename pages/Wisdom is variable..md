Excessive stress," "lack of sleep," "trouble," or "disaster" will greatly reduce your judgment and narrow your vision. Just thinking, "I'm getting dumber now," will change your behavior and increase your chances of survival.

Recognizing that "one's smarts fluctuate" aids in survival. Stress, lack of sleep, and other factors can reduce one's judgment and narrow one's perspective. Too high self-esteem can lead to major mistakes. It is also important to understand and develop one's own qualities. One's life is one's own responsibility and one should aim for self-realization. Fatigue and stress can make you more alert and aggressive. When one's mind is tired, one's vision tends to narrow and one tends to use large subjects. Greatness is temporary, and continuing to think of oneself as great makes life difficult. Creativity is enhanced by overcoming sloppiness. If you are the cause of your own confusion, you can change it. Condescension is hubris and can affect others.
