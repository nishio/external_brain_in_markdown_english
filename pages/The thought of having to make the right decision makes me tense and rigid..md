title: "The thought of having to make the right decision makes me tense and rigid."

If you are aware that you have made a decision, you can correct the course when you realize that you made a mistake. If you don't make decisions and just go with the flow, you will always go with the flow.

If you think that you have to swim through the situation, correcting your decision-making little by little, you will feel more relaxed. This kind of metaphor is important.
