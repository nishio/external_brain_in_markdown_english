- The operation "[[majority rule]]" does not satisfy [[associative law]].
- Therefore, the result depends on the order in which the operations are performed.
    - The [[non-linearity]] makes the total amount of "A6B9" and "B" larger, but applying the "majority rule" operation to the combination "A2B1" to make it "A" yields a gain of 2 points compared to doing the same operation to "B3" to make it "B".
