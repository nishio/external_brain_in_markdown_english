### Digest

Project success depends on the balance between members' interests and market value; personalization of information is valuable; new teamwork can be created if AI can match interests and situational matches with involvement in the project. Role sharing and the ability of leaders to complement themselves is important, and a new approach is needed to take advantage of uncertainty and profit from it. Emphasize perspectives from AI and other life forms as well as humans. Combination of exploratory net and KJ method is effective for problem solving, converting information from a broad perspective into a form that can be processed by humans; to apply the similarities between GTD and KJ method to other productivity methods, the relationship between tacit knowledge and discomfort is important, and tacit knowledge is shared between humans and AIs.

### New Ideas

The discussion of "[[food for the intellect]]" is relevant to the personalization of information. The outlay for cultivating intellect depends on individual interests and values. This is consistent with the importance of matching project involvement to one's own interests and circumstances. The consideration of "[[family resemblance]]" is also important from the perspective of teamwork and role sharing. The idea that members who do not share common characteristics can form a group by sharing partial common characteristics can be applied to the formation of project teams.

'Thinking deeply about the nourishment of intelligence and how it affects individual interests and values?' And how can the idea of family resemblance be applied to the formation of project teams?" The question arose.
