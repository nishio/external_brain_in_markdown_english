title: "Why hasn't a consistent system of knowledge description method been invented?"
---

- [[Software is a consistent body of knowledge]] continued

I wondered why a consistent method of describing knowledge systems has not been invented.

This question is wrong, and an artificial language called [[programming language]] was created and is actually used to describe [[for computer reading]].
So the "consistent knowledge system description method" has already been invented, and it is not a natural language.

- [[natural language]], or a human-readable form, or something closer to it?
- Natural language is probably an inappropriate language.
    - There are [[mathematical terms]] and [[legal (law) terms]] in languages that use natural language and are committed to consistency, but in the end neither is readable by the general public
        - Because they don't want to pay the training costs to read.
        - Most Homo sapiens don't want "consistency in their knowledge system" so they don't get paid for the effort they put into making it.

- [[Natural language implementation]]
- Programming for systems that are a combination of human and computer is required.
