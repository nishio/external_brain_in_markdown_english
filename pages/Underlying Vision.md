The [[underlying]] [[vision]] and the [[project]] that [[externally]] [[exposures]] and [[observable]] are [[Not equal.]]

- A: I do a project because it helps me move in the direction of my vision.
- B: There is going to be long term value from what I get from moving in the direction of a certain vision, but I don't want to stay there, I want to move on, so I build a place for people who want to get value.
- C: I participate in a project because it is beneficial in the short term to move in the direction of my vision
    - Instead of being less efficient than A, it is often [[faster than doing it alone]] because there is synergy with other participants and resources already created compared to creating a project from scratch.
    - On the other hand, our visions are not aligned, so we're sure to leave in the long run.
        - There is no such thing as "[[vision matches]]," so it "[[aligns]]."

- [[Social Hack Day #64]] said, "You used to have a book club.
    - Sure, there are people who work on the same project for years on end, and there are people like me who change it frequently.
    - I don't feel the need to do the same content at the next Social Hack Day because I believe that projects are meant to be completed and the time of completion is the end of the day.
    - A sense of recognizing the [[civic tech]] community as a [[community as a bundle of projects]] and that [[projects are]] fuel for progress, and since they are [[fuel]], they deserve to burn up and disappear.
