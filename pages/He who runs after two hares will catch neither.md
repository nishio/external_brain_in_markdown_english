## digest of notes
.
This section discusses situations in which "one who pursues two hares will catch neither hare" and situations in which "two birds with one stone," "two birds with one stroke," and "a move in the ear-red" are possible.

## Relation to Fragment
.
The "[[double-goal]]" fragment is directly related to the theme of the note. The note asks about the situation of achieving multiple goals with a single action ("two birds with one stone," "one move," or "one ear-red move") and losing other goals by focusing on one ("he who pursues two hares will gain none"). Fragment defines "double goals" as pursuing more than one goal at a time, and discusses its efficiency and limitations. This corresponds directly to the question in the note.

## deep thinking
Words such as "he who runs after two hares will catch neither" and "two birds with one stone" indicate that a single action can have multiple outcomes. However, these outcomes cannot always be achieved simultaneously; it depends on the time and circumstances. Therefore, it can be said that the choice of goal and the direction of action depend on the interrelationship between the situation and the goal.

## summary of thoughts
The direction of goal attainment is determined by the interrelationship between the situation and the goal.

## Title
.
"Direction of goal attainment: interrelationships between situations and goals."
