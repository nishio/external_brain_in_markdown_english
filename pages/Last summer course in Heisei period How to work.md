Theme: Discussion about rediscovering "how to work" from diverse perspectives, including people with disabilities, local communities, and government, and creating new values.

Background issues:.
- The traditional stereotype of "work = to earn money" makes it difficult to take advantage of diverse environments and personalities, such as people with disabilities and rural areas.
- Government has fixed rules and procedures, making it difficult to design a flexible and agile system.
- Rural and mountainous areas tend to lack jobs and people, but in fact, what they do not have can actually be a strength.

New perspectives/keywords:.
- Learning from disability: Shift from "cure" to "designing a way of life" and work in a way that values one's own personality.
- Learning from Children: Children are less likely to be stereotyped. Adults can co-create new ways of working by being willing to learn.
- Technology: AI, RPA, online work, robots, etc. can expand the possibilities of "work" beyond location and physical limitations.
- Education and mechanism building: There are few opportunities to learn "the meaning of work" in schools. Government systems and communities also need flexible ways of appointing and involving human resources.

Social vision: The
- The "handicaps" such as disabilities and regional areas are rather an advantage.
- We have a system (system and technology) that can respond to diverse personalities and environments, and is not limited by location or conditions.
- Everyone works as they are, and the people around them accept this as "normal.

To put it briefly, the group agreed that "there are hints for new ways of working in what have been conventionally regarded as "issues," such as disabilities and regional disparities. We agreed to create a society where diversity can be taken for granted by leveraging the power of technology and updating education and administrative systems.
