I don't think the digital tools are trickling down.
    - It's been about six months since we talked about [Digital tools trickle down.
    - In the meantime, I wonder if trickle-down has progressed... I feel like in the end [[there's a divide between those who use AI and those who don't]].
- It's not a trickle down or not, it's more like "yes, but it doesn't reach the end of the line".

    - Like, "It's not an A, but it's not a C either, it's a B."
    - You could argue that "B is because it is the process that leads to C."
        - Not sure when it will be C.
