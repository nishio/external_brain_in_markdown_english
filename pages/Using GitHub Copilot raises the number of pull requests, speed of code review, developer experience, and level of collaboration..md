# summary and discussion
.

1.### Individual efficiency contributes to team strength
.
- Copilot increases developer productivity by reducing search time and simple tasks, as well as improving code quality. As a result, pull requests and reviews are turned around faster, allowing individuals to complete tasks more quickly. This reduces the number of situations that require consultation and dependence on the entire team, allowing resources to be redirected to high-level discussions and collaborative work.

2.### Introduction into the organization promotes teamwork
.
- As pointed out in the article, veterans tend to be more reluctant to adopt new tools, and leaving it up to the individual may not promote their widespread use. The key to increasing acceptance of new tools and a sense of team collaboration is for the organization to take the initiative in sharing the purpose and usage of the tools. If everyone works from the same foundation, information sharing and collaboration will proceed smoothly.

3.### Ripple effects as "individual -> team -> organization"
.
- Increased individual efficiency with Copilot results in better team flow, which in turn boosts the level of collaboration in the organization. In particular, novice or short-tenured developers will have fewer opportunities to interrupt others with questions, and will be less likely to disrupt the team's focus. This improvement in "independent execution" will ultimately lead to "more creative collaboration.

4.### A culture of continuous learning is essential
.
- Copilot automatically generates code, but blind trust in it risks low maintainability and black-boxing. In order to continue to safely produce results, it is a prerequisite that developers understand and verify the code. This healthy attitude, continued learning, and fostering a culture of "fully utilizing" the tool is the foundation of teamwork.

# Conclusion
.
The article suggests that generative AI such as Copilot can not only increase work efficiency and code quality simultaneously, but also raise the level of team collaboration. However, to make the new tools take root, teams need to work together to support learning by the organization and knowledge sharing among team members. Establishing these measures will be a major step toward creating a "society overflowing with teamwork," in which individuals shine and complement each other.
