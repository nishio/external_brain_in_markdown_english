title: "How to conduct a weekly meeting"
---

- We have been having weekly meetings according to the following templates.
    - Previous Scheduled Links
        - Hours.
        - what to do
    - How much time you have spent from the previous meeting to now
    - What has been done from the previous meeting to now?
    - What are you having trouble with now?
    - When is the next meeting?
    - How much time you plan to spend before the next meeting
    - What is planned to be done before the next meeting

- 2019 "Isn't this too administrative?" I'm starting to get the feeling that
- Hard "what do you plan to have done by the next meeting?"
- Depends on the personality of the person you're dealing with.
    - Type 1
        - I'll do A."
        - →I'll give it a shot and see if B looks good.
        - →I'll do a B.
        - →We were going to do A, but we did B!"
            - I have no problem at all with this type of thing.
    - Type 2
        - I'll do A."
        - →I'll give it a shot and see if B looks good.
        - →But I told the teacher I was going to do A."
        - → Do A while thinking B looks better.
        - →I did A, but I think B is better."
            - This is not good.
- The idea that "[[plans]] can be changed" is not a consensus in the first place.
    - We need to make a clear consensus.

- [[Goals may be modified.]]
