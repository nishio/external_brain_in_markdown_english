title: "Fast and Slow Worlds"
---

- The mention of [[Multiparty conversation]] triggered the development of the concept of [[fast world]] and [[slow world]].
- People who are used to the fast world feel "slow" when they come to the slow world.
    - There are cases where we try to speed up a slow world and other cases where we swing attention according to speed.
- People who are used to a low-speed world find it painful when they come to a high-speed world.
    - I use my brain more than I normally use it.

[[fast world]].
[[slow world]].
