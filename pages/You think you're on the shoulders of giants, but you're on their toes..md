title: "You think you're on the shoulders of giants, but you're on their toes."

It's certainly better than being on [[the Titan]] and not being on it, but it's [[the toe]] there, not [[the shoulder]].

Climbing to the shoulders is hard, climbing to the toes is easy.
- Many people are satisfied with that because they just climb on their toes and "get high".
- Climbing to the top of my feet, "I went even higher!"
- You have to climb up to the shoulders to get [[a giant's view]].

- [[Riding on the shoulders of giants]]
[[Visibility]]
