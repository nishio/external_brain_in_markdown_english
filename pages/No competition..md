- > "We have no competitors."
- > In many cases, the customer's issues are not understood, or there is a lack of research on the industry.
- > If the customer has a challenge, they would have solved it by other means. The term "no competition" itself should be used with caution, since it means [[if there really is no competition, then it is not an issue worth solving]].

Whose issues are you trying to solve and what issues are you trying to solve with what you are trying to create?
- It doesn't matter who the "who" is, it can be "me."
    - It's a lot better than nothing.
            - [[Work for yourself first.]]
            - [[Make something that meets your needs first.]]
    - I think [[unexplored junior]] is not an entrepreneurship school and doesn't need "assignments".
    - I'll make it because I want to make it!" But that's okay.
    - However, if you want to continue in your future life, you need other financial resources to maintain your lifestyle.
- When solving "issues" for "others," ask yourself, "How is that person solving the issue right now?" Think about
    - If it's resolved, there's a competitor.
    - If it's not resolved, then that person isn't in much trouble if it's not resolved.

- However, it's possible that people don't really think "it's technically solvable" when it comes to something new and possible, and if that's the case, it's also possible that there is no competition to solve it at this point in time.
    - I'm starting to think this is [[chasm]] after all.
    - The "people who are enthusiastic when shown that they can do something they thought they couldn't do (the minority)" and the "people who decide whether or not to hire someone based on whether or not they are useful to them (the majority)."
    - [I guess the latter is the case, but I wonder if this can be designed in advance.
        - I don't know
        - Maybe I just don't know because I've never created a service that would be popular with the masses.
    - There are those who say, "If you asked the customer what he wanted, he would have said he wanted [[a fast horse]]," and there are those who say, "[[No individual can represent the market.]]"
