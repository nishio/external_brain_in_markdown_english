- [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] [Avoid discussion as much as possible
Discussions are expensive, don't you think?
I don't think that all discussions are unnecessary, but I think that the situations in which discussions are effective are limited to very specific cases. For example, university research laboratories or corporate R&D departments.
It is also important that you and the person you are discussing have properly aligned interests.
Focusing on the emotional aspect, [[the manner of discussion]] is actually not something that everyone has mastered so well, so the negative point is that discussions can leave emotional lumps in the air.
For these reasons, I basically believe that discussion is only a last resort, something we have no choice but to do.
I myself like to debate, and if I could, I would debate for the rest of my life.

First hand: "What kind of 'discussion' is this '[[discussion]]'?"

Tomoya Tachikawa
You mean this kind of exchange.

Nishio Hirokazu
Shall I continue? In that case, my next question would be, "What is the 'manner' of that 'discussion'?" would be "What is the 'manner' of the 'discussion'?

Tomoya Tachikawa
Let's pause for a moment. What's the debate about?

Nishio Hirokazu
I'll continue the story next time we meet!
Maybe "discussion is this kind of exchange" is a mistake, and the condition "verbally" is missing.
- [[Oral Discussion]] / [[Textual Discussion]]

Tomoya Tachikawa
Oh, surely it's too rough to lump oral and textual discussions together as a discussion.
This topic is interesting and I'll put it in the aging jar.

Tomoya Tachikawa
Just a note, since it has little to do with the main point, "What is the 'manner' of that 'discussion'?"
- →
    - You know, like having the claims, the evidence, and the data,
    - It's a collection of things like clarifying what is to be decided or something like that,
    - In this sentence, you specifically envision "[[Criticism should be made only against opinions]] and not against personalities."



[[Discussions are expensive.]]
    - [[time constraint]]
- There are only a limited number of situations in which discussion is effective.
- Do you and the person you are discussing [[have the same interests]]?
- [[emotional lump]].
