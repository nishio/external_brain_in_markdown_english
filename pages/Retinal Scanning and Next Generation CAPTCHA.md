title: "Retinal Scanning and Next Generation CAPTCHA"
---

2023-07-28 I had GPT4 clean up the chit-chat.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- A: It's interesting to see so many people lined up at the device developed by [[Sam Altman]] at OpenAI that scans the human retina.
- B: A system that offers monetary rewards (or tokens?) to users? B: The system provides monetary rewards (or tokens?) to users, right?
- A: Yes, there is the "providing money" aspect, but [[Sam Altman's]] goal is to build a platform that allows people to prove their "humanness" without depending on the state. The terminal in Shinjuku is already booked up, but I hope to get my own [[World ID]] soon.
- B: Okay, so you're not saying that you want to sell NFT at a higher price, but that you want a digital wallet that has the potential to become the global standard for the future?
- A: Wallets may conjure up images of wallets, but I personally don't place much emphasis on the monetary rewards (coins). I believe that, at least for the time being, the revenue earned in Japanese yen will outweigh it. What is more important is "[[Proof of Human]]" ([[Proof of Humanity]]).
- B: "Proof of Human"...does that mean something about voting rights or something?
- A: With the development of AI, it will become more difficult to prove that one is a human being when operating on the Internet. Currently, we verify through [[CAPTCHAs]] and the like, but there will come a time when those methods will no longer work. At that time, web services will have to use some other form of authentication to prove that you are a human being. It will not be possible to load [[my number card]] every time, and service providers will be burdened with certificates issued by many different countries.
- B: You say this is the next generation of [[CAPTCHAs]]?
- A: We can see this as a step toward that. We are faced with the question, "How do we create a means of proving that we are human? For example, Taiwan's Digital Agency is working to standardize distributed identity at W3C.
- B: Because [[the permanence of administrative functions]] is so important in Taiwan.
