title: "Dragon Task"
---

> I have been getting around much better since I started adding the following icons to my daily to-do management.
>  üçÖ: 25 minutes per piece. Relatively easy to estimate time. I'll run a pomodoro timer.
>  üçä: 25 minutes per piece. Time estimation is somewhat difficult and should anticipate the possibility of a significant extension.
>  üçë: 25 minutes per piece. Whether you can do it or not, or even if you can't "complete" something in the first place, you finish it exactly in that time.
>  üç≠: 10 minutes of relaxation.
>  üê≤: a big one that needs to be done without regard to time required. Dragon.
