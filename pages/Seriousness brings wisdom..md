- It was mentioned on Twitter as being from [[Kazuo Inamori]], but when I searched, I found multiple mentions of it being from [[Shingen Takeda]].
So when I looked up the "Shohan Glossary" listed as the source, there is a reference to "source unknown" as of 2015.

> This term was circulating on Facebook around 2012.

I have not been able to find a Facebook page for this person, General Manager Akaishi of ConyJapan.

It's almost certainly not Shingen Takeda or Kazuo Inamori.
