Stretching and Visual Thinking
- [[Ideas grow out of stretching.]]
- I realized there's an element of [[visual thinking]] that goes along with not having to use your eyes.
- In [[visual thinking]], it is similar to the feeling of "seeing" as images, rather than thinking in words.
    - "[[Craftsmanship]] doesn't explain, [[you]] watch and steal."
        - Craftsmen don't think in words, so they can't verbalize and explain.
    - [[Premonitions]]."
        - When you think of future projections in terms of images, you feel like you've "seen the future as images.
        - [[Understanding as the ability to predict the future]]
