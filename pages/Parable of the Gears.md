title: "Parable of the Gears"
---

Image with [[gear]] at the head, rotating.
- When it is working correctly,
    - Gears mesh with other gears,
    - It takes a moderate [[burden]],
    - It is turning at the appropriate speed.
    - If [[the gears mesh.]] is not [[racing (of an engine)]], it will be [[racing (of an engine)]].
    - The rotation is fast because there is no load.
    - But they are not meshing, so no output is produced.
    - How do we resolve the situation where [[racing (of an engine)]] is going on?
    - Impossible to engage while spinning at high speed.
    - We need to slow down first.
    - After engaging, when you try to accelerate again, the speed does not go up as fast as when you are spinning idle because of the load, but you think, "This is the right state of affairs.

I personally see it as a cog in the wheel image.
- If the gears don't mesh, it spins around a lot.
    - Rather faster than when it's running properly because it's not properly loaded.
    - But they don't mesh, so of course there is no output at all.
- what to do about it
    - Impossible to engage while spinning at high speed.
    - First, slow down and engage.
    - Re-acceleration after engagement is difficult because the speed does not increase as much as when idling because of the load, but we think, "This is the right state of affairs.
- Daily thoughts
    - Consider that "'Fast turnover is a good thing' is a false assumption."

- [[Slow down the gears.]]
