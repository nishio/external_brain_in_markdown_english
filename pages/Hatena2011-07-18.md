*1310972331*Task Management Diary 2
Previously: added a task to force me to look at my notebook every day, because I haven't gotten into the habit of looking at my notebook every day because I don't have a job that requires me to look at my notebook every day. Recording diet: Record your weight and what you eat in a schedule book that displays one month. This should inevitably lead to looking at the notebook after every meal, morning and evening weigh-ins.

Well, today is the 10th day since I started that task and so far it has continued. I have lost about 2 pounds, but this is because I was invited to try a weekend petit fast. I will never do petit fasting again because it makes me feel very sick. I lost one kilo from the petit fast and one kilo from holding down my normal calorie intake.
