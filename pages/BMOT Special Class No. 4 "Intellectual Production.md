title: 'BMOT Special Class No. 4 "Intellectual Production'
---

- 2018-10-10 Room 913, 9th floor, CIC, Tokyo Tech

- [[Transcript of BMOT 4th]] is now available. The writing at the bottom of this page was reconstructed from handwritten notes taken in class.
therefore
- Sometimes what you speak without taking notes is forgotten later.
- Questions from the audience that didn't fit well were naturally forgotten.
I think there would be a difference between the two. Which is better suited for rereading: reconstructed notes or transcription?


self-introduction
    - [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]
- My day job is [[Cybozu]].
    - Groupware company
    - Groupware is software used by a group (team) of several people
    - Its purpose is to improve team productivity

- [[Classes are physical education]]
- Many "classes" are just watching the teacher speak in PowerPoint.
- But there is a type of "karma (skill)" that is important to actually participate in the activity, like physical education.
- A "class" that imparts those kinds of skills.

Knowledge produced in the first class
    - [[Why invest in intellectual production techniques?]]
- Published in the Technical Review Booklet
- To be posted in a certain place soon

What is derailment?
- > The characteristic of Dr. Nishio is that his stories go off the rails at high speed (Mr. Tachikawa).
    - Rail Metaphor
            - [[No rails.]]
    - 'I'm using derailment in a positive sense!' 'Then what is the benefit of that positive meaning of derailment?'
    - The advantage is that you can immediately turn to something that looks interesting.

- Airplane Metaphor
    - No rails.
    - But we'll get where we're going.
    - Desire to lead us to the goal
    - The "reaching" metaphor
    - Target
    - A word similar to "goal," "objective."
    - What is the purpose of the hike?
        - I made a plan to climb up the mountain and come back down, found a beautiful stream on the way up, played there, and when I came to, the sun was going down, so I didn't climb up the mountain and came back down.
        - Should we hurry up and down the mountain as planned?
        - Is the purpose of the hike to follow the planned route?
        - scenery
        - Having fun
        - If the goal is to reach the goal, if you spend time enjoying the scenery along the way, you have to dash through the rest of the process
        - Television Parable
            - A device for one-way drip-feeding of information

- Associative Networks
    - hiking
        - Follow the associations
        - Associations are the way
        - Associations and hiking have similar structures.
        - Associations and hiking are analogies.
        - This is where the deep dive begins with the question, "What is an analogy?"

    - What is [analogy
    - Analogy is finding a subjectively similar relationship to an object with which there is no objective or logical relationship
    - For example, there is no logical relationship whatsoever between an increase in the price of a commodity and an increase in the price of a tako-age kite.
    - But we find a similar relationship in this.
    - Then develop it in the metaphorical space and then pull it back.
        - Kites fly because the wind blows.
        - So what does that "wind" equate to in terms of the price of the product?
        - Customer attention?
    - If the wind is too strong, the string will break and fly away.
        - What does this equate to in terms of commodity prices?
        - To be priced at a premium?
        - That the supply of goods cannot keep up?
        - It's a subjective relationship, so there are a number of answers.

- Real-world examples of using analogies in software development
    - First of all [[Notification points to]], I told him that search engines point to, but he didn't quite get it.
        - [[time machine]].
    - Apple's TimeMachine is a Time Machine to the Past
    - → What about a time machine to the future? Development in the metaphor space of
    - I'm going to pull that back.
        - Schedule management?
        - The computer will put you in the condition you expect.
        - When you schedule a videoconference, the videoconference will start up.
        - Future minutes are prepared in advance.
            - Forms to be filled are generated with the task
        - A competent secretary will prepare you ahead of time.
            - Behavior Prediction
            - Amazon Recommendations
            - Ships before it ships [Amazon gets patent for 'predictive shipping' - ships items before they're ordered | TechCrunch Japan [https://jp.techcrunch.com/2014/01/20/20140118amazon-pre-](https://jp.techcrunch.com/2014/01/20/20140118amazon-pre-) ships/]
- One of the participants was just recently at work talking about time machines.
    - That time machine was a time machine to the future.

Question from the audience How do you put together what you have expanded by analogy and association?
- In a word, KJ method
    - write out
    - Make it possible to list
    - Grouping
- Unlike when they diverge, this process is done quietly, alone.
    - Opinion that it is interesting to move hands
    - Personally, my goal is not so much to move my hands, but to reduce the burden of cognition by writing it down and not forgetting it.
    - [[The relationship between mental arithmetic and written arithmetic]], it's easier to do it visually than to do it only in your head.
    - You don't have to remember.
- Is one page in Scrapbox equivalent to one sticky note?
    - not match the correct (answer, etc.)
    - I made the same mistake when I started using Scrapbox.
    - But the sticky note is a much smaller unit.
        - The [[information card]] is B6 size, and [[Tadao Umesao]] thought it could not be used as a substitute for a full-fledged notebook if it were smaller than this.
    - On the other hand, he used a B8 size [[small stature]] for temporary processing when thinking about a sentence
    - A page in Scrapbox is a large unit, a sticky note is a small unit
    - A line of Scrapbox might be equivalent to a sheet of sticky notes.
    - What to write on the sticky note is explained in [[What to write on the sticky note]].

    - [[This Day in the Past" on Facebook]]


- It's verbalized in an attempt to explain.
    - There was some talk at the reception about how we picked up on a very remote topic very well, but whether it's remote or not is subjective.
        - [[Relationships where topics are connected.]]
        - [[associative connection]]

- What I think I failed to do last time.
    - Due to network conditions at the venue, the live broadcast was not possible, and no recording was made because it was thought that not many people would listen to it even if it was recorded.
    - I could have recorded it and transcribed it, I don't have the material to look back on.
    - I'll record it this time.

    - > I enjoyed listening to the lecture because it was not a lecture where you just listen to what is being said, but rather a participatory [[brainstorming]] type of lecture.
    - > I thought Nishio's use of sticky notes (just writing down ideas on sticky notes and grouping similar ones together) was an analogy of bringing something as abstract as "thinking" into the physical world.
    - > It was a great opportunity to experience first-hand the stories in [[The Intellectual Production of Engineers]]!
- [Twitter @raratiger](https://twitter.com/raratiger/status/1050055590758641664)
    - >  What is [[derailment]]? What is [[analogy]]? The conversation turned to classes with [[live performance]]. According to Mr. Nishio, "[[Classes are physical education]]".
