title: "Spoilers and episodic memory"

> [@raurublock](https://twitter.com/raurublock/status/671172622785183744?s=21&t=fmWnIlglRq28hkorJmvOtg): Human memory capacity can be divided into [[episodic memory]] and [[ semantic memory]], but memory tendencies also have a significant impact on whether or not [[spoiler]] is acceptable. Episodic memory-centered people consider "what kind of feelings I had when I first saw the movie" to be important, and they strongly dislike spoilers that spoil the feelings.
>  On the other hand, semantic memory-centered people do not feel much emotion on first viewing, but find enjoyment in gradually constructing and strengthening the [[semantic network (AI)]] in their brains through repeated viewing and thinking, and emotion arises as the semantic network grows. Spoilers are easily tolerated as part of this process.
>  It is difficult for people who rely strongly on episodic memory and people who rely strongly on semantic memory to discuss their impressions. People with strong episodic memory have strong feelings at the moment they see an image and want to talk about them on the spot. However, people with strong semantic memory have not yet developed a semantic network at that stage, and do not have many feelings or impressions.

- [[Finding enjoyment in the growth of a semantic network]]
- Very Scrapbox-like.

The reason I go to museums, theaters, and movie theaters alone is because I can't meet up with others at the same time. It is best to meet at the entrance of the art exhibition and meet at the exit, and [* I am still watching a play I saw 10 years ago and keep writing about it. The logic of "getting in the way of line processing" doesn't hold water.
