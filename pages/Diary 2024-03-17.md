Need a map to proceed when task neutral
When task-driven, externally given tasks pull
When you are task-neutral, you need to decide how to proceed on your own because you are not pulled in from the outside.


I don't see a goal to aim for, and of course I don't see a way to get there.
In the meantime, if there is an unoccupied fort, you can take it and use it as a base for exploration.
Wandering long distances without a base is (insecure/high risk).
