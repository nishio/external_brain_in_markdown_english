title: "They retaliate with a shotgun attack."
---

- Let's say you see someone on a social networking site saying something offensive.
- Attack that person.
- Vague language, [[the subject is large]] statements, and [[excessive abstraction]] at this time are like attacking with a [[shotgun]].
- Involving people who have nothing to do with it.
- Involved people feel "[[attacked]]"
    - [[Bug that makes you want to retaliate when attacked.]]
- People involved in [[retribution]].
