title: "The Summit Is Narrow"

---

- > In any field, as you approach the summit, the world becomes narrower. When you seek peers who can stimulate you equally in that field, you find that you can only work with people whose sense of greatness aligns with yours. The more you master your path, the more it becomes purified and concentrated. While you may feel exceptionally talented, you become increasingly isolated, except for a few comrades who mutually recognize each other's abilities.
