title: 'Pushing" against others is harmful interpersonal behavior.'

from  [[Nodal Point of Thought 2022-03-11]]
Pushing" against others is harmful interpersonal behavior.
This is written in a contrasting structure, but they share the same "push and shove."
> Young people want to experience things, I did too. That's what being young is all about. And there are some old people who push a lot of activities on you.
> There are old people who say, "You're young, you have to be exposed to new things," and there are old people who say, "You have to know your traditions.
I wonder if "[[push]]" towards others (regardless of age) is harmful [[interpersonal behaviour]].
