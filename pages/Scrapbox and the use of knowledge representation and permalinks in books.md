- Nishio's [[Scrapbox]] is fragmented and essential knowledge is easy to absorb and thought-provoking.
    - [[book]] is too large to point to information, but Scrapbox has a human-readable [Permalink.
- The [[knowledge representation]] of books is questionable and needs to be improved on the Kindle.
- It would be nice to have the ability to select the part of the permalink that we want to mention in the permalink.
- Ideally, the content should come first, followed by the title.

- In this case, there is a size of text appropriate to the content to be expressed, and books are in a bad state: "often too large," and "when trying to point to a part, page numbers are generally used, but with the advent of kindle-like e-books, broken links occur.
- Scrapbox, on the other hand, has a [[Human-readable permalink]] for each unit of content, and even if you rename it, it will be redirected to the next unit, which is a nice improvement.
- So, I have a lot of doubts about the [[Forms of Knowledge Representation]] of books, and I feel that we are not getting the benefits of the times when the concept of [Permalink. I have a feeling that I am not getting the benefit of the times.
- I think "go back to page-based books" is a bad idea, [if you change something and a problem arises, don't undo it, but change it further.
- And so I thought it would be nice to have the ability to select "places to mention" and create permalinks, and if you could give them human-readable names, even after the fact, it would be Scrapbox-like.
- It would be nice to have a list of the marked parts after reading a long sentence by selecting a part of the sentence and pressing the "mark" button (Kindle could do something similar up to this point).
- It would be nice if this grouping could be made into individual pages with titles, instead of just being lumped together in one view.
- Instead of pre-titling the content, it was in [[Content comes first]] and then [[Titling after the fact]].
