title: "frequency table"
---

- When there are N numbers and N is too large to do O(N^2)
- If the order of the numbers is meaningless and the number type is M, which is much less than N
- Creating a frequency table by type can reduce the amount of calculations.

- [[Frequency→Triangular number]]
- For any pair of two choices of N numbers, the case where two have the same value is counted
- A naive loop is O(N^2)
- Count the frequencies and for each value frequency n [[trigonometric number]] $T_{n-1} = n(n-1)/2$.
    - This would be O(N)

- [[multiset]] 、[[multiset]]
