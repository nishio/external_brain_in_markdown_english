I tried to visualize some kind of skin feeling.
- A: Opinions seem to be [[dividing into parts]] on social networking sites
    - It looks as if it may be clearly divided into red and blue clusters.
    - but this is a bias that mistakenly assumes that everything that is easy to observe is
- B: In fact, [[the silent majority]] is a huge lump with no clear boundaries
    - The red and blue that stood out were just [[small bumps]] in that big mass.

- So which is the majority can be arbitrarily controlled by how the boundaries are drawn.

impetus
- [62% in favor of "selective married couple surname", 27% opposed NHK Poll | NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240501/k10014437371000.html)
- [Selective surname for married couples, 16% "for" and 49% "against" survey of 2,000 elementary and junior high school students, questions and answers deceptive selective surname debate - Sankei News](https://www.sankei.com/article/20250101-L3VK2UL4H5EMJPW6X5DVUGNXJQ/)

relevance
- I initially wrote it as if the gray distribution encompassed the whole thing, but the [[political conflict]] picture is relevant, too.

    - Bias due to [[the more radical things you say, the more attention you get]].
