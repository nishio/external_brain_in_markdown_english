        - Added 2022-02-03 I'm drawing a direct collation as if it were a symbol-symbol collation, but isn't it a collation of felt meanings?
            - No, it's not. It's not good to try to paint with this kind of picture.
            - > Symbols are needed in any case for direct matching (p.112)
                - Because experience without symbols is an ambiguous entity with no clear boundaries that cannot be manipulated and compared.
                - The "experienced meaning" to which a symbol refers is checked against the "meaning of the symbol" to which another symbol refers.

                - If we're going to paint a picture of these two comparisons as a first step, it seems more appropriate to make a collation between the perceived meanings.
