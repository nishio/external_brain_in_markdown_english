title: "Better to be mad with the world than wise alone."

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Better to be mad with the world than wise alone.
cxxxiii
Better to be mad with the rest of the world than to be wise alone.

So say the politicians. If all is as it seems, one cannot be worse than the other, while solitary wisdom leads to folly. So it is important to sail with the flow. The greatest wisdom often lies in ignorance, or the pretense of it. One must live with others, but others are mostly ignorant. But I would turn the saying around and say, "To live completely alone, one must either be like God or like a wild beast." It is better to have the wisdom of many than the foolishness of one alone. Some seek to be original in their search for the chimera.
