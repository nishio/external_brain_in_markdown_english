title: "Beautiful model"
---

A clean model for the real world
- Highly symmetric model
- Beautiful to look at.

This is usually a distortion because it is made with the priority of "looking pretty".

- Phenomenon similar to [List of words
- Something like "The Five X's."
- The choice of words is not good because the goal is to match the initials.
