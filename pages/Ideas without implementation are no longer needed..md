- > Nineteenth century philosophy did not involve implementation. Nietzsche was limited because he could not implement. If Nietzsche had created Watson (*IBM's artificial intelligence), it would have been more robust. If Nietzsche had created Watson and then said, "Human beings are almost indistinguishable from artificial intelligence," and then published that book, I think it would have had quite a social impact. You can't create an ecosystem because [[a philosophy without objects has very poor presentation skills]]. [The best way to create an ecosystem is to show it as an object. We don't need any more "philosophy without implementation.
