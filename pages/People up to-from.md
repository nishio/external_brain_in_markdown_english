title: "People up to/from"

- I note an interesting expression by another person in relation to [The results briefing is not a goal, but a start.

The original expression is that there are "[[people up to the unexplored]]" and "[[people from the unexplored]]," but it is not specific to a particular concrete project, so it is abstracted below.

This is a type of project that has a [[results briefing]] at the end of a certain period of training, and there are "people up to the results briefing" and "people from the results briefing".

- (After writing all this, I thought "people up to and including adoption" and "people from adoption" were also possible.
- (Is this the same as "people to pass" or "people from pass" in college? Related: [[Start, not finish]].


- [[up to the ....]] / [[people from the same hometown]]
