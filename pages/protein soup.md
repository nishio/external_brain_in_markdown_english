Shaking powdered protein in a shaker was not a habit.
- I started with the idea of boiling water and drinking coffee in the morning, which had become a habit, so why not have some soup?
- I used up a bag.

impressions
- The first time you drink one, think of corn soup, you may be surprised that it is not as sweet as corn soup!
    - More like potato soup.
- I couldn't make it right with 3 cups of powder, so I had to use 2 cups.
    - Eventually I got used to it and could make even three cups.
    - I don't know what changed.
- Consider what has changed
    - Fill with freshly boiled water
    - Scrape the walls, corners, and bottom of the mug with a stick rather than a spoon to prevent sticking
