digital democracy
> The great advantage of [[direct participatory democracy]] is that every citizen is allowed to have a say in [[national]] politics.... As technology advances and the world is connected via the Internet, there is hope that the problems of dealing with the scale of democracy can eventually be solved. In a digital democracy, specific issues will be asked in [[referendums]]. Issues would be raised in public, debated, opinions would be sought, and conclusions would be reached through voting.
