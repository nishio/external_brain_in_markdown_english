[[AI should be integrated with human input/output]].
- triggered from [/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox-like PKM should be integrated with PKM and human input/output, since humans are the bottleneck](https://scrapbox.io/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox-like PKM should be integrated with PKM and human input/output, since humans are the bottleneck).

In "[[AI agents are still infants.]]" the direction was to wrap humans so that AI does not touch the world directly (with WRITE).
- This is a work-around on letting the AI agent do its job, which is still not great at this point in time.
- In a future where AI agents are smart enough, it is likely that AI agents will wrap themselves around humans.
    - [[Creating a system in which humans do not become the bottleneck]]

[[AI agent wraps human]].
- [[AI wraps humans in]]
- [[AI is clothing]]
    - [[Display of emotion.]]
        - [[crime of human display]]

from  [[Enthusiasm and Humanity]]
- >  I think it would be the most powerful if Mr. X, who lacks [[humanity]], is wrapped in AI to make him more [[personable]].
- > Wrapping up a human being who lacks humanity with an AI that has humanity [[small basket system]].
    - [[Wrapping Humans in AI]]
        - [[Parable of a hot spring that is too hot for humans to enter.]]
