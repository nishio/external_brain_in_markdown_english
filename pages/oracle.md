title: "oracle"

> An oracle machine or prophecy machine is a kind of abstract machine in computational complexity theory and computability theory.
> The Turing machine is a Turing machine with an additional black box called an oracle, which can decide a specific decision problem in a single step.

- Simply put, there is a discussion about how the speed of computation would change if we add an "oracle," a device that can complete a specific computation in one step, to a Turing machine as a model for "normal computation," and we skip such academic discussions and just call it [[parable]] as "a device that can finish a process different from normal computation in a short time" and call it an oracle. We call an oracle "a device that completes a different process in a shorter time than a normal operation.
- For the average person, [[Emotion Recognition]] is like an oracle that can be executed in a short amount of time without requiring linguistic thought, and those who do not have that oracle instead perform a similar process by [[linguistic turn of mind]]. We used the term [[software emulation]] to describe this in today's conversation. This is also a parable
    - A similar phenomenon is sometimes likened to "a machine with a GPU can do something fast using the GPU, but since it does not have a GPU, the CPU is taking longer to perform it.
