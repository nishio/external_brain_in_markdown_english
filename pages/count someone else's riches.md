title: "count someone else's riches"
---

> A man may count the treasures of others, but he himself is worth less than half a penny.
    - [[Avatamska sutra]]
- Counting what someone else has doesn't make it yours.
- Sometimes used to mean "don't envy.

Add the following sentence to make it a little different
> If you do not practice in the Dharma, you will hear many things.
- If you include this much, it's almost as nuanced as "If all you do is read books and don't practice, it's like counting other people's treasures and having zero treasures of your own.
