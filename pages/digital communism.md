- [[digital]]  /  [[communism]]
- Why Communism Didn't Work
        - [[capitalism]] because they lost the competition.
- Have competitive conditions changed since then?

- [[Bread and circuses]]
    - [[Digital entertainment]] is [[duplicable]] and therefore can be [[distributed (e.g. films, rice)]] inexpensively.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This memo attempts to reassess communism in our time through the concept of "digital communism."
- While communism has been cited as a reason for its failure to do well in the past because it lost out in competition with capitalism, the author asks the question, "Have the competitive conditions changed?" and examines the new situation in today's digital age.
- The "bread and circuses" refer to the food and [[entertainment]] given to stabilize the people in [[ancient Rome]].
    - The focus here is on the inexpensive and easy [[mass distribution]] of "digital entertainment," and the suggestion seems to be that digitalization may enable the re-enactment of communism in modern society.
- In other words, the development of digital technology is creating a new [[social structure]] in which the focus is not on "[[material]] competition" but on "sharing information and [[entertainment]]," suggesting the possibility that communitarian elements will once again be the focus of attention in this context.
