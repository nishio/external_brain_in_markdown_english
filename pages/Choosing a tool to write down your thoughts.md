Choosing a tool to write down your thoughts

I'm writing this in [[Apple Notes]]([Japanese name: memo](https://www.icloud.com/notes)) because I couldn't connect to Scrapbox when I was writing it.
- I was trying to take notes in [[Obsidian]] because of course you can't connect to Scrapbox on the plane.
- 'What is it that you use?' and then we talked about the requirements for [[a tool to write down thoughts]].
- Scrapbox is inconvenient in an unstable Internet environment when considered as a tool for [[writing thoughts down]].
- The "[[unstable Internet environment]]" is outside the scope of responsibility of the Scrapbox cloud service.
- but what about when you think of it as [[a tool for personal intellectual production]]?
- It is the individual responsibility of each intellectual producer to keep his/her own intellectual productivity high, and the user is responsible for the inconvenience of using a tool that becomes inconvenient in places with poor Internet connection, where the Internet connection is poor

Apple Notes is clearly a more secure tool for writing down thoughts.
- After using it for a while, not so much.
    - I was using it in a place with unstable signal and it crashed twice and lost my latest writing.

- Scrapbox
    - Free Scrapbox users are not customers.
    - Scrapbox's free users are not even utilized as a product.
    - Scrapbox's business model is not clear.
        - By reducing the resources consumed by a project, it becomes a [[Lifestyle Business]] and aims for an unexpected breakthrough.
        - It is actually being used as the foundation for Helpfeel.
        - But, well, I'm not sure if there is any technical necessity or synergy in Helpfeel's foundation being based on Scrapbox.
            - From the customer's perspective, they would want to control the editing rights of documents published in the company's name, and they may want to connect workflows such as reviewing updates before publishing them, which does not fit well with Scrapbox's design principles.
- Apple Notes
    - 'Apple Notes users are customers because they buy and pay for iPhones.'
    - That would be up to the "note taking tool" bundled with the iPhone.
    - But iPhone users are not choosing their smartphones based on their note-taking capabilities.
    - So there is no incentive for Apple to improve beyond the minimum.
        - I don't see it evolving to have Scrapbox-like functionality.
    - A position that would be nice if it appeared as a third party app like Evernote used to be.
        - Success will increase the value of the Apple ecosystem while pushing the risk of failure to third parties.
