> [@hrjn](https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1566945919446437889): [[risk premium]] means that the "expected" return is greater for the [[risk]], not a guaranteed return or a theoretical guarantee that the value will continue to increase... It does not guarantee a return, nor does it theoretically guarantee that the value will continue to increase....

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1566947139011641344?s=21&t=xAfnDP_xPg85aAyLqTv8Qw): There are a small number of people in the world who interpret the terms "risk premium" or "[[high risk- high reward]]" to mean "high risk means high return".

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1566949049433210880): If we divide the world into four categories, there are "those who take low-risk, low-reward", "those who take high-risk, high-return", "those who are successfully dictated to and take risks even though they can't expect much return", and "those who succeed in [[Forcing risk on others]]". Forcing risk on others".

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1567196110061719553?s=21&t=xAfnDP_xPg85aAyLqTv8Qw): Like subprime loans, what I was imagining was "10 people take a challenge, 1 person succeeds greatly, 1 person fails greatly, and 8 people take a blah blah blah gamble". I was imagining that if you gather 30 people in a salon and have them take a gamble: "If 10 people try it, one will succeed, one will fail, and eight will fail miserably," three will succeed, so you convince 24 people on that basis, and if the three who fail raise questions, you say, "Get the antis out of here! I was imagining doing this.
