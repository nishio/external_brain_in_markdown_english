title: "confusion of means and ends"
---

- Confusion of Means and Purpose
- Means and ends [[complex inter-relationship (as in the struggle between two types of vine over one piece of land)]]?
- At least when you say, "I'm here today to learn the means."
- Is it wrong to acquire means without a specific goal?
- For example, can the acquisition of means with the specific objective of "increasing [[self-efficacy]] by mastering the means" be considered purposeless?

    - Is [[Monarch Morality and Slave Morality]] relevant?
