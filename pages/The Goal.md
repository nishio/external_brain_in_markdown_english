- The Goal = corporate goal = to make money.
- There are too many different indicators, especially in the management of a factory.
    - As a result, we make the mistake of focusing on something that is not a measure of the achievement of this "making money"
    - Especially bad for "occupancy rates".
        - [Example of Incorrect KPI setting
- Financial Indicators
        - [[net income]] : Amount of money made
        - [[ROI]]: Amount of profit made in relation to the amount invested
        - [[Cash Flow]]: Money flows in and out.
- Values commonly used in factories, such as the number of units produced per hour, are not directly related to this financial indicator.
- Goldratt's proposed indicators
        - [[throughput]] : Percentage of money generated through sales
        - [[inventory]] : All money invested to purchase what you intend to sell.
        - [[operational expense]] : money spent to convert inventory to throughput
- Reducing production capacity by 100% to match market demand reduces throughput and increases inventories
        - Occurs when there is a [[dependent event]] that undergoes [statistical variation
    - You can slow down to suit the situation, but you can't go faster.
    - As a result, statistical variation is not averaged and lags accumulate
- Throughput is defined by [bottleneck
    - The bottleneck is "[[constraints]]".
    - Improve efficiency of bottlenecks
        - Devise a break time so that the machine does not stop.
        - Don't create something you won't need right away.
        - Do quality inspections before bottlenecks.
    - Reduce bottleneck load
        - If we can work on it in other ways, we'll channel it there.
    - Increasing non-bottleneck utilization creates inventory at the expense of operations.
        - Non-bottlenecks can afford to make more than the bottleneck can handle
        - Throughput does not increase because it is determined by bottlenecks
        - As a result, work-in-process inventory builds up.
    - [[Drum Buffer Rope]]
    - Pace of bottlenecks determines overall material input timing (drums)
        - Materials needed in the process after the bottleneck should reach the bottleneck by the time the materials pass through the bottleneck to get there
    - Reduce work-in-process inventory before bottlenecks by not feeding front-end processes at a rate faster than the bottleneck can handle (rope)
    - Accidents and other unforeseen statistical fluctuations are not a problem because there is power outside the bottleneck, but they are a problem when the bottleneck is affected, and there is a buffer to prevent the bottleneck from stopping.
    - [[The weakest ring determines the strength of the entire chain.]]
