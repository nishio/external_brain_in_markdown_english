Recognized the importance of information fragmentation and multifaceted association.
Having different rotation speeds creates problems and requires "softness"
The balance between the written word and the associative mood forms a metaphor that creates new meaning.
If an existing symbol does not accurately express the meaning felt, create a new bond to a symbol that is not normally connected
- He described it as "[[a]] soft bite."


The language is a blur.
- Fragmentation of information, multifaceted associations, and their "soft meshing."
- How does it affect you?

It is also possible to export some data from groupware to which AI does not have full access, which demonstrates the need for an "AI Dejima".

Exploring the relationship between "felt meaning" and "symbols," he recognized the importance of information fragmentation and multifaceted associations. Problems arose when they had different rotation speeds, and "softness" was considered necessary. Balancing the written word and associative atmosphere forms a metaphor for new meaning. When existing symbols could not accurately express the meaning felt, a new bond was created between symbols that would not normally be connected, which was described as a "soft bite".

Expressions such as "blur," "process," "river," and "movement" are thought to play an important role in the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information, as well as their "soft meshing." Combined, these elements could form a metaphor that generates new meanings.

The use of Scrapbox is abstractable; the initial input need not be random. The data source and write destination need not even be Scrapbox; some data can be exported and used from groupware to which AI does not have full access, which demonstrates the need for an "AI Dejima".

Nishio's research notes reveal the idea that we need to focus on the existence of "moyamoya" and how it becomes a word, and how words affect moyamoya. He also states that the word "process" does not feel right to him personally, and points out that the word "river" or "motion (motio)" is used. I feel that these perspectives are relevant to my research and worth considering in depth.

Q: How do expressions such as "blur," "process," "river," and "movement" affect the fragmentation and multifaceted association of information and their "soft meshing"? And can these elements be combined to form metaphors that create new meanings?
