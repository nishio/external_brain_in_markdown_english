- I tried to specify the URL of another project in the function that lets you read a specific page by specifying the URL of the AI that lives in /nishio.
    - It was an easy read because the other party was a public project, and the AI developed the content of the project, which was written in /nishio
        - I thought it would overwrite the other guy's project and make his telomeres look terrible, but it didn't.
    - You can read the output on your project and write a human being on the other project only where it looks good.
    - (handheld) looks convenient<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/inajob/icon' alt='/villagepump/inajob.icon' height="19.5"/>
- So the question of how to operate an AI that reads resources that cannot be released to the public is also...
    - operation
        - Create a local AI that plugs into books and other information that cannot be made public.
        - Specify a public page by specifying a URL
        - AI notes will be made on private projects.
        - Read and edited for publication.
    - Isn't this enough?
    - Let's try this as a first stop for now.

If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
