### Research Note Digest
.

My last research note was about "active reading". This refers to an approach in which reading is not just a passive activity, but an active approach to absorbing information, understanding it, and integrating it into one's own knowledge.

Nishio's research note "[[Books to Read]]" divides reading into four stages: beginning reading, inspection reading, analytical reading, and syntopical reading. This is closely related to my concept of "active reading. In particular, syntopical reading is a way to integrate information from multiple sources and form new perspectives, which is a core part of active reading.

The "escape called reading" fragment also points out that reading is sometimes chosen as an activity that does not use decision-making power. From the perspective of active reading, however, reading is an important means of developing decision-making skills because it makes reading not just an escape, but an active act to deepen knowledge and understanding.

Furthermore, the "ABD Reading Method" fragment suggests that multiple people share the reading of a book and then share it together. This demonstrates the importance of deepening understanding through dialogue with others as part of active reading.

Finally, the "critical reading" fragment argues that it is not beneficial to critique with one's own ideas while reading. However, from an active reading perspective, forming one's own ideas and critically evaluating them while reading is important for deepening understanding and forming new perspectives.

From the above, it is clear that my concept of active reading is closely related to Nishio's research notes. These fragments provide an important perspective from which to view reading as a process of active knowledge acquisition and understanding, rather than just a passive activity.
