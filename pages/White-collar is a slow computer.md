title: "White-collar is a slow computer"

- [[white-collar]] is a slow computer
Talk about AI replacing mainly white collar and not blue collar.
- Because white-collar workers were trained and turned into computers at a time when there were no computers.

Japanese idiom "[[one's forte]]"

A surplus is created for white-collar workers who do not have a job in hand.
- I guess I'll just have to move to a blue collar job.
- The argument is that even if they change jobs, they will be treated badly because they are "inexperienced, low-skilled newcomers".

Some "blue-collar [[contempt]] white-collar" workers will not lose their jobs, but some will [[suffer]] because they cannot accept the reality that they have to "quit white-collar work and start over as unskilled blue-collar workers.
- I deserve it because the poison of "condescension" only comes back to haunt me.

When we say "[[AI will take your job.]]" we are unconsciously excluding blue collar workers from the concept of what the word "job" refers to.
- Implicitly assuming that "it's not my job to do it."
    - This is condescension.
- You are narrowing your own possibilities.

The term "white collar" here is also low resolution because it was coined a long time ago.
- In the future, we need to think in more detail and with higher resolution.
- There are white-collar workers who will be replaced by AI and those who will not.
- Drucker's [[knowledge worker]] concept needs to be revisited and fleshed out further
    - Simply put, white-collar workers who are not knowledge workers are easier to replace with AI.
