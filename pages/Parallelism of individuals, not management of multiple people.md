Parallelism of individuals, not management of multiple people
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1666079494241931271) [[Management]] in [[Volunteer Organizations]] is difficult because, unlike companies, there is no [[compelling force]] of [[command and order]] based on [[contract of employment]]. I wondered how they do it, but I found out that they do not manage "several people" but "parallel" management of each person by "[[not discussing]]", "[[the person who wants to do it]]", and "[[deciding the time for the next meeting]]". I thought, "I see.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1666080230149349382) This form can prevent the phenomenon of [[waiting for communication]] or "[[social cut corners]]" or miscommunication causing [[the ball to drop between]]. This form can prevent the phenomena of [[waiting for communication]], "[[social cut corners]]", and miscommunication.
>  Next time, it will be "how to assemble" and "how to improve" by arranging the deliverables from those who want to put out, and it will be [[content management]], not [[people management]].

- [[brainstorming]] creates [a feeling of being heard
- How to take specific actions
    - Top-down decisions and assignments don't work.
            - [[volunteer]] So.
            - Because [[the chairman]] is not [[the boss]] with [[the right to command]].
            - Enthusiasm for action must come from within the individual.
    - The basic premise is that you can't create voluntary motivation in people who don't have it.
        - All we can do is reduce the opportunity [[for motivation to be compromised]].
        - So [[task]] is not decided first.
            - The task is clarified [[posterior]] by the "spontaneous motivation" that emerges.
        - Related: [[Enthusiasm is a valuable resource]].
- Specifically.
    - Clarify the date and time of the next meeting.
    - Those who want to do "~," make "~," and bring it back by next time."
        - Create an online venue for asynchronous sharing
        - Clarify that "bringing" means creating a page there.
        - The person who brings it will be the leader, and those who want to join will brush up on it."
            - When you make it, you automatically become a "leader".
                - Makes it harder to throw out.
                    - [creates a sense of responsibility
                - Depending on the state of the members, it's possible that no one will bring it.
                    - Visualize that everyone is "someone who wants to be irresponsible and have an opinion, but doesn't want to be a leader".
                - I'm guessing you're going to guess that in this case, there will be more than one case.
            - If you don't make it, you're considered to have come down voluntarily.

> [@satoru_takeuchi](https://twitter.com/satoru_takeuchi/status/1666209619067420672?s=20): @nishio I've done a few things, like "forget about things that no one does" and "if critical If critical tasks don't progress, the community disappears (leaders don't try too hard).

> [@takahashim](https://twitter.com/takahashim/status/1667728460385751043?s=20): @nishio This may not fall between the two, but something on the critical path may not meet the deadline! ...I'm wondering if it's a question of how to avoid burnout and increased load on certain people when trying to manage that.
