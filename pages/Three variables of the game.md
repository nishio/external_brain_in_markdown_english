- [[hurry when you must hurry]]
- [[continue what needs to be continued]]
- [[do exactly what needs to be done]].

- When I heard that "I supported the activities of [[energetic young person]], but my interest shifted to other things without [[Keep doing it.]]", I thought, well, young people [[cannot observe the value created by the passage of time]] as their own business, so [[ underestimation]], I thought it was inevitable.

- This past month has felt like "[[a]] rush."
    - A few mistakes have been made, but that's not important.
        - [[When everything seems under control, you're just not going as fast as you should.]]
- Switch gears to "[[continue]]" mode.
