title: "Writing is sealed off to expand your thinking."

    - [[Ideas grow out of stretching.]]
    - Maybe it's good to be in an environment where I can't look at my phone or computer for 80 minutes, let alone write anything that comes to mind.
    - Writing and reading and thinking is beneficial so that the thoughts don't go anywhere, but on the other hand, I feel like I'm tied to it.
    - It's like being sealed up, so that your thoughts are spread thin and wide, and you discover new connections.
    - It's floating around in pictures, so I'll draw it later.

supplement
- The stretching here is one-on-one stretching at [[Dr. Stretch]], which is more like a massage than individual stretching
- However, a massage can be done while sleeping, but with one-on-one stretching, you are awake because you are working on your muscles and controlling your breathing, there may be a difference there. I've never found massage to be effective in getting ideas flowing.
    - It may be similar to getting ideas on [[walk]], the difference between walking while reading and writing on a walking phone and walking without. However, during the actual walk, when an idea comes to mind, I stop and make a note of it, so the experimental conditions are different there
- An environment where you come up with an idea, but you can't write it down, you can't focus 100% on thinking about the idea, but you don't use 100% of your brain for other tasks, and if anything, your brain is bored, but you can't sleep.
