title: "Leading painters"
---

    - [[top-notch]] painters paint what they think is good.
- A [[second-rate]] painter paints what the public thinks is good.
- A [[third-rate]] painter paints what he thinks "the [[public]] thinks is good.

explanation
- Third-rate painters paint what they think "the public will think is good," but in reality it is not.
    - self-serving assumption
    - If you can actually draw "what the public thinks is good", you are promoted to second class.
- But first-class is not an extension of this. As long as it is measured by the world's evaluation, it stops at second class.
- A common misconception: "If you paint what you think is good, you're top-notch."
    - You've got your logic backwards.
    - Paint only what you think is good and often die unappreciated.

- I'm trying to find the source of this because I remember seeing it in something, but I haven't found it.
    - Pointing out that it is Fernando Pessoa.
        - > A first-rate poet says what he actually feels, a second-rate poet says what he thinks he feels, and a third-rate poet says what he thinks he must feel
        - Quite similar.
        - I guess I read someone else's modification/explanation of this as the original story, and that further denatured it for me.

- > Third-rate consultants speak by example
- > Second-rate consultants speak with data.
- > Leading consultants speak with their hearts.
    - > Discontinuous growth is not an extension of fact.
