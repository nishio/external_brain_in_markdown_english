### Summary of notes
.
The note from "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures Yet" discusses multiplying FFTs in the frequency domain.

### Relation to Fragment
.
The note and the fragment "pulse width modulation" are related. Pulse width modulation is a method of representing real values using averages along the time axis and, like the FFT, is used as part of signal processing; multiplication in the FFT and the representation of real values by pulse width modulation are related because they are both methods for extracting and manipulating signal characteristics.

### deep thinking
FFT and pulse width modulation are methods for analyzing signals from different perspectives, and their combination can be used for more advanced signal processing: FFT enables analysis in the frequency domain, while pulse width modulation enables analysis in the time domain. Combining these techniques makes it possible to analyze signals from both time and frequency perspectives, thus obtaining more detailed information.

### summary of thoughts and title
.
Advanced signal processing using a combination of FFT and pulse-width modulation."
