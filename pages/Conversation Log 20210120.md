<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The listening chat system will ask questions to encourage the verbalization of what has not yet been verbalized, which will then become the input for the Regroup to organize. The first priority task, then, is to output the logs in a format that can be imported into the Regroup, rather than for human viewing.

consideration
- The log output function for human reading is not yet implemented, so it's formatted by hand.
- The keyword statement right after "listen first" is odd.
- The key word being "end" is a bug.
- I pasted a task list containing newlines, which properly removed the newlines, but I should have also removed the consecutive whitespace characters.
    - Rather, when you paste something that contains line breaks, should each be a separate statement?
- Now that it's HTML, it's hard to see if you don't put a break between the quote and the question.
    - The output must be separated by whether it is to be sent to chat or the Web.
    - It's hard to see the quote on the screen, if this was a chat, the client would have put it in quote format.
    - I'd like to see the web client parse the output for chat.
    - Before it was arranged for easier viewing, it looked like the following
