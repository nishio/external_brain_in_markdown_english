### One example of a watermelon field solution
Once upon a time, there were five sisters of great reputation in the village.
One day, a corrupt landowner in the village wanted to marry off one of his wives.
"Anyone can give me one wife: !!!!"
The parents, who did not want to marry her, said, "Actually, only one of the five is a man. The landowner gave up and left.
But the landowner, out of revenge, told the whole village that one man was mixed in with the five sisters, and word spread throughout the village, and the five daughters were not allowed to go out.

Coffee Shop Story
1: There was a very popular coffee shop in town. The coffee had a unique taste, and many customers frequented the store.
2: One day, the owner of another coffee shop became a rival and wanted to know the secret ingredient of that reputable coffee shop.
3: The owner of a reputable coffee shop noticed and placed a small note in his store. It reads, "Our coffee has a special ingredient that sets us apart from other stores."
4: The next day, a rival owner placed a note in his store as well. We have added a special ingredient to our coffee as well." But that "special ingredient" was just water, which actually spoiled the taste of the coffee.

The interesting part of this story is that the "good behavior" of the owner of a reputable coffee shop is rendered meaningless by the "copycat behavior" of a rival store owner. The first store owner's actions were strategic and succeeded in confusing the rival. However, the rival shopkeeper acted without understanding it, and as a result, his store's reputation was lowered.

### Thoughts
: The structure is not what I intended, but I feel like I have expanded my creative horizons.
- [[Show, not tell]]

## take 2
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful flower garden of great repute. It was so famous that nobles and royalty would come and pick flowers to take home.

One day, the king came and said to the owner of the flower garden. I want you to choose one of the most beautiful flowers in the garden and bring it to my castle. I want it to decorate my queen's room."

The owner of the flower garden could not refuse the king's order, but did not want to lose one of his precious flowers. So he said to the king. In fact, there is only one flower in this flower garden that is poisonous and withers as soon as it is touched. Is that all right with you?"

The king did not want to take that risk and withdrew the order.

The next day, however, the owner of the flower garden went to the field and found a message from the king. The next day, however, the owner of the flower garden went to the field and left a message from the king: "I will stop picking flowers from this flower garden, but I will tell the whole kingdom that there are poisonous flowers here. Be careful."

Subsequently, the flower fields lost their reputation and people visited less and less for fear of the poisonous flowers.

This new story has the same structure as the first story about the watermelon patch and the five sisters. The pattern is that the protagonist's schemes, words and deeds end up having the opposite effect.

Once upon a time, there lived Takashi, an engineer who had developed a new type of solar panel. These solar panels were extremely efficient, capable of supplying enough electricity to power a house for a week on a clear day. However, villains who knew the value of these panels were targeting his house at night and plotting to steal the technology.

One day, Takashi embedded a message in one of the solar panels. One of these panels sends an electric shock. Touch it and you will get an electric shock."

The next day, Takashi returned home to find a sign outside his window. I put electric shocks in all the panels, by Electric Man.

Takashi was so surprised that he could no longer touch his own panels. And with the new solar panel technology no longer leaking out, no more thieves would come near his house.

However, Takashi is no longer able to use his own panels, so he can no longer make a living using those highly efficient solar panels.

In the near future in Japan, riding the wave of technological innovation, most people in urban areas had the latest AI assistants. This AI was optimized for each owner and provided support for daily procedures, work, and household chores.

1: A man named Tanaka was bragging that his AI was one day better than other people's AIs. He was using his AI with its special features to make his work more efficient and achieve outstanding results.
2: Hearing of his success, the townspeople began to ask Tanaka to show them the AI. Tanaka was proud and instead of refusing, he told them, "Inside this AI, I have planted a virus that steals my personal information and important data. If you touch it, your information will also be compromised," he told them.
3: The next day, Tanaka woke up to find his AI behaving abnormally. The message on the screen reads, "Virus detected. All information will be deleted.
4: A small note was placed next to it. 'I've laced it with a virus, by the AI tech next door.'

Sample Answers
Japan in the near future. For people who have trouble eating, a special food was in vogue that provided the daily nutritional requirements.
1: A woman named Sato had this special food in her house that was very expensive and very special.
2: One day, Sato proudly said, "There is a special ingredient in this food that only I can eat. If others eat it, they may get sick," he said.
3: The next day, when she opens the fridge, there is a note on the food container. 'I've changed the ingredients. by the food researcher next door.'

### Thoughts
: I like how you make Tanaka's AI think Tanaka's lie that "there's a virus in it" is the truth, instead of introducing a virus into the mix.

Understood. I will revise the story accordingly.

In Japan in the near future, many people in urban areas owned the latest AI assistants. This AI was optimized for each owner and provided support for daily procedures, work, and household chores.

1: A man named Tanaka was bragging that his AI was one day better than other people's AIs. He was using his AI with its special features to make his work more efficient and achieve outstanding results.

Tanaka was proud and instead of refusing, he told them, "Inside this AI, I have planted a virus that steals my personal information and important data. If you touch it, your information will also be compromised," he told them.
3: One day, however, his AI suddenly began to malfunction. Tanaka checked and found that the AI had issued an alert saying, "Virus detected. All information will be erased" alert.
4: Tanaka was surprised to see this and ran to the house of the AI technician who lived next door. The technician checked Tanaka's AI and said, "I don't see any actual virus. The AI was malfunctioning to protect itself from the virus you mentioned, thinking it was the truth," he explained.

Tanaka deeply regretted that his lie had caused the AI to malfunction and apologized to the engineers.
