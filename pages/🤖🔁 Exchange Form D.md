In his research on Gyojin Emorya's style of exchange, Emorya Gyojin focused primarily on world history.
With the birth of the "stronger gets stronger" mechanism of power accumulation, the primitive mode of exchange A became unsustainable, and mode of exchange B emerged, of submission and protection to the stronger one who has accumulated power.
Emiya Yukito's work on efficiency and strategy resistance of exchanges in matching problems and mechanism design (e.g., [[Top Trading Cycle Algorithm]]) probably does not take into account the
Exchange Mode D, as a "recovery of Exchange Mode A at a higher level based on Exchange Mode C," is a better reciprocation based on the mechanistic design studies generated by Exchange Mode C.

### Digest of Research Notes
.

Research on exchange style D explores the mechanisms of exchange in pursuit of mutual benefit. This includes elements of altruistic and egocentric behavior, relative and absolute thinking, domain abstraction and domain specialization, problem finding and problem solving, and status quo dissatisfaction and status quo satisfaction.

We also found some connections with Yukito Karatani's `exchange model X' and `DFM heat exchange structure'. These may complement the theoretical background of exchange style D.
- The `DFM heat exchange structure` had nothing to do with quicksand.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

In addition, we found helpful studies on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchanges in matching problems and mechanism design. These suggest practical applications of exchange style D.

In addition, the practice of the KJ method and the content of the "Let the chaos speak for itself" study group reaffirmed [[the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process]]. These provide clues to putting the theoretical framework of exchange style D into a concrete problem-solving context.

From the above research, it can be concluded that exchange style D is an important concept for understanding the mechanism of exchange for mutual benefit and for enabling efficient and strategy-resistant exchange. Future research should further deepen this concept and explore specific applications.

### questions and comments
.

- How can Exchange Form D be applied in the context of specific problem solving?
- Shouldn't we further explore the relevance of other exchange models and heat exchange structures to complement the theoretical background of exchange mode D?
- Studies on the efficiency and strategy resistance of exchange in matching problems and mechanism design suggest practical applications of exchange style D. Shouldn't we build on these studies to explore specific applications of exchange style D?
- The contents of the KJ method practice and the "Let Chaos Speak" study group remind us of the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process. Based on these contents, shouldn't we explore ways to put the theoretical framework of exchange style D into a concrete problem-solving context?
