The term "head big" (atama-dekkachi) is one of those expressions used figuratively in Japanese. Although the literal translation means "a big head," it does not actually refer to physical balance. The word has the following nuances

meaning
- The term "head-in-the-sand" often refers to people who have a wealth of knowledge and theory, but are unable to apply it to actual actions and experiences.
- Simply put, it is a somewhat critical description of someone who is [[knowledge-oriented]] and lacks [[practical skills]].

origin
- The image of this term derives from the growth stage of a child. Babies and toddlers sometimes give the impression of being "unbalanced" because their heads appear large in relation to their bodies. This has turned into a metaphor and is used to mean "knowledge and thinking are unbalanced and out of balance overall.

Examples of usage
- Sample Conversation
    - A: He always talks about theories, but never acts on them.
    - B: Yes, maybe a little headstrong.

- In the Workplace Situation
    - When a new employee is well versed in the theory books but is unable to move well in actual work, it is used in the form of, "He's still a bit of a head case and doesn't have enough experience.
