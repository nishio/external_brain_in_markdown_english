- I saw a picture of [[You don't notice the disability is gone.]] in my dream.
I woke up and painted that.
Then a linguistic explanation was given.

This is a case where I was sleeping, but sometimes I'm taking a walk and an image comes to me.
- It's happened many times, and I don't keep track of every single one.
    - [[Importance and scope of observation]] is a recent case.
    - I didn't have an iPad because it was an unexpected thought.
    - iPhone Notes

        - No other letters, just this one.

- [[Stationery defines expression.]]
- Even if you don't use the actual stationery, by getting used to using it and being able to [[emulate]] it in your brain, you will be able to output the expressions brought about by that stationery in your brain alone.
    - [[New doors opened.]] It might have something to do with that.
