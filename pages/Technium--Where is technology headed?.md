    - [[technium (Tc)]] -- Where is technology headed?
- [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2xfqvcV)
- Original title "What Technology Wants"
    - The book compares technology to living organisms and talks about the principles of their development. So the original title makes sense [[The Japanese title is strange.]].
