title: "The executive's job is to define and enforce culture and values and approve good decisions."

from [about what executives at large companies are doing - Software Transactional Memo](https://kumagi.hatenablog.com/entry/what-executives-do)

> To paraphrase the book, the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.
> To paraphrase the book, an executive's job is to [[define and enforce culture and values]] and [[approve good decisions]].
- [201909 - apenwarr](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201909)

> In short, executives attend (virtually) every decision-making session in the company through various human emulations. When I was younger, I used to call such a phenomenon a phantom.

> The executives rarely do [[decision-making]]. If something that cannot be approved is frequently brought up for approval, there is a problem before that.
>  The reason why only requests for approval are drafted that have already been decided to be approved is because executives determine [[corporate values]] and recursively impose them on the entire company.... Executives are (virtually) present at all the decision-making sessions that take place in the company through the [[emulation]] of various people. When I was younger, I used to call such a phenomenon a phantom.

> Every executive is responsible for enforcing the policy all the way down the chain, recursively.
>  All executives are responsible for the recursive application of the policy all the way down the chain.

> If the executive makes their own decisions and forces them downstream: the executive doesn't have enough information to make good decisions in detail, so the decision won't be optimal.
>  If executives make decisions and enforce them down below, decisions will be suboptimal because executives do not have enough information to make good decisions.
