I've tried using it, and it's certainly very powerful and worth pursuing when creating a service like Zenryoku Katsudo Boyfriend-kun, which is about how much you can remember about the user experience (how much information you can pack into a small number of tokens)...

Hmmm, I've tried to follow up, but it doesn't restore that well.

This interpretation is more likely to be correct.

- [[Paper peer review was GAN.]]
- [[Japan without confidence]]

[[Social Battery]]

- [[Countries in the demographic bonus period are strengthened by LLM.]]

The input and output ports of information need not be the same.
- The concept of a "social networking account" only temporarily produces "a bundle of inputs and outputs."
- Biologically, the ear and mouth are different, and even before the Internet, reading and writing were two different things.
- If so, is it natural for social networking accounts to have separate ears for information input and separate mouths for output?
- ↔ In some cases, output increases input.

- [[The place of the physical body is not the same as the place of the spirit.]]
