---

from  [[Diary 2024-04-26]]
Sticking to major clients was narrow-minded.
- When we made the decision to cut our major clients, who account for 60-70% of our sales, we began to see a new landscape.
- Not being swayed by major clients, the company has been able to strengthen relationships with other clients and acquire new projects more smoothly.
- He regrets that it was his own narrow-mindedness that caused him to stick to his major clients.
- Although risky, we keenly felt that we could not expand our company's potential if we were dependent on our main business partners.
- The company succeeded in receiving orders for prototypes from overseas manufacturers, which is a difficult task, and felt that there was room for growth for their company.
- We believe that we are now at a turning point for our company and have made the decision to cut off a major business partner that has been with us for 40 years.
- The key to his future success will be his own determination and the empowerment of his employees.
- Although there is uncertainty, we have found room for growth by taking on challenges in new fields while respecting our company's origins.
- We will be able to confidently promote our company at next week's sales visit.
