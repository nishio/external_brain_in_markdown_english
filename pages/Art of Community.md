- The Art of Community - How to connect "[[A desire to contribute]]" to lead to results
- 2011/5/26
- [[Jono Bacon]] (Author), [[Yoshiki Shibukawa]] (Author)
- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2viw2xS)

- Practical [[organization theory]] in the context of an open source community, a situation where there is no enforcement through employment contracts.
- The book is written by the Ubuntu community manager himself, so there are many concrete episodes
- On the other hand, it is messy because it is not organized and linked to the context of existing organizational theory
