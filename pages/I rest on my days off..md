    - I asked my wife, who was watching next to me at this point, what she thought.
        - "The other party didn't want to know what you were doing on your day off, they just wanted to [[show that there was no hostility by having the conversation]]."
        - You didn't understand what they were expecting, but you did respond, so you succeeded in showing that you don't have [[hostility]]."
        - We determined that there was no particular situation that required follow-up."
    - Well, it's the vacations.


[[It's my day off, so I'm resting]].
- [[I must rest on my day off.]]
- [[I need to rest on my day off.]]
[[must rest]]
