I have tried to set [[dot-notes]] to [[Expedition Net]] for meetings that roll along like [[brainstorming]] without a clear agenda, and I am personally quite satisfied with the results, but I can't publish them.

I haven't done the island dori yet.

What was good about it.
- Sometimes they touch on related topics several times in a single meeting.
- If you take [[minutes]] in [[time series]] from the beginning, this will fall apart
- This meeting [[rough sketch]].
    - Important lines are clearly defined by several layers.
    - [[Parable of the Drawings]]
