title: "Apology rather than asking for permission"
---

The idea of not asking permission to implement ideas and dealing with problems as they arise
- Acting optimistically in uncertain situations
- If a clear reason is required [[in advance]] to try something, it is impossible to try something [[uncertain]].
    - [[search]] is inhibited, slowing the rate of knowledge acquisition and, in the long run, leading to decline due to lack of knowledge.
- In order to generate new ideas and innovative solutions, it is necessary to think and act freely without being bound by existing frameworks and constraints

    - [[If it's a good idea, don't ask permission.]]
    - [[In times of uncertainty, be optimistic.]]
- Instead of taking locks in advance, run it and redo it when conflicts arise.
        - [[trade-off]]. Whether optimistic is right or not depends on the situation.

### Summary
.
He advocated the concept of not seeking permission to implement ideas and dealing with problems as they arise. He stated that it is important to be optimistic in uncertain situations and to understand the tradeoffs.

### Relevance
.
Nishio's research note, "If a clear reason is required [[in advance]] to try something, [[uncertain]] things cannot be tried. [[search]] is inhibited, leading to slower knowledge acquisition and, in the long run, to decline due to lack of knowledge." This is related to fragment X, which says This note and X share a common perspective on the importance of action and search in the face of uncertainty.

### deep thinking
This note encourages flexible thinking, acting without fear of uncertainty and dealing with problems as they arise. This reflects the notion that in order to generate new ideas and innovative solutions, we need to think and act freely without being constrained by existing frameworks and constraints.

### summary of thoughts
Innovation comes from the flexibility to act without fear of uncertainty and to deal with problems."
