What is Great Masculine Renunciation?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This refers to the phenomenon of a major change in men's fashion, especially in Europe, from the late 18th to the early 19th century. Until then, men had also worn luxurious and ornate outfits, but from this period, simple and practical clothing became the norm, avoiding ornamentation and flamboyance. This change is thought to be related to social change and changing gender consciousness.

[[Beau Brummell]] was an English fashion icon of the early 19th century who emphasized simplicity and sophistication in men's fashion. Some of his famous statements include.

“To be truly elegant one should not be noticed.”
To be truly elegant, one must not stand out."
This statement epitomizes his style philosophy, which is to avoid flashy decorations and emphasize simple, sophisticated attire.

[Great Male Renunciation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Male_Renunciation)
- > A historical phenomenon at the end of the 18th century, wealthy Western men stopped using bright colors, elaborate shapes, and variety in dress and left women's attire to their own devices. Instead, men concentrated on the minute differences in cut and the quality of plain fabrics.
- > Flugel claimed that the men "abandoned the claim to be considered beautiful" and "henceforth aimed only to be useful."

I can't find any source that directly says so, so it must be a later interpretation.
