title: "Forget to bring books"
---

- Forget to bring your own books to events, etc.
- People often say to me, "Why don't you just bring it and sell it by hand?"
    - I have a rather large inventory at home.
    - To give to others, not to sell.
        - Something to give to someone who should read it but would not buy it themselves if I recommended it.
        - I handed them out to the creators of Unexplored Jr. This is a typical use case
- Why forget to bring it?
    - I'm not unconsciously focusing on it.
- Financially, they're getting a discount on the author's discount, so if they sell directly to us, we'll make a profit.
    - mere trifling sum
- Time that should be used for questions and communication after the event.
    - It's irrational to consume it for the nonsense of "selling stuff and making a few hundred dollars."
- As for "selling books," there are specialized ways to do that, like Amazon, so let them do that.

- Signatures are similar.
- Do it when asked, as a fan service.
- I hate it when people say things like, "Let's do an autograph session."
    - The labor of writing by hand is imposed on them.
    - I have nothing to gain.
    - Especially when there is a line, people will line up even if they are not looking for a line for the same reason.
    - No one benefits.
    - The only people who are happy to have a line are those who want to feel like they're "the big guy".
    - I don't ask for autographs myself, so I don't really know what people who want autographs are looking for.
