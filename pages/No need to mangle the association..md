- The fact that "[[suggestion]] was made"
- The fact that this phenomenon occurred is itself a fact.
- This is a [[come from a person of one's own volition]] phenomenon.
- It would be a waste to throw away the fact that it occurred without recording it.
- But only "[[Weak links]]"
- Trying to describe them as if they were "[[Strong Links]]" is unreasonable.
- What is a strong link?
- Links that are obvious to anyone who sees them
    - [[Justified links]]
