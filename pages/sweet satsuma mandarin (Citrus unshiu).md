I'm really sorry to say this, but the monologue "Is there no place for me to be as I am? I think it's really scummy.

> [mt_yamamoto_](https://twitter.com/mt_yamamoto_/status/1671667319884611586) A woman who was troubled by her abnormal constitution and could not enter into an old-fashioned marriage got a place as a warrior, and as such, her purpose in life was "to I want to be married to a nice man! This is a roundabout way of saying that in today's world of dogmatic images of "strong women", it is a category of diversity, but there is no way that the feminists of the sex-hating cult can accept such a situation.

> [mt_yamamoto_](https://twitter.com/mt_yamamoto_/status/1671516974340292617) It's the same as the fact that female characters in Western video games are all wearing mohawks, but the "correctness" that these people espouse is only the opposite of correctness. The only axis of "correctness" is "how men see you", which is far from "freedom" and "diversity".

This Mr. Purgatory is also cool...
- > YazMatsuki []](https://twitter.com/YazMatsuki/status/1672000734160891907) It's the same woman who says to Nandoroji, "What's with that hair color...Oh my God, he even has a sword...is he kidnapping people? I feel that it is also the same woman who is prejudiced against Nankoroji, and that it is also the same woman who is prejudiced against Purgatory, and that it is also the same woman who is prejudiced against Purgatory, and that it is also the same woman who is prejudiced against Purgatory.
