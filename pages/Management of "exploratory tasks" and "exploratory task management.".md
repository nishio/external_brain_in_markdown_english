> [rashita2](https://x.com/rashita2/status/1874586966953795727) I think it is better to distinguish between "exploratory task" management and "exploratory task management". The former may not even fit the concept of "management" to begin with.

Exploratory Task Characteristics
- Goal is not clear.
    - Examples: "come up with a concept for a new service," "try out an unknown technology," etc.
- Hard to subdivide what to do in advance.
    - Example: Requirements definitions and deadlines are vague, and it is difficult to foresee where to go from here.
- You don't know what the challenges are until you try.
    - Example: A different problem is discovered when a prototype is run, and it takes an unexpected turn.

For these reasons, "exploratory tasks" are difficult to handle in ordinary task management (making a to-do list, following steps, and setting deadlines to manage progress).

Specific examples of exploratory task management
- (A) First, select "Do not manage".
    - Don't dare to set up a schedule or Gantt chart from the beginning.
    - Write down keywords and clues that interest you, and start prototyping and researching where you can.
    - Write down ideas as they come to mind in an "idea box" or similar (organizing will come later).
- (B) Loose structure + periodic checks
    - Weekly or bi-weekly review
        - Where were we? What have you learned? What new topics are you interested in?"
    - Identify "points of interest" rather than a list of things to do
        - Enumerate at the level of "questions to be explored more deeply" or "hypotheses" rather than specific tasks.
    - Even if a deadline is set, it is only a "guideline".
        - Not for meeting deadlines, but for "reminding" to review regularly.
- (C) Flexible management using AI
    - Chat AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to summarize "unorganized ideas" on a regular basis
        - Read the summary results and select "this one looks interesting" or "this one is a dead end.
    - Aggregate notes in [[Devin.ai]], etc., and "re-discover" each task as needed.
        - A system that makes it easy to pick up a story once put on hold and pick it up again later.

The former "does not fit into management in the first place."
- Since "exploratory tasks" are truly in the "[[let's]] just get moving" stage, the traditional managerial perspective is not yet a good fit.
    - If WBS or Gantt charting is done out of the blue, it needs to be reviewed every time it is moved → tedious and prone to breakdown.
    - Rather than forcibly managing ideas in detail, it is easier to proceed by first diverting ideas, checking them periodically, and then throwing them away in unnecessary directions.

The latter is "a device to assist in the search."
- Exploratory task management" is an approach that visualizes the destination of exploration, rather than managing it neatly from the beginning.
    - If left completely unchecked, there is a risk of stagnation without "[[knowing]] what to do.
    - Therefore, introduce a minimum of periodic reviews and AI summaries to allow for "[[early detection of]] dead ends."

summary
- [[Exploratory Task]]: [[Trial-and-error type task]] with [[unclear goal]]. Does not fit into traditional [Task Management
- [[Exploratory Task Management]]: A "loose structure" or "periodic checks" are introduced to facilitate progress in this state, and minimal support is provided.

In short, the theme of "exploratory task management" is how to handle "exploratory tasks that may not need management in the first place. The key point is not to force them into a management mold, but to be conscious of a style that supports them so that they do not get stuck, while leaving them to their own devices in moderation.
