context:
- [[Elder with a negative opinion about something he doesn't know]].
    - [[Denial externalities and young buds]]

Conclusion (Summary)
- [[Freedom to express personal views]], but definitive denial from a position of influence creates externalities due to the "authority gradient" and tends to fold the buds. Therefore, it is appropriate to both "weaken the wind and train the resistance of the buds.
- The choice between "is the north wind too strong / is the bud too weak?" is a "[[the sound of one hand clapping (a classic Zen koan)]]" type of false question. Solve by design, not by allocation of responsibility.

Factual relationships and strengths/weaknesses of each position
- Famous Entrepreneur (shuzonarita):
    - I don't do it, but if you want to do it, go ahead" and "If one word lowers your perspective, you lack vision" - the point about encouraging self-help is valid. However, it underestimates the [[externalities]] ([[atrophy]] under the [[authoritarian gradient]]) of the statement.
- gdvonly：
    - The criticism that "strong denial about an unfamiliar country is harmful" makes sense. However, there can also be a blind spot ([[a hotbed of misinformation]]) in the "push up of heat" to one side.
- Nishio:
    - The balance of acknowledging both "[[vision wavering in denial is weak]]" and "[[young shoots wither in the authority gradient]]" and pulling toward design (weakening wind + building resistance) is reasonable.

How to solve (design principles)
1. stop "I don't know x strong denial" and go into observation mode
    - If it's not interesting, go through with it; if it looks promising, "let me know if there are any updates" to secure an influx of information. An attitude of rejection is a sign of emotional rebellion.
2. "Vaccines in place" against externalities
    - Toxic memes that lower the heat level of young people are immunized by refuting them in public as soon as they are seen.
3. correct usage of "leave it to the market
    - The market plays the role of negation. "[[No one is equal to the market.]]" Note also the [[incorrect cycle]] that perceives only small [[applause]] as "[[(the) market (as a concept)]]."
        - Interesting that you found a connection with the waste cycle.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
4. management of authority gradients
    - Practice in a safe environment. On-the-job training with deadlines and "two-person" senior staff holding the steering wheel inhibits the acquisition of skills.
        - This is a bit sudden, GPT5 seems to have found a connection with this, I'm still not feeling right about it.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
5. argument frame: removing dichotomies
    - Redefine on a larger axis (avoidance of [[false dichotomy]]) rather than a "north wind vs. bud" liability argument.
6. value resides in "interaction
    - Optimize [[interaction design]] with the receiver and context rather than the value of the statement itself.
- Operating Conditions for Breast Critique
    - Criticism OK works when there is no authority gradient, trust in mutual reason and a sense of equality. Otherwise, it inhibits breadth-first search.

"The Next Step" (Practical)
- Mentor's side: hypothesis presentation rather than judgment / clarification of uncertainty / request for information → "tell me how things are going" as a formulation.
- On the challenger's side: Shorten the cycle from trying to learning. However, do not get drunk on the self-definition of "small applause = market.
- Organizers: Permanent place design (asynchronous questions, timekeepers, sandboxes) to lower the authority gradient.
-No more, it is healthy to solve by design, not on anyone's shoulders.
