title: "Is there an AI with multiple personalities?"
---

Q: Is there more than one [[individuality]] AI?
A: An example of the difference between "my data" and "/nishio's data".
- What is "individuality?" I don't have an answer to that question, but I can at least say that user experience varies depending on the original data.

from [/omoikane/chat page 5](https://scrapbox.io/omoikane/chat page 5).

- Talk about putting AI in your own wiki.
    - My motivation in the beginning was to show the related pages of my wiki
    - And while we're at it, you can interact with the AI, so it feels like you're tasting it.
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/omoikane/nishio/icon' alt='/omoikane/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I find it interesting to move it with the data of Mr.
            - I'm not sure if it's interesting because he's a stranger or if <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/omoikane/nishio/icon' alt='/omoikane/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>'s data is suited for this kind of thing.
