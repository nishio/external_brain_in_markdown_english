- [[Eugene Gendlin.]] ([[Eugene Gendlin]], 1926-2017) was a philosopher and psychologist, best known as an advocate of "[[focusing]]." His philosophy has a unique system of thought that focuses on the relationship between experience and meaning. It is organized and explained below.

1.  [[process of experience]] （[[Experiencing]]）
At the core of the Gendlin philosophy is the concept of "experience process.
- Human experience exists as [[a flow of ambiguous wholeness before it is verbalized]], not as mere sensations or feelings.
- This is also called "[[felt sense]], [[felt sense]], [[Felt Meaning]]," and refers to an ambiguous sensation that cannot yet be put into words, but is certainly felt in the body.
→ For him, philosophy and psychotherapy are activities that access this "[[preverbal]] experience" and create new expressions and understandings from it.

2. interaction between language and experience
- Gendlin believed that "[[language]] must be rooted in experience.
- [[Words have meaning when they come into contact with experiences]], and experiences are organized and expanded by words.
- This [[reciprocation generates new insights]].
There is uniqueness here in its emphasis on [[corporeality]] and [[generativity]], as opposed to a mere analytic-philosophical view of language.

3. "[[Implicit order]]" ([[Implicit order]])
- The human experience always includes the possibility of "[[how it]] will unfold next.
- When an unspoken, ambiguous feeling (implicit) encounters an appropriate word or expression, it becomes clear, "Yes, that's it," and develops into a new understanding.

- This process is supposed to be a source of philosophical contemplation and [[creativity]] as well as psychotherapeutic change.

4. focusing and philosophy
Gendlin is also a practitioner of [[psychotherapy]] and has systematized the methodology that emerged from his experience as "Focusing.
- A method of deepening [[new awareness]] and [[self-understanding]] by bringing the client's attention to the process of his or her own experience.
- Philosophically, the experience itself is "[[the]] material of thought" and is emphasized as a fundamental dimension that precedes theorizing.

5. impact and positioning
    - Gendlin's characteristic is that he continued in the vein of [[hussar]] and [[Merleau-Ponty.]]'s [[phenomenology]], but connected it to the practice of psychotherapy.
- The position that "thought is rooted in experience" is closer to [[pragmatism]] and [[existentialism]] than to the formal logic of analytic philosophy.
- In his later philosophy, he developed a [[dynamic understanding of existence]] that could be understood as "[[process philosophy]].

summary
Gendlin's philosophy can be organized as follows:
1. emphasis on "experiential process" before language
2. new meanings are generated through the interaction of language and experience
3. "Implicit order" directs the following understanding
4. practical ideas bridging philosophy and psychotherapy
