He developed a critique of sex, desire, and power relations in literature, film, and culture, relying especially on the theories of [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]].

One of Bersani's most famous works is The Freudian Body (1986), in which he rethinks the relationship between body, sex, and desire through Freudian theory, offering a new perspective on human identity and subjectivity. His critique explores in depth the impact of sexual desire on individuals and society and its relationship to power structures.

In his seminal work Homos (1995), he develops a discussion of homosexuality and social exclusion, arguing that homosexuality has social and political implications that go beyond mere sexual orientation. Bersani's theories have also greatly influenced the development of queer theory and poststructuralism.

His criticism, often understood as a challenge to conventional authority and norms, offers a new perspective on the study of literature and culture.
