title: "Solve for each connected component."
---

Given a graph that is not necessarily connected, it is often the case that when it is divided into connected components, the different connected components do not affect each other
In such a case, first divide the graph into [[linkage components]] and then solve them individually, which is easier with the restriction that they are connected graphs.

If it is a consolidation, for example
- There are trees throughout the area.
- V-1 or more sides
- If the side is V-1, it is a tree

- [[problem transformation]]
