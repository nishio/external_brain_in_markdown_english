title: "Automatic Grouping"
---

Should there be no automatic grouping of paths?
- Inaccuracy of grouping.
    - Right now, it's a process that says if there's an interval of about three seconds.
    - It's one thing if there's no actual space between them, but it's another if they're spatially separated.
- Explicit grouping in pieces?
- Do it as it is now to get data, and then gather examples of failures.
