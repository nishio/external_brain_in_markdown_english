Don't think you're "better at it" just because you're better at it than the majority.

Either I'm good at investing, or the majority of people in the world are just too bad at it and there's an upside.
- Probably the latter.
- As an image, if you plunge the entire nation into a FPS game world where 100 people suddenly battle royale, the majority of people will stand there because they don't know the direction of operation, or they can't shoot people with a gun! and they are easily shot and die.
- I have some experience in the game and can headshot without hesitation, so I can play to my advantage while those people are in the majority.
- But when 90% of them are dead and there are 10 left to fight, I'm not a good FPS player, so I can't come in first place.

[[DeFi]] sounds interesting, but it's probably a den of top rankers!
