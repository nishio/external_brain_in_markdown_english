When they forget to learn, lose the [[humility]] to care for [[the weak]], and begin to trample on the dignity of others with impunity, they become a [[detriment to society]]. Keep in mind that age is irrelevant." (Kumiko Torikai, [[Intercultural Communication Studies]], Iwanami Shinsho, p. 137)

This page is auto-translated from [/nishio/異文化コミュニケーション学](https://scrapbox.io/nishio/異文化コミュニケーション学) using DeepL. If you looks something interesting but the auto-translated English is not good enough to understand it, feel free to let me know at [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en). I'm very happy to spread my thought to non-Japanese readers.
