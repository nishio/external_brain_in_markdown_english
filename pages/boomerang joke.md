title: "boomerang joke"
---

A joke that enjoys the composition of a person A who makes a certain claim X against a person A whose actions can be criticized using that claim X.
- The image "[[boomerang]]" is used to refer to this type of situation, as in "I threw a boomerang and it came back and hit me.
- The term "boomerang joke" was coined by Nishio.

Personally, I feel like I am solving a logic puzzle, but when I tell it directly to person A, it is usually emotional, so I take it out of context and put it in the form of a joke.
- I call these real-life events that were preceded by real-life events "natural boomerang jokes."
    - It's hard to find good quality natural products.
    - So now it's more of a synthetic thing.

If I accumulate some, I'll make it into a "boomerang joke collection".

- I'm not particularly interested in the jokes, I collect them for their compositions, so [[boomerang-like structure]] or [[boomerang composition]] might be a more appropriate name.
