title: 'Is that an X?" "Is that an X?"'
---

A: [[Isn't that X]]! (critical tone)
B: X?

A identifies subject O with X.
- And B doesn't share that.
- A assumes, implicitly, that "X is evil," and he's doing it to blame.
    - Argument as to whether O and X should be equated
    - → Derived from [Is that an X?" or "What's an X?"

concrete example
- A woman has certain feelings for an underage man, which she calls "meloie" and says "this is not sexual desire."
    - The debate over whether "mellowness" is a sexual desire
- The issue of "is this pornographic or not?" in a discussion about pornographic advertising in public places is not a good idea.
    - For example, a high school girl in a swimsuit of the level of exposure allowed at a public swimming pool is depicted in an advertisement at a train station.
    - Debating whether a "socially acceptable level of swimwear" is "erotic."
    - (Personally, I would be concerned about whether it is acceptable to wear a socially acceptable swimsuit in a swimming pool at a train station, but that is not the subject of this page.)
        - (To begin with, the other side's argument is that the gaze that treats women like objects, no matter what they are wearing, is harmful, so whether it is erotic or not is off-topic.)
