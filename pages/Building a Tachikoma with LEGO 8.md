I bought the parts for the smaller Tachikoma while I was buying the parts to make Carrie, so I made the smaller one first.

- Hands don't stick like the original, T-bar is too short?
- What a surprise, the white round tiles were sold out and I couldn't buy them.

What's missing.
- green
    - dish
    - Lamp Holder x 4
    - Vertical Clip x 4
    - 1 x 3 plate x 3
    - 2 types of brackets
    - Tile 1 x 2
- Oh, I didn't get around to it.
- Carrie's seams are connected in a different way because the original parts were missing.

A lot of black sticks are left over, I wonder if they can be used for something.

Let's name the other Tachikomas as well, because it's inconvenient to have more types and no names to call them by.

- I didn't have any blue parts so I did it just right and it ended up looking like Chao's...
- Leg joints have a single clip handle, so if you spread the legs a little, they will collapse under their own weight.
