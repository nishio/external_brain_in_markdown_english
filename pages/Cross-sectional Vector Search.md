title: "Cross-sectional Vector Search"

- [[Cross Search]]
- We've been doing keyword exact match cross search of our collection for a long time.
- 2022's [[pLinkSuggest]] allows "search for a sentence by sentence".
- The advantage at this time was that by taking the "common string of ambiguous matches", it became clear "why the sentence was suggested".
- Vector search alone is the same as mere recommendation
    - I don't see why it matters.
- 'Are the hits relevant to the current theme?' If so, in what ways? If so, in what ways?" You can go so far as to have them explain

- > "Are the hits relevant to the current theme? Or not? If so, in what ways are they relevant?" to the point where they are asked to explain
- You noticed this back in April.
- As of September, we think this is really important.
- The term "recommendation with context" was coined.
