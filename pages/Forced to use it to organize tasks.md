title: "Forced to use it to organize tasks"
---

I was told that the listening chat system is not suitable for organizing tasks when there are multiple tasks because it digs into a single task, so I tried a crazy experiment: if that's the case, why not open a chat for each task?
→Conclusion: Objective achieved

consideration
- Open a separate chat for each task and you can drill down individually.
    - That's not the way it was done in the Mattermost era.
- Crystallization of the previous task to a question of value will have a positive impact on the later task.
    - The language in the #2 chat about the importance of the rate of keyword increase gave a strong raison d'être to task #5.
    - Before I started, I thought maybe number 4 would be next.
- The more detailed the individual tasks, the easier it was for humans to prioritize, and the zero chat was in phase mode and not asking questions.
    - It would have been hard to do a recap on each of the five tasks if we had had questions.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>How to end this dialogue? First idea, "What just happened?" with the appearance of "I see" and verbalization of the content of the awareness, then "Is this a good place to end?" and if "Yes", then end; second idea, "What happened?" or "Is this a good place to end?" with machine learning.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of dialogue is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The human side gets tired, and the quality of the questions usually declines and the end of the session becomes unpleasant. It's exhausting on the human side, and the quality of the questions generally declines as you run out of good keywords, leading to an unpleasant ending.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of side is that side?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>NGKW side

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The longer you keep doing this, the worse it will get unless there is a sufficient supply of good keywords from humans.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Another thing that came to mind during the first chat, looking at the extracted keywords for each step in the early stages, there may be a difference between cases that develop well and those that do not. We could use that to detect situations that don't seem to work and give advice on how to make them better.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I would like to think about the design of the early stages of the project.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of early stage is that early stage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, and I want to help them get on track well.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The chat system asks in-depth questions in response to keywords, but in extreme cases, for example, there are people who enter sentences with no keywords at all. In such cases, of course, there are no keywords, so it is impossible to ask a proper question.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, I want to help them get on track well.
- Where is this early stage?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Especially the first time you use it, I recommend looking at the log, but you start it up without looking at it and put "what do you want to happen?" and then you start up without looking at the log and put "Nothing" in the "What do you want to happen? Well, aside from such extreme cases, even people who have read the logs to some extent sometimes use NGKW too much and run out of keywords.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, I want to help them get on track well.
- How do you know these early stages?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>(Why such a focus on the early stages?)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>As for how to know that the early stages are not going well, perhaps you can compare the logs that are going well with those that are not and see if there is a significant difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and then you can determine that.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where is the beginning of this process?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's already there, but it's like launching a rocket, you have to get a certain speed or you'll crash.

I'm not in the business of creating training data for a keyword extraction engine, but using this chat system is supposed to help me reach awareness (month), but I'm acting counterproductive.

- Where is this keyword?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I've found a few keywords that are obviously no good, about 110 when I search the logs with NGKW. Some of them are not no-no's from my point of view, but some of them are no-no's like "つ"
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where are those keywords located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>They are scattered in the data file and can be collected by writing a tally script.

- How do you know these keywords?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Things that are subject to NGKW commands. The rest may be candidates even if they are not explicitly commanded, but their scores are not increasing.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>A failure to extract keywords, which was cut out in an odd way.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of keyword extraction is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is rather good for some long sentences, but for short words, it tries to force extraction from them and sometimes extracts strange things. The goodness of the keywords found is normalized to a maximum of 100 points, so if the input is such that only one garbage keyword is found, it will be a garbage keyword with 100 points.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It is important to be able to extract good keywords
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these keywords come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Should we just lower the score when the user's input is short or something? Not necessarily, I guess...sometimes you have to put in a perfect keyword in one word. I still have to machine learn how good the keywords are.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What should those keywords happen to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Bad keywords, even if they are extracted, should score low.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to those keywords for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We just need to determine that the keyword is bad.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Can that keyword do it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You can do that by putting together that kind of machine learning.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of machine learning is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We can use a binary classification to learn whether NG or not, and use the probability values as coefficients.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> I would like to think about [Naturalness determination of questions
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of judgment is that judgment?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Determine if the combination of keywords and questions is natural based on training data
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of question is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Some questions given
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that question?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I think there's a funny kind of word to put in there, obviously, like "what happens when ~?"
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of word is the word?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wondered if I could make a decision from the data without considering that, but it doesn't seem to be working out so well, so I guess I should think about what I would do if I were rule-based and devise a feature set.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to think about movement extraction.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of extraction is that?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>When we say keyword extraction, the world often extracts noun phrases. It's the same with keywords in papers and so on. But when I think about using them in this chat, verbs are often accompanied by more concrete images than nouns, and are too good to throw away.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of noun is it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>If you extract the noun, it would look like this. With verbs, it would be "What kind of 'use' is that 'use'?" And so on. It's a question, isn't it?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that noun?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Nouns often tend to be abstract concepts, and when asked about abstract concepts, they often tend to be even more abstract, which is not very good!
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know that noun?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Morphological analysis will tell you.

- >  Nouns often tend to be abstract concepts, and when asked about abstract concepts, they often tend to be even more abstract, which is not very good!
- Where is this noun located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I'll take out the verbs in the user input and add them to the keywords for now, but some of them, like "say" and "see" are not very good, so I need to filter them out.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of keywords are those?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Also, where do you have the information that it's better to put it in swastikas?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of hook brackets are those hook brackets?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's better to group not only verbs but also words that contain particles, so you can either judge by the display part.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of verb is that verb?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>It's not about "being" or anything, but about the user's active behavior that is important.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What type of user is this user?

[0th chat](https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=JHtIK2CW5uzh543nuKWr)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>We've delved into each of the five tasks so far in individual chats
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>(Internet) chat
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The first is the design of the end, which is intended to have the value of "it feels good to end nicely." Specifically, "allow questions to produce answer choices," "ask the question, "Is this a good place to end, rule-based," "if yes, delete the input field," and "yes, If yes, then delete the input field, and if no, then use the information for machine learning in the future.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>options
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Second is the design of the early stage, which is to "have many users experience that by using this chat system, they can get language and awareness of their blind spots," and to solve the problem of not getting off track in the early stage for this purpose.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>the opening(s) (e.g. in a game of go or chess)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>He wrote that he can detect the slow rate of keyword increase, but does not know what to do about it. Is it better to visualize it? A rocket launch metaphor, a percentage indication of how far the value to be achieved in each phase has been achieved?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>metaphor
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The third is the ability to play bad keywords. The value is to be able to extract good keywords. This is machine learning of good and bad keywords.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>machine learning
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The fourth is the naturalness determination of the question, which has not yet reached the value question. Specifically, I am thinking that I should devise a feature to do this in a rule-based manner.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>value
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The fifth is motion extraction, which is also not a value question. It is easy enough to just extract verbs, but not everything, so a filter must be applied.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>value
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>And well, after thinking this far, I decided that the first of the five should be movement extraction. Because it will have a positive impact on the way the early stages of the project will proceed by increasing the number of keywords extracted. Next is a mechanism to play the keywords that are not good. This improves the quality of keywords and reduces the likelihood of stumbling in the early stages.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>the opening(s) (e.g. in a game of go or chess)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The early design does not have a clear language of action. It would be a good idea to try to verbalize it again after the first two are done. And if you come up with one, implement it, and if not, proceed to the end design.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>the opening(s) (e.g. in a game of go or chess)
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Improvements to the naturalness determination of the questions are pending, but I'm okay with putting it off until later because the training data is growing just by leaving it alone.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>question
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>the end
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I wanted the tasks to be organized, but I got what I needed to do first and next, so the objective was achieved.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nisbot/icon' alt='nisbot.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that task?
