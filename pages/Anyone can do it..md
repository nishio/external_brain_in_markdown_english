title: "Anyone can do it."
---

To be told, "Anyone can do it."
- What anyone can really do
- Something that really anyone can do, but no one does because it's considered "without merit".
- The thing that people think "anyone can do it, but there is no advantage" and no one does it, but when they try it, it is surprisingly difficult and they say "there is no way anyone can do it".
Mixed with others such as

- [[anyone]]
- [[be made]]
