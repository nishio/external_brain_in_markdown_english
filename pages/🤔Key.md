    - (As far as assigning keys... ðŸ¤”)

ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

The principle is simple: the keymap is set to send out nenexa for that key, and the dictionary converts "nenea" to ðŸ¤”.
Depending on the sequence of hiragana, there seems to be a difference in whether or not they are automatically converted by Live Conversion, the conditions of which are not yet clear.
The "eeeeee" does not convert, but the "nee x" form does. I had been using "ne-ne-ne" to produce a three-point dash, so I applied that.
