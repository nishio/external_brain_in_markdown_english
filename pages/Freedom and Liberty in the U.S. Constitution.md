<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the context of the U.S. Constitution, there are specific nuances in the use of "[[Freedom]]" and "[[Liberty]]."

- Liberty is a word frequently used in the [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the Constitution to mean, among other things, [[protection from undue interference]] by the government or others. It emphasizes [[social compact]] liberty, which guarantees the right of individuals and citizens to live [[autonomously]] by limiting the power of government. Thus, "liberty" has a strong aspect of securing legal and political rights.

- Freedom is an expression often found in the Bill of Rights that refers to an individual's internal "freedom of choice" or willful "freedom of action," such as [[free speech]] or [[freedom of religion]]. The implication here is that in addition to freedom from specific government restrictions, individuals are guaranteed the right to act on the basis of their thoughts and beliefs.

In short, in the context of the U.S. Constitution, "Liberty" refers to "civil liberties" protected through the protection of a governmental or legal framework, while "Freedom" focuses on an individual's inner freedom of belief and choice.
