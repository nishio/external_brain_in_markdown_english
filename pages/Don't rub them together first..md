Too much [[bouncing of ideas, opinions, etc. off each other to obtain a fine-tuned integrated whole]] with the old system too early and it won't be new
It's just a [[slight modification]] of the old system.
[[Search area is narrow]].
- When [[Resource gushing points]] may have moved significantly, do not look in the vicinity of where the resource used to be.
The odds of it being there are not high, but there are a lot of people looking there [[and the competition is bad]].
