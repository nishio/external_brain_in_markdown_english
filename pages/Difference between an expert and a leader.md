title: "Difference between an expert and a leader"
---

- A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.
    - If one is not prepared to make a solitary decision at a "critical moment," he or she is not a leader.
- The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.
    - The leader's job is to lead the group from where they are now to where they have never been.
- It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.
    - The responsibility of an expert is to demonstrate his or her capabilities in a field with which he or she is familiar, and the role of a leader is to push the boundaries of his or her experience.
