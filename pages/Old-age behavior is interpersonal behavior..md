Old-age behavior is interpersonal behavior.

Is senile behavior interpersonal behavior?
- Can I say that [[acting like an old man]] is [[interpersonal behaviour]]?
- Sounds good, but I'm not convinced yet.
- Because it's not interpersonal behavior, i.e., if you're doing it alone, you're not "harming" anyone else.
- No, not really.
- He may not intend interpersonal behavior.
- The person is acting against the world, and the action may harm another person contrary to the person's intentions.
- For example, feeding pigeons.
    - He thinks he is doing something good.
    - This causes the neighbors to suffer from pigeon poop damage.
- But this doesn't sound like much of an old man.
- If you tell them, "I have a problem with poo," and they don't change their behavior, you sound like an old man.
- I knew it was [[personal]] behavior in this instance.
