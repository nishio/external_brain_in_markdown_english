title: "Consistency of decision criteria"
---

- [[consistency]] of [[evaluation criteria]]
One person said, "
- In the past, I decided that B should be preferred over A with [[evaluation criteria]] as X. Now, I have decided that B should be preferred over A with [[evaluation criteria]] as X.
- Now, if X is the criterion, then D should take precedence over C, but it seems to me that C should take precedence.
- But there is no [[consistency]]. I don't know if this is the right thing to do.
I was struggling with the idea.

Good.

It was a mistake to verbalize "X is the criterion" in T1 during the previous decision-making process.
- They were unaware that there was another axis, Y.
- He finally realized this when he saw a case where the difference in X was not so great and the difference in Y was large.

It is important to realize the mistake.
- Mistakes should be corrected.
    - [[err and not change one's ways, this is what it is to err]]

- [[Mistakes in decision-making]] and [[Mistakes in the language of decision-making methods]] are two different things.
    - [[Rules of unknown value should be discarded.]]

- [[Mistakes in the language of methods]]
- [[Linguistic Mistakes]]
- [[decision-making]]
- [[Language of Methods]]   [[Language of Methodology]]
