There are people who make appeals like "I have 30 years of X experience" regarding X in arts and sports.

- People who have studied [[Lean Startup]] see this and think, "Whoa, typical [[Vanity Indicators]].
- Like the "[[total number of users]]" of a service, it is a value that increases by itself over time, so it is inappropriate as a measure of how good or bad something is.

After a certain point, gamers are like, "What's the level?" "What about achievements?" and "What are the achievements?
- It does not look at the time since the game was purchased or the total play time, but rather the levels reached, items owned, "achievements" (deactivated achievements), and other (unique, not defined as achievements) "things accomplished" by the game.
    - [[Parable of playing time and experience]]

- [[One symptom of aging]]
