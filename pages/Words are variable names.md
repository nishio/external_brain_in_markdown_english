title: "Words are variable names"

    - [[variable name]] points to an entity in memory
    - [[term]] points to an entity in the same way.
    - For lack of a better word for this "entity," I'll call it a "concept," which is somewhat incongruous.
- An entity can be a function definition, a class, or an instance of a class.
- On the human side, entities are abstract concepts and concrete experiences.
    - I guess the discomfort is this: it doesn't feel right to call the experience a "concept".
- Both entities are intricately interlinked.
    - So it's difficult to cut it out and tell others.
- Variable names are just labels for entities, so multiple names may be attached to the same entity.
- The same variable name may point to different entities.
- What is pointed to may vary depending on timing.
    - Short variables are temporary
    - Global variables have longer names.
        - To reduce collisions
