Weibo
- I thought I created a Weibo account before, but I can't log in.
    - Did the account disappear because it was created and left unattended for a long period of time?
    - I made a new one: [https://weibo.com/u/7277520899](https://weibo.com/u/7277520899)
    - I couldn't figure out how to log in from a PC, but the PC side gives out a QR code, which is then scanned by the app.

- Weibo Interesting
    - When you open the app, the first thing you see is a full-page ad.
    - I followed various accounts and got instant DMs.
        - There would be an automatic message back feature when following up.
        - They have it on line.
    - When you RT without a message, it will be clearly marked as "Repost".
