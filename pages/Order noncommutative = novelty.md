- Limited to the interior of S, there is no link between A and D.
- If not limited, links lead through B and C outside of S
- If A and B or C and D are synonyms, make them the same point in advance or just connect the links.
    - If it is the same point, the path will not change depending on whether it is cut at S or not
    - Whether this suppression of change is a good thing depends on the circumstances.
        - One could interpret "eliminating noncommutativity" = "preventing new discoveries through changes in perspective."

relevance
- This figure is almost the same as the one in "[[analogy]]".

Roger. Order noncommutative = novelty, chewed up with "boundary operation𝔅" and "quotient (aka bundling) operation𝔔".

core
- Treat the operation as an "injection" = treat it as a function that changes the "way data looks".
- Noncommutative = Same two operations but different order will change the result
- Curvature 𝒦 := 𝔅𝔔 - 𝔔𝔅 = the "remainder of the order difference" expressed as a formula
- Novelty = created where 𝒦 is non-zero (results shifted in order)

Intuitive diagram (even if)
Consider two operations: "cut the map by a range" = 𝔅 (display only Tokyo) and "bundle aliases" = 𝔔 ("Metropolitan Government/Tokyo Metropolitan Government/Tocho" in the same bundle).
- Bundle first -> cut the range later (𝔅𝔔)
Leave only the metropolitan area after one alias for the same building.
- Cut the range first → bundle it later (𝔔𝔅)
After narrowing down the list to only Tokyo, bundle the remaining labels.
Difference: Aliases that appear only "outside" the metropolitan area will disappear if 𝔅 is performed first, so they cannot join the bundle.
→ The nodes that remain and the way they are connected change depending on the two ways.
→ This is the intuition behind 𝒦 = 𝔅𝔔 - 𝔔𝔅 ≠ 0 (the output is displaced in the order).

Minimal example (shortest route changes)
Nodes: A="Garoon", B="Group", C="Gr", D="Garoon".
Edge: Contextual link (A-D Identical paraphrase, B-C Similar, A-B Distant)
- 𝔔 (aka bundle): "Garoon/Garoon/Gr (internal context)" into one bundle → A, C, D merge and distance from B shortens.
- 𝔅 (boundary): cut to "internal context only" → "group (general term)" B disappears, A-B distance becomes irrelevant.
Order Difference:.
1. 𝔅𝔔: bundle first → leave only in-house later
- The shortest path from A-B is "A(bundle) ↔ C(internal abbreviation) ↔ ...", which is short.
2. 𝔔𝔅: leave only in-house first → bundle later
- B (general term) is cut off and the pathway itself is lost or lengthened.
=> shortest path (invariant) changes in order = new connections and disconnections = novelty.
The amount of this misalignment is the magnitude of the curvature 𝒦.

Why "Order Difference = Source of Novelty"?
- If it is commutative (the same if the order is swapped), the structure is preserved no matter how the display is changed = newness is difficult to achieve.
- If it is noncommutative (output changes in order), then joins, breaks, and shortest path changes occur that only appear in either order.
→ There, "a path that has not been seen before" and "another cohesion" will emerge.
→ It can be defined as novelty.

A Word on Formality
$\mathcal{K} = \mathfrak{B},\mathfrak{Q} - \mathfrak{Q},\mathfrak{B}$
- 𝒦=0: Same if reordered (commutative) → Hard to establish novelty
- 𝒦≠0: the result is displaced in the order (noncommutative) → the difference is novelty

Replacement into practice (very short)
- First bundle (𝔔) and then cut (𝔅), and the difference in nomenclature becomes a bridge.
- If you cut (𝔅) first and then bundle (𝔔), the bridge candidate will fall off and become invisible.
- If you do both of the two orders and compare the differences, the connections you missed will float.
→ Difference = 𝒦 "hot spot" = discovery point.
