IterativeCommenter Name Consultation

Implementation changes: 1.
- When reading and commenting with URL specification, it is more natural to write below
- If you try to write it down below, you'll need to change the previous note's acquisition as well.
    - How should it be?
    - I was envisioning a design with the beginning as a summary and the bottom as a conversation space, but then the input wouldn't change unless a human updates the top summary.
        - Well, the fragments you see in [[page memory]] change, or other new fragments are added and you pick them up, so what's the point?
        - Instead of going off on a tangent like the original [[Recurrent Notes]], it stays around the summary at the beginning and gradually explores outward.
        - That sounds like it would be beneficial.
        - Explore the surrounding area from camp and move camp when you find something useful

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>I used to create a repetitive system where AI would write note A, read A the next day and write B. I called it recurrent_notes. With a slight modification, AI now reads the beginning of a page and adds a comment at the end of the page. At this time, a human summary is placed at the beginning of the page, and the AI's output is no longer available for the next reading without human intervention. What would be an appropriate name for this system?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Regarding the new, modified system, based on the "recurrent_notes" principle, where the AI reads the beginning of the page and adds comments at the end of the page, the following suggestions are possible when it comes to names:
- [Iterative Commenter: This name is a combination of the word "iterative" and "commenter," which refers to the action of adding a comment.
- PageTailor: The name is a combination of "tailor" (to tailor, customize), referring to the ability to add comments at the "end" of a page.
- SummaryResponder: Since the AI comments based on the "summary" at the beginning of the page, this is the name to describe it.
- [NoteReflector: The name incorporates the concept of "reflect" in that it generates new comments and responses based on existing content.
- FeedbackLoopNotes: The name incorporates the idea of a repetitive feedback loop and also feels related to the original "recurrent_notes".
Ultimately, it is best to choose a name that you feel is most appropriate, taking into account the purpose, characteristics, and usage scenario of the system.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>IterativeCommenter feels like it describes the behavior naively; NoteReflector is cool, but is it hard to convey the nuance of Reflect's contemplation?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Certainly, the choice of name can have different impressions depending on the nature and purpose of the system and its target user base and cultural background. The nuances and connotations of the words and phrases in the name are also important.
IterativeCommenter" is a functional and easy-to-understand name because it directly reflects the behavior of the system. On the other hand, "NoteReflector" is a bit abstract and may not fully convey the nuances of "reflect," which means contemplation or deep reflection.

In light of this, the following names are also possible
- NoteAugmenter: has the connotation of augmenting information by adding comments based on the original content.
- PageAmplifier: implies to enhance and amplify the content of a page.
- ContentEnhancer: a concept that reinforces the value of the overall content with summary-based comments.

Which name is most appropriate depends on the overall concept and branding of the system and the needs and expectations of the target user base. Based on the above suggestions, we may further refine the idea.
