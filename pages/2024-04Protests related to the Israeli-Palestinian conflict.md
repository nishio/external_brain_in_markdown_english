In April 2024, several universities in the United States experienced large-scale protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At [[Columbia University]], for example, a protest camp called the "Gaza Solidarity Camp" was set up to demand university and political changes. The movement spread to other universities, with similar camps and demonstrations at MIT, Tufts University, Emerson College, the University of Michigan, New York University, and Yale University.

University responses to these protests have been mixed, with the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan bringing in police to manage the protests and protesters being arrested on several occasions. At UMass, for example, 56 students were arrested during a sit-in demonstration, a more severe response than in previous incidents.

In addition, anti-Semitism has been raised as an issue at some events, which has caused further tensions. In response, the mayor of New York City and President Joe Biden have also issued statements stressing the importance of maintaining a respectful environment on campus and the importance of free speech.

These protests reflect broader social debates on American University campuses and reactions in the United States to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They have also sparked debates about free speech and campus order, the role of universities in political debates, and the impact of campus activities on U.S. foreign policy and community relations.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>
Pro-Israel Side Arguments
- NEED FOR SECURITY: Israel claims the right to defend its citizens against terrorism and rocket attacks. Supporters of Israel often stress its actions as national self-defense.
- State Legitimacy: Israel's founding was based on international law and UN resolutions, and it asserts its right to exist.
- Fighting Anti-Semitism: points out that anti-Israel sentiment on campus can lead to anti-Semitism and calls for security for Jewish students.
- Promoting peaceful solutions: some advocates stress the importance of negotiations for peaceful solutions, arguing that dialogue should take precedence over violent protests.

Pro-Palestinian arguments
- Opposition to Human Rights Violations: We call for the unjust treatment and human rights violations against the Palestinian people and call for intervention by the international community.
- END OF OCCUPATION AND COLONIALISM: We demand an end to Israeli occupation and colonialist policies and support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.
- Education and Freedom of Expression: emphasizes protecting freedom of expression at universities and insists that political opinions should be freely expressed in academic settings.
- Respect for International Law and Justice: We call for action based on international law and the realization of justice for the Palestinian people.

These arguments are developed in a broader social and political context than just protests on college campuses. The arguments from each side are based on deep-rooted historical backgrounds and complex international relations, and it is important to understand both perspectives.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the two sides have differing interpretations of the facts on the following points

1. state sovereignty and right to exist
- Pro-Israel: Israel's right to exist is non-negotiable and is based on the 1947 UN Partition Resolution, among other things. This resolution proposed the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state in the former British Mandate of Palestine.
- Pro-Palestinian: Palestinians also claim the right to self-determination and an independent state under the same UN resolutions, but criticize Israeli occupation and expanding settlement policies as preventing this.
2. security and violence
- Pro-Israel: Military action in Gaza and the West Bank is considered a necessary defense against terrorist and rocket attacks from Hamas and others.
- Pro-Palestinian: Criticizes the same military action as a disproportionate use of force and aggression, resulting in many civilian casualties and collective punishment.
3. settlements and land rights
- Pro-Israel: Some see the settlements as legitimate because of historical and biblical ties, and also justified by security needs.
- Pro-Palestinian: The international community and Palestinian supporters generally view the settlements as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace.
4. historical narratives
- Pro-Israel: emphasizes the Jewish people's long history and ties to the land and the need for the state to be a refuge from persecution.
- Pro-Palestinian: emphasizes the continued presence of Palestinian Arabs and their expulsion (Nakba) after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
5. human rights and international law
- Pro-Israel: Israel abides by international law and often criticizes international organizations for being biased against Israel.
- Pro-Palestinian: asserts that Israeli policies, particularly the blockade, settlement expansion, and military occupation, are contrary to international law and human rights standards.

These differences in interpretation contribute to prolonged disputes because both sides rely on different legal, historical, and moral arguments.
