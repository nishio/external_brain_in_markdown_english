[[translation system that translates while maintaining knowledge network connectivity]].

- I finally verbalized what I wanted to do.
    - I want to translate while preserving the Wiki's link structure."
    - Scrapbox has great value in the links, not in the text itself written there, and a simple translation would destroy that.

        - This is related to the [iceberg model
- from [/villagepump/2023/12/18](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/2023/12/18)
    - Hmmm, getting GPT 3.5 to translate while maintaining link connectivity, how hard can that be?
        - I'm starting to think it would be easier to detect that it's out of order and add it.
        - Once you've had lunch and read the implementation of blu3mo or...
    - Walking into the convenience store got me thinking.
        - What we want to accomplish is "translation that preserves the linkage connection."
        - I find the internal links in Scrapbox very useful, but a simple translation would cut it off.
        - If you want to keep the connection "secure", shouldn't that be ensured by the program, not the LLM?
    - I wrote code to ensure linkage connections.
        - Style of adding broken links
        - But Scrapbox can't tell if it's a red link or not just from the exported JSON, which forces it to add and connect whether it's a red link or not.
        - How about that?
- I think I could do it, but it would be full of errors to run the whole thing out of the blue for verification, and yet "whether the link is connected" is an attribute that can be determined after the whole conversion is done, so what should I do with the next action?
- I thought about it while washing dishes, but it seems like a good route to output the scaffold network first and then flesh it out.

- That said, I'll do a translation review.
- Sort by the number of times each link appears and view the top

- I got a difficult one from the very beginning.
    - Well, it makes sense.
    - DeepL translates as `The Intellectual Production of Engineers
        - [[Overloading the "no's" of the engineer's intellectual production techniques]]
        - Self-consciously overloading multiple concepts.
    - [[About title]]
        - You're writing.
- Is "let the chaos speak for itself" Allow?
    - Enable or Let?
    - If you consider something like that, you could have a new page for every line.
- There's a simple one.
    - Mere fact, Mr. Tachikawa is "Tatekawa".
        - I fixed this.
        - I fixed several places by searching for "tachikawa."
            - Tachikawa Danshi was also there, so we can't just fix it all at once.
    - MITOU for unexplored, MITOU Foundation for unexplored
        - I'll have to search for this one and fix it all.
            - That's 97...
        - Often translated as Unexplored / Undiscovered
        - The unexplored nature of...
            - Let's keep it MITOU-SEI.
            - Maybe it's MITOU-ness.
            - [[Unexplored lands are invisible to those who do not walk]]
            - What is this "unexplored land"?
            - This would be `unexplored land`.
            - A sense of "entangling" the word "unexplored."
                - It makes sense to separate it from unexplored projects.
        - Hashtag Accident: `#Unexplored Conference`.
            - Delete this
        - `If there are other people's footprints in the direction you're going, it's not [[an untraveled path]].
            - Uh, I guess this is an UNTRODDEN PATH.
- What's "blue"?
    - Oh, I'm getting a lot of hits within the Lego order sheet.
    - We should count the number of pages they appear on, not the number of times they appear.
