title: "Use light talk"

from [[The Art of Worldly Wisdom]]
Use slips.

This "slip" is a "witty word" or a "light word".
lxxiii

That is how wise people get out of difficult situations. They escape from the most intricate labyrinths with a witty remark. They get out of the most serious disputes with a lighthearted remark or a smile. Most great leaders are skilled in this art. If you must refuse, it is often polite to talk about something else. Sometimes, not understanding is the best proof of understanding.
