- Corsair is a persistent card, making you discard the first silver or gold coin you spend.
    - I've chosen the approach of acquiring silver coins with a trader.
    - There are many cards that yield virtual coins, so I thought later that I would have preferred that one.
        - Especially with vassals.
            - More silver in the trader reduces the probability of a chain of actions.

- I've done it about 3 times, running off with 5 gold, getting a horse, and then banishing that horse as a bounty hunter to get +3 gold.
- He was complaining that there was nothing to increase purchases even though the family of inventions was driving prices down, but if you want to broaden the term to "purchases and acquisitions," then the butcher shop would fall into that category.
    - I realized it a little too late.
    - Finally, we're down to two gold coins, so we can turn the copper coins into gold at the butcher's.

- It was 5-2, so the perfume - guardian
    - Another person with the same choice was expected to thin the deck.

There is an excess of draws.
Only village-owned green space for more action.
- There's also the village option.

- I realized too late, when the Torturer's discard effect discards a village-owned green space, it can trigger the main effect, which mitigates the Torturer's disadvantage. I should have bought it earlier.
