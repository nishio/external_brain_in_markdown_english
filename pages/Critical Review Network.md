As a choice of translation
Not sure if "critical" or "key" is better.

[[關鍵評論網絡]] from [[Polis 2.0: forging ahead with a critical review]].

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/claude/icon' alt='claude.icon' height="19.5"/>The Critical Review Network is described in the original text as follows

- > Transparent polis and talk to the city are two of the most important factors that can be seen in a circular process:
- > I. The accumulation of time is a kind of "rigidity", which makes people conscious of the history of the past and the future. I am aware that the modern civilization, which is so slow in maintaining time, is more humble in the process of warring against each other, and less concerned with the outcome.
- > I am aware that the position of the equipment is a distinction, but we can be in a position to influence many interests in the real world and take on unequal positions. 若說LARP（臨場動態角色扮演遊戲，Live Action Role Playing）幫助參與者換位思考與強化各種立場的回饋，那在 Talk to the City，那在 Talk to the City，是有機會創造出虛擬人機協作的 LARP劇本的。 The April LLM RPG training paper (Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior) by Shitanbashi University and Google researchers shows the potential for AI to adapt itself to the lives of AI residents, and to interact with them in a public sphere.

Translation and commentary:
- > Polis and Talk to the City feedback loops have two obvious advantages:
- > The catalyst for differing opinions: the accumulation of positions over time creates a high-dimensional state of "rigidity" and makes humanity aware that the history of repetition of differing opinions is repeating itself. Optimistically, I hope this will lead modern citizens, whose dimension of time moves so slowly, to be more humble about the process of debate rather than obsessing over the outcome.
- > Personification of positions: the review network created from these key statements will be an anthropomorphic LLM. I optimistically believe that diverse real-world stakeholders can be easily fitted into different positions, albeit positions differentiated by machines; if LARPs (live action role-playing games) can help participants change and strengthen their positions, Talk to the City, there is an opportunity to create virtual human-machine collaborative LARP scripts. An LLM RPG training paper published in April by researchers at Stanford University and Google ([[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior]]) suggests the potential for adaptation of AI residents and digital public interaction in digital public spaces will be an important development topic.

It is stated here that the feedback loop between Polis and Talk to the City creates two benefits: catalyzing different opinions and personifying positions.
The catalyst for differing opinions explains that positions accumulated over time create a high level of "rigidity" that encourages people to be humble in the discussion process.
In personification of positions, it is stated that the review network created from the key statements becomes an anthropomorphic LLM. It is explained that this facilitates the application of diverse real-world stakeholders to different positions and creates opportunities to create virtual human-machine collaborative LARP scripts.
Research on LLM RPG training suggests the potential for adaptation of AI residents, and it is noted that interaction in the digital public space will be an important development topic.
These are the descriptions and explanations of the Critical Review Network in the original text.
