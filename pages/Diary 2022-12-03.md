I think the most serious feature is that "the output of image generation AI has digital watermarks so that future AI will not use it for training data", "it is expected that people will use text creation AI to create explanatory blogs", "text is more easily modified and reconstructed than pictures, so it is difficult to tell if it is AI-generated or not".

And readers who can't discern the bullshit now, of course can't discern it either.

I dislike "writing commentary" regardless of whether it's AI-generated or not, but since it's 100 times easier to do it and there's an incentive for those who have been doing it to expand, I doubt that saying I dislike it will stop society from moving forward.

Information Civil Attack]. I think that ultimately it becomes a question of how to seek "collateral". This may actually be the same problem that blockchain has tackled as proof of OO.

I recall that the C14 dating had to be corrected due to changes in atmospheric C14 concentrations caused by fossil fuel combustion and nuclear testing.
