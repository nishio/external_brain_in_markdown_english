Judgments supported by [[Multiple perspectives]] of [different ranges of observation
    - Derivative content from [We cannot know the totality of what others know.

If Mr. A says that he prefers Option X based on his [[Observation range]] information
- Mr. B doesn't think option X is a good idea based on his observations.
- In this case, Mr. B will not adopt Mr. A's proposal X
- If Mr. A really believes that incorporating option X will benefit B, it is better to share with B the information that will provide the basis for believing so.
    - [[Share the decision-making process, not the results of the decision]].
            - [Good decisions are supported by many facts.
- Since A does not do so, B decides that A is just saying that without any particular basis.
- This could be [[a symmetrical relationship]].

    - Both parties believe the other's judgment is not well-founded.
    - B also asked A, "Why do you think that's a good idea?" It is more productive to ask
        - Don't wait for A to give it to you first, just go get it.
        - Well, there are a myriad of people, so I thought it would be reasonable to give preference to those who seem to be able to converse productively, rather than those who are strongly advocating for it.
