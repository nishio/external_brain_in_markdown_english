Larger [[context window]] to maintain [long-term project context

The following is a discussion of how the larger context window allows us to maintain the context of a long-term project.

Importance of context windows in long-term projects
In longer conversations and projects, larger context windows make it easier to maintain consistent context. For example, an AI with a longer context, such as Claude, can generate appropriate responses based on the flow of the conversation while keeping the project objectives in mind. This allows for convergence toward the project's objectives, preventing derailment of the conversation while allowing for consistent progression.

Examples of actual use
In fact, the size of the context window plays an important role in long-term project management. For example, when managing a project in Scrapbox, the process of detailing is a process that maintains the context of a long-term task management or private project. This allows you to write down your thoughts and put them to bed, and then revisit and detail them over time.

This larger context window facilitates the maintenance of long-term project context and effective project management.
