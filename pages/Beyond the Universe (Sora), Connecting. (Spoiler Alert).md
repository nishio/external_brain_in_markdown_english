Spoiler Explanation
- Although it looks exactly like Homo sapiens, this alien has genitalia in its hands, and exposing its hands in public is an immoral act.
- What a handshake is to Homo sapiens appears to be an act of reproduction to these aliens.
    - On Earth, an act of friendship -> You have sex to show friendship!　would be an act of friendship
            - [[bonobo (Pan paniscus)]] and all that.
- Aliens come to visit and trade with us for a handshake.
    - On Earth, they walk around with their hands exposed and openly shake hands.
    - = From the alien perspective, it becomes "walking around with exposed genitals and openly engaging in sexual activity."
- It was a big deal when the handshake revealed that earthlings could conceive an alien child.
