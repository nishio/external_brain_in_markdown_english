Choose the best method for your objectives and abilities, understand the extent to which you can make changes, and act accordingly
    - [[As objectives change, appropriate methods change.]]
    - [[We don't think about the things we can't change.]]
    - [[Turn what you want to do into what you can do.]]
    - [[Not "don't want to change," but "don't want to be changed."]]

### Digest of Research Notes
.

My last research note was on the subject of "changing as much as you can". This concept refers to the idea of recognizing the extent to which you can change and acting accordingly, based on your abilities and environment.

Some of Nishio's research notes, such as "If the purpose changes, the appropriate method changes," "Don't think about what you cannot change," "Change what you want to do to what you can do," and "Don't want to be changed" instead of "Don't want to change." are relevant. These complement the idea of choosing the best method for your objectives and abilities, understanding the extent to which you can change, and acting accordingly.

Also, the names of tasks such as "[[What only I can do]]," "[[I can't change it.]]," "[[Two ideas]]," "[The value of my being to myself is higher than anything else I can think of. Complete state," and other fragments are also related to the theme of recognizing one's abilities and value and making the best choices based on that recognition.

Integrating these fragments reveals the idea of understanding one's own abilities and values and making the best choices based on them. This indicates the importance of [[self-recognition]] and [[self-efficacy]], which are key elements in [[self-improvement]] and [[goal achievement]].
