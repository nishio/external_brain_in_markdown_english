title: "Prioritize what you use."
---

I had several ideas on how to proceed with the project, and I had a hard time deciding which one to go with, so I asked GPT4. As a result, an axis of conflict was discovered that I was not aware of.

Some of the options were ones that I considered "likely" to have the users I was seeking, but I myself was not a user.
One option, on the other hand, I was the user and [[beneficiary]]. I have clear needs of my own, not the "likely" needs of the former.
The problem is that there are two types of problems: "I don't know if there is a user, but I am sure I can achieve it," and "I have a user, but I am not sure if I can achieve it.

Then you should prioritize what you use.

- Proposal for how to proceed after this
    - A: Write an article on how to install Omoikane Vecter Search
        - Anyone can do something like this in their own Scrapbox: [[Cases where vector searches were useful]].
    - B: First, create an Omoikane Question Box
        - Omoikane Vecter Search with a question-box-like question-and-answer UI
        - What you get
            - Are there users who prefer it to mere search?
            - Someone wants to ask questions in nishio's Scrapbox (not sure if they really want to).
            - Someone may want to use their Scrapbox as a question box (unknown).
            - The process of virtual character co-management from Mr. Qualia's Question Box.
    - C: More trial and error with the Bot that writes to Scrapbox
        - Bot writes a note in Scrapbox and reads the note on the next run to become a "virtual character that keeps its memory".
        - This will be a unique Scrapbox experience!

- Option A focuses on education and awareness, B on community and dialogue, and C on technological exploration and innovation.
    - A: Useful when there is a lack of good teaching materials or when the emphasis is on disseminating vector searches
    - B: Useful if you want to enhance user interaction or are seeking new means of communication
    - C: Useful if you are looking for a technical challenge or want to provide a new experience utilizing Scrapbox
- I see. Okay.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - A and B think that the user they seek is "likely" to be there, but I myself am not a user.
        - A has been implemented and used long ago, so doing A doesn't increase utility.
        - I honestly don't think I'd use B because I think "search, then cherry-pick, put together in Scrapbox, then ask ChatGPT" has more utility.
            - The utility for me was that "someone asking a question" would allow Ms. Qualia to grow on her own, or provide an opportunity to develop her thinking.
            - However, [[Preparation for Omoikane Study Group]] found that asking ChatGPT a question can increase the linguistic fluency without the uncertain expectation that a human being will do it.
    - C is the beneficiary himself.
        - I've been hesitant because of the uncertainty, but until we see a concrete need for A and B, C should be our priority.
