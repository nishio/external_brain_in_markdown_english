title: "The concept of sharing has changed the animation industry dramatically"
---

> Masumoto: Another thing that has greatly changed the animation industry is the concept of [[share]].
>  In animation production, we need tables to manage various things, and five years ago we basically had individual Excel and Word file data. We were copying that data and passing it on by e-mail, so people who were not given the data had no idea what was going on.
>  By changing this to "sharing Google docs and spreadsheets," we now have a situation where [[everyone]] who has registered their email address can see the latest data at the same time.
>
>  Matsumoto: Accidents are less likely to happen. Since no one will be able to work with the old version.
>
>  Masumoto: That's right. I think it was a great reform that not only direct verbal communication but also various data became available to anyone on demand.
