title: "Different people have different views of the world."
---

from  [[Diary 2023-07-02]]
Different people have different views of the world.
- [[world view]] is different for each person.
- When people with very similar worldviews are all clustered together, it leads to the assumption that there is only one worldview.
- Such people sometimes ostracize "[[people]] with a different worldview."
        - Response of [[an old man in a rural village]] to [traveler's merchant
- If A does not ostracize B, but B ostracizes A, then the two cannot get along.


[[No need to persuade those who can't pay the price.]]
- If travelers want to get something of value from the village, they need to convince others
- If not, no need to persuade.
- Simply leave the village.
