His work has influenced a wide range of fields, including sociology, economics, political science, and religious studies, and he is particularly well known for his "[[Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism]]," which examines the relationship between religious ethics and capitalism.
- Weber focused on understanding social behavior and advocated an approach called "[[understanding sociology]]" (Verstehende Soziologie). He believed it was important to understand how individual behavior, meaning, and values affect social structures and institutions.
- Weber was also concerned with authority and domination and proposed three types of "[[legitimate]] domination." These are traditional domination (authority based on customs and traditions), charismatic domination (authority based on personal charisma or special qualities), and lawful domination (authority based on laws and rules).
- Weber predicted that legal rule would become the dominant authority type in the process of modernization. This was because legal rule was considered "rational" and would produce efficient organizations and institutions. However, he warned that this rationalization could also be an "iron cage," and he feared that people would lose their freedom and become bound by bureaucratic and technical systems.
- Max Weber's work is the foundation of modern sociology and political science, and his theories and approaches are still cited by many scholars today.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>Max Weber is also famous for his theories on bureaucracy. He considered bureaucracy to be the most efficient and rational form of organization and institution in modern society. Weber conducted an in-depth analysis of the characteristics and workings of bureaucracies and proposed an ideal type of bureaucracy. An ideal type is a conceptual framework for analyzing a real phenomenon, and it is assumed that it does not necessarily correspond to reality.
- The ideal type of bureaucracy presented by Weber has the following characteristics
    - Rule-based behavior: Bureaucracies act according to clear rules and laws, eliminating arbitrary decisions.
    - Hierarchical structure: Organizations are structured hierarchically, with higher authorities directing and holding subordinates accountable.
    - Expertise: Each staff member has expertise in a specific job and performs that job.
    - Overall Scope of Work: The bureaucracy as a whole covers a wide range of work to achieve the organization's objectives.
    - Separation of duties and individuals: Duties are separated from individuals, and employees have professional authority and responsibility.
    - Written records: The bureaucracy keeps a written record of work progress and decisions to ensure transparency and traceability.
- Weber argued that such a bureaucracy is an appropriate organizational form for a modern society that pursues rationality and efficiency. However, he also drew attention to the harmful effects of bureaucracies. For example, he said that excessive rationalization of the bureaucracy may restrict people's freedom and creativity, describing this phenomenon as an "iron cage.
