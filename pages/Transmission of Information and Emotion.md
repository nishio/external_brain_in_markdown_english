>  Most of what we talk about with uneducated people is drinking, smoking, gambling, women, and TV shows. It's hell for me to deal with them.

> [akihiro_koyama](https://x.com/akihiro_koyama/status/1825440616131752069) This is typical [[ASD]] thinking. ASD is like "normal people only talk about drinking and gambling! People are not talking about alcohol or gambling. Everyone is exchanging "feelings" of joy and sorrow related to drinking and gambling.
> [akihiro_koyama](https://x.com/akihiro_koyama/status/1825443973856477339) By the way, not everyone is exchanging information related to alcohol gambling, so if you talk about how much you like Russian literature, for example, or "feelings If you talk about "feelings", for example, how much you like Russian literature, you will be accepted with a high probability. The point is not the "choice of topic" but the lack of understanding of the "culture of conversation" is the cause of the problem. Blaming it on the culture of others is basically isolating.

> [jei_222](https://x.com/jei_222/status/1825464961272861055) I remember psychiatrist [[Tamaki Saito]] saying the same thing.
>  He said that communication is not only about "information transfer," but also about the balance between "information transfer" and "emotional transfer," and that even children can do "information transfer" alone.

> [jei_222](https://x.com/jei_222/status/1825574079790829926) This book is "[[Family Traces]]" by Tamaki Saito.
>  It's interesting and you should read it.

> [jei_222](https://x.com/jei_222/status/1825776245998801365) As a supplement, he says the following regarding communication within the above book.
> >Communication is about sharing context. Communication that attempts to convey only information is often significantly less communicative (continued)
> [jei_222](https://x.com/jei_222/status/1825776698652303645) Conversely, [[communication that only shares context]] can have the illusion that something has been communicated when in fact nothing has been communicated.
>
>  Mr. Hiroki Azuma has mentioned in the past how important contextualization is in dialogue.

> [akihiro_koyama](https://x.com/akihiro_koyama/status/1825464961272861055) Well, to put it harshly, those who refuse to communicate by saying "They are uneducated! I think that people who refuse to communicate with others are at the same level of development as "children who know things". They are not smart, but rather the opposite. It is the opposite of being smart.
> [akihiro_koyama](https://x.com/akihiro_koyama/status/1825471410153861387) "Uncle, do you know Pachycephalosaurus?" You must have encountered some relative's kid who just kept asking you the name of dinosaurs you know, like that, right? I think the communication style hasn't changed from that.

> [piyoketa](https://x.com/piyoketa/status/1825834573114257607) I think there are cases where people with (mild) ASD tendencies, rather than "mistaking communication for information exchange," are "slightly afraid of/not good at communicating with others in general. I think there are cases where people with ASD tendencies have a slight fear or dislike of communication with others in general, but are exceptionally able to communicate positively only in "information-exchange communication" rather than "mistaking communication for information exchange.
> [piyoketa](https://x.com/piyoketa/status/1825834946516365619) You're right that for the average person, communication is not the exchange of information, but then if you make them quit exchanging information, "proper communication (rather, it will lead to giving up communication with others in general).
> [piyoketa](https://x.com/piyoketa/status/1825835926976868444) karaoke for you is information exchange for us, thanks!
> [piyoketa](https://x.com/piyoketa/status/1825839242993611105) In other words, there is a case that "[[in my culture, information-exchange communication is considered more enjoyable than emotional exchange]], so I assume everyone else is the same. Therefore, the view that "people with ASD tendencies communicate in an informative way because they are unable to consider the feelings of others" is one-sided.

I thought "[[In my culture,]] information-exchange communication is considered more enjoyable than emotional exchange" was a very good verbalization.
- If you haven't seen them in a while, ask, "What have you been up to lately?" and exchange "newly acquired information".
- Conversations with people who don't learn are not interesting, because they don't [[update information]].
