title: "Productivity Duck Typing"

If the person believes that doing it will increase productivity, and doing it will actually increase productivity, then it's the right [[increased productivity]] approach." #productivity #ducktyping

The object determines what the object can do.

> In those languages, what an object (the value of a variable) can do is determined by the object itself. This means that if an object has all the methods of an interface, the object can be considered a runtime implementation of that interface, even if the class does not implement that interface declaratively.

Conflicting Ideas Class Design Ideas
The object "you" is an instance of the class "human", and the characteristics you have are defined by the definition of the human class.
This way of thinking leads to the direction of inquiry of "what attributes do humans universally possess?" which is the right direction for scientists to take when studying humans as a whole, but is over-specified for you as an individual trying to improve your own personal productivity.
