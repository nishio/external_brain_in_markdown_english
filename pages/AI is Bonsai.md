AI is Bonsai

> [kis](https://twitter.com/kis/status/1691788469167951910) People talk about LLM as if it "became [[natural science]], not engineering" because you can't predict the behavior and have to experiment and observe, It is also like natural science that it takes hours of fine tuning and hours of evaluation of the results, and the only way to do it is to spend time.
