<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  To eliminate [[slander]], it is better to use a system that does not allow humans to communicate directly with each other.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/> Humanity is not mature enough for direct communication.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> If [[communication with AI]] is deemed [[mature]] enough, you can speak directly, and conversely, if you get into an emotional fight, [[the right to direct speech]] will be revoked.
