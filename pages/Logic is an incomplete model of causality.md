title: "Logic is an incomplete model of causality"
---

- [[Bateson.]]
- [[logic]] is an incomplete model of [cause and effect

[[Causal if/then]] includes time, but [[logical if/then]] does not
So trying to describe a system with [[temporal]] [[feedback]] in logic can lead to inconsistencies.

[[Buzzer parable]]
- If there is a contact, the contact will break.
- If P, then it is NOT P

- [[Rational mysticism]]  p.221
