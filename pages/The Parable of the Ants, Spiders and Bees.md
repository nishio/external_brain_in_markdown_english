>  The empiricist [[ant]] simply collects and uses in the manner of the [[ant]]. The rational school is the [[spider]] way, which makes a net out of itself. The [[hive bee]] method, on the other hand, is in the middle, gathering materials from gardens and wild flowers, but deforming [[digestion]] them with their own power.
    - [[Francis Bacon.]] [[Novum Organum.]] Aphorism 95
    - [[empiricism]] and [[continental rationalism]]

Not only must it be collected, it must be transformed and digested.
- What is digestion?
        - [[A book that should be chewed and digested well]] This is also bacon.


- [[ant]]
- [[just collect and use]].
- [[spider]]
