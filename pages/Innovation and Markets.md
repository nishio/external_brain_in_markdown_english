title: "Innovation and Markets"
---

- Both [[innovation]] and [[(the) market (as a concept)]] have fluffy definitions.
- The process of creating something new and having a significant impact on society.
- The process by which something that does not yet exist (0) is created (1) and becomes something that has a significant impact on society (100).

- Of this process, the 0 to 1 process occurs within the individual
        - [[IDEA]] is born in the individual.
- Whether or not the idea will grow into something bigger.
    - It is important to communicate ideas to others
    - Good ideas get the attention of others, get feedback for improvement, and grow see [[How to Create Ideas]].
    - I call this "exposing it to others' evaluations and trying to see if you can get feedback on improvement" "market evaluation".
    - In that sense, the 1 to 100 process happens in the market.
- I call the 0 to 100 process innovation.
    - Some call 0 to 1 innovation.
