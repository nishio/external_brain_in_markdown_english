Summary (brief and to the point only)
- Increase in accidents involving [elderly drivers
    - The number of license holders over 75 years old is increasing, and the accident rate is also rising. Operating errors (e.g., stepping on the gas pedal and brake incorrectly) are prominent.
    - Lumping them all together in [[dementia]] is dangerous.
    - There are stages and types of dementia, and not everyone is a dangerous driver. Some people have juvenile dementia.
- Necessity and reality of return
    - If older drivers return their licenses, they lose mobility and job opportunities. The return rate is low because convenience is a priority.
- Technical Support
    - Technologies such as automatic braking and driving assist are effective, but there are issues such as cost, market size, and handling of personal information (driving data and health information).
- Familiarization through VR, etc.
    - We also propose an initiative to visualize the driving risks posed by dementia and vision loss using VR simulators, etc., to encourage early awareness and decision-making by the individual and his/her family members.
- Community support system
    - Consider a model in which residents help each other (shopping and mobility support), create opportunities for working elderly people to cooperate with each other, etc., and complement each other throughout the community, rather than dismissing elderly people as "not allowed to drive because they are elderly.
- Study of Living Infrastructure and Consolidation
    - Utilize and expand public transportation and logistics services so that people can live without relying on driving. In rural areas, measures such as "consolidation" and "centralization" are also necessary.
- Raising awareness and learning throughout society
    - Spreading understanding of dementia and disabilities through school education and community events to create a society where people complement each other.

In general, the central issue is to balance "ensuring the safety of elderly drivers" and "quality of life," and a multifaceted response is required in terms of technology, systems, and regional cooperation.
