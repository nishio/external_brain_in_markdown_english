A little confused.
- The way it's been written so far, it says something like "what I did last week."
- Last time, as of Friday, I switched ahead of schedule, saying I had a busy weekend.
- You shouldn't be using the phrases "last week" and "this week" if you're not switching to a weekly basis in the first place.

- 3/10  [[Unexplored Conference 2024]]

Plurality
- Regarding Audrey's request for an endorsement of Yukito Karatani, have Audrey describe her relationship with him in the text.
    - I wrote a commentary based on that, and then I had to write it on the cover.
