title: "Distinguish between tasks and TODOs"
---

- [[A "super" introduction to task management to end "To-Do Hell]] distinguishes between tasks and todo.
The term is used in different books at different times, or even mixed up within a single book. (I worry about what my book is about).

- [[task]] : "action that can actually be taken"
- Task list is a list of actions
[[TODO]]: what to do
- Includes schedules and projects
- TODO lists may include things that are not tasks

Wife: "I feel like Task is bigger, Todo is more granular."
- Buying dinner" is a task, and "150 grams of pork" is a todo.
- That's the opposite of the definition in this book.
- A theory that probably depends on what the first tool you used was called.
- On the job, "tasks" are things that fall to you from other people, and TODO is what you bite into the actions you take.
- I agree with you that we need two lists with different granularity.
- I said, "What if it's a list of grainy actions and a list of projects that may contain more than one action?"
- Wife: "The project is a much larger 'housing management project.'"
- Everyone is different in this area in the end, so it seems to me that you should define and use what works best for you.
