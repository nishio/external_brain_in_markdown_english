<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This is a very poetic and abstract statement written in the form of an archaic or poetic text. We offer a poetic interpretation here, but since there is no context or specific reference, interpretations may vary from person to person. The following provides one interpretation.

- Kyoufu Makoto Kawaii / [[Kyoufu is truly lovable]] in
        - [[madness]] or [[stupidity]] says that it is pure, charming, and lovable. This is a reversal of the usual social evaluation.
- Saira is truly something to be feared.
    - On the other hand, the poem regards [[wisdom]] and [[goodness]] as something to be feared. There is a suggestion that they are superficial traits and that danger and deception may lurk behind the scenes.
- A madman is always keen to take on new things.
        - [[madness]] is the impetus toward new discoveries and exploration, he said, and his enthusiasm is keen.
- Fools do not always avoid danger.
    - [[Stupidity]] indicates a propensity to be defenseless or [[not avoiding danger]]. This may seem like a negative trait at first glance, but on the other hand it is also a defenselessness to pursue new possibilities.
- There are many "eccentric" people among the "talented" people.
    - The poem describes talented people as [[sport]] and [[instability]] people. It illustrates the idea that talent brings more [[change]] and instability than [[consistency]] and [[stability]].
- Ryotagohara-zu / Those who are considered [[well-meaning]] are often [[a flunky]].
    - While the "common man" is generally respected, the poem depicts them as methenes [[people who change themselves to please the masses]]. This is one aspect of the poem that calls into question social values.
- [The reputation of the world is often inverted.
    - General perspectives and values are sometimes reversed, which reflects the current state of the world. This points to the ever-changing nature of societies and cultures.
- A man of the past and present is considered extraordinary when you look at him.
    - This phrase asserts that the reversals and fluctuations in values are especially evident when looking at people of the past and present.
- Talented and not talented / Talented people are not really talented and not really talented.
    - Here, we are saying that what is commonly perceived as "sagacity" is not really such a thing. This objection points out that societal definitions and expectations distort individual truths.
- Kyōfugō no 豈 kyōfugō / What is kyōfugō about kyōfugō?
    - Finally, the poem redefines insanity and stupidity. It raises the question of whether it is really "madness" or "stupidity," or whether society has simply labeled it as such.

- From this whole, the poem presents the perspective that seemingly negative traits of insanity and stupidity actually have the power to explore new possibilities, while socially valued talent and goodness can actually obscure or distort individual truths. It also suggests that social values and evaluations are not constant, but constantly changing.
