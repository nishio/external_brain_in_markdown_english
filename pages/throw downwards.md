- I was thinking of sucking up a slide and spitting it out elsewhere, but it looks like you can move it up and down the space by throwing it up and down #sucking it up

- Move the slide that entered within a certain distance of the zenith to the space above.
- Slide thrown above at a certain speed to the space above
