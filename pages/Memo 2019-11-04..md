- There is no such thing as meaning in writing, only the assumption that meaning exists.
- There is no need for a machine to try to understand the meaning of natural language in dealing with it. Because it doesn't exist.
- Anyone who criticizes a machine for not trying to make sense of it is just being delusional and should be ignored.
- Just think about increasing your odds in [[Language Games]] where you are dealing with natural language.
- You don't have to win every game, just the ones that benefit you by winning.
