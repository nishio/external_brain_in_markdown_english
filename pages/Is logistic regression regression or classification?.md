title: "Is logistic regression regression or classification?"
---

- There are arguments like, "[[logistic regression]] is regression," or "No, it's not regression, it's classification."
- It is similar to the discussion of "Are Python and Ruby variables passed by value or by reference to a function?
        - An example of [[choosing the wrong two options]]. In this case, the reference is passed by value.
- Logistic regression solves classification problems by finding probability values in regression.
- Re-posted from a previous article in [Regression and Classification
    - > Misleading point: "logistic regression" is overwhelmingly used for classification problems, not regression problems
    - >  Logistic regression is a method of solving the classification problem of "which group one belongs to" by finding the real value of "probability of belonging to a group" through regression. In other words, it is equivalent to converting a classification problem into a regression problem and then solving it.
