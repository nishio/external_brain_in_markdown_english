Hayashi's Video
> [AtsushiHayashi](https://x.com/AtsushiHayashi/status/1798170392244461860) I usually have a chance to explain what I'm doing, but I can't talk about it due to time constraints and other reasons, and I only talk about 30% of what I want to say. I had a chance to talk about what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and where I'm going, so I'm going to make the archive public (I may delete it soon). I think I said about 70% of what I wanted to say... 1.5 hours...

- I'm too busy doing all kinds of things to put it off when I think I have 90 minutes to do it.
- I'd rather listen to it as background music than try to watch it seriously for 90 minutes.
