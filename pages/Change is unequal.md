title: "Change is unequal"
---

> When people switch from measure A to measure B, they do so because measure B is more beneficial, so saying "make A and B equal" is tantamount to saying "don't change, be stagnant.
>  If this "everyone is equally inefficient" and "[[let's]] avoid change and stagnate together!" will continue to build up resentment, especially among the younger generation, and I think it will eventually explode. People who are now 80 years old may be able to escape from the wave of a major change in values, but I don't think that people who are now 20 years old will be able to escape.
