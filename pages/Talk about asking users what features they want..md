title: "Talk about asking users what features they want."
---

It took me a while to search and find it, so I'll summarize.
    - [[Listen to the problem, not the solution.]]
- Book [[Textbook of Design Research]].
- Discussion [[It's not reasonable to ask users what features they want...]].

- [[What you want]]
- [[People don't know what they want.]]
