title: "Why does pi appear in the sum of the reciprocals of square numbers?"
---

$\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \ldots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ Reason

The sum of the reciprocals of the square numbers [[Pi (3.1415926.)]] The reason why

- Let c be the hypotenuse.
- The area of a triangle can be expressed in two ways
- $a b /2= c h/2$
- $a^2 b^2 = c^2 h^2$
- $a^2 b^2 = (a^2 + b^2) h^2$
- $1 / h^2 = (a^2 + b^2) / a^2 b^2 = a^2 / a^2 b^2 + b^2 / a^2 b^2  = 1 / a^2 + 1 /  b^2$

- When the diameter is d, the circumference is pi d
- Since the circumference is 2, the diameter is 2/pi
- Inverse square, so pi^2 / 4

- 2x diameter, 2x circumference, arc length for 1/2 central angle, so same length

- Explanation of the central angle being 1/2
    - [[Pythagorean theorem]]

- I found that the sum of the odd square numbers is pi^2/8.
- If the sum of the square numbers is S, then the sum of even square numbers is 1/4 S
- The sum of the squares of the cardinal numbers is S - 1/4 S= 3/4 S
- So $S = \frac{\pi^2}{8} \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$
