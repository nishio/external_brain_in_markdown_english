title: "I want to identify stickies from different sources."

- It's a hassle to write the source for everything.
- Do I stamp the identification ID?
- I looked for a small stamp and found one that looked good.

    - 10 things can be identified using it as a number alone.
        - In addition, multiple digits can be expressed by combining left and right.
        - There's only one of each kind, so I can't express it as 11 or something like that.
        - It would suffice as an identifying ID.
    - I bought a small red stamp stand [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2NvayV3).

- Tried.
    - Sticky notes are written first and lined up
    - You can put it on a stamp stand once and pop-pop it on about 4 sticky notes.
    - Much easier than writing marks by hand
