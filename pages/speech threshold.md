A story about a park being closed down because people living near the park complained about the noise of children's voices.
- Lots of people happy to have a park.
    - I think it's [[natural]] and I don't speak up about it.
- People who think kids in the park are too loud.
    - Complain loudly
        - [[noisy minority]]

If each person's [[opinion]] is combined, the park survives.
- However, the "cost of expressing an opinion" is so great that a large number of smaller opinions are not expressed and are considered zero.
- This structure could be improved by technology that lowers [[the cost of expressing opinions]].
- A digital technology-based opinion system can be a means of improvement.

It could be said to lower [[opinion distribution costs]].
- [[Static friction]]

[[bell tolling]]
