    - [[gate]] There is something attractive in G that many people p want to get into.
- So P makes [[column]] and waits for gate G to process.
- There are Q's who don't get in line for that and say, "What's in it for me?"
- I don't [[special treatment]] about Q.
    - Q's perception of what he thinks he can do for you is just a subjective hope, and it's hard to justify giving Q special treatment.
    - Since G's work time is [[Limited resources]], it is appropriate to give priority to P, which is in line for processing.
        - Q has low priority.
    - After the P's are processed, an available G might go to the Q's and talk to them.
        - It is "[[something]] to do if you can afford it."

Compare with "[No need to prioritize people who can't use a phone or computer.
- Differences in the assumed image of the parties involved
    - This is [[willingness not to participate in the procedure]] (will not) / [[who will not]].
        - [We must avoid the confusion of "I can't" and "I won't".
            - →[[I think that]] people who say they can't do something without a clear reason are the ones who won't do it."]
- Difference in meaning of "nothing."
    - B: No special handling, but overall load is reduced by digitization and existing contact points are maintained → resulting in shorter waiting time for non-digital layer (indirect benefit).
    - A: Lower priority is given to requests outside the queue. Processing resources are first directed to P in the queue, and if there is room, to Q as well.
    - → B's "do nothing" = benefit from baseline maintenance + externalities; A's "do nothing" = priority allocation issue.
- justification
    - B: [[Pareto improvement]] (spillover effect of overall efficiency improvement) + [[continuation of existing procedures]] to ensure "not truncation".
    - A: [[Procedural justice]] (fairness on a first-come, first-served, procedural order) + justification for the allocation of limited resources.
- Organizing framework (2 x 2)
    - Ability × Willingness
        - Can x do = digital row (highest priority)
        - Cannot x Do = Analog column (non-digital layer of B: baseline maintenance + indirect benefits)
        - Can do x won't do = Q in A (low priority)
        - Can't do x won't do = Minimal response after identifying factors (system awareness, guidance on alternative measures, etc.)
- Practical and Representational Implications
    - Add a sentence to A: "'Do nothing' means no special treatment; maintain a baseline window, create extra capacity through overall efficiency, and provide assistance as needed."
        - No need to align with the same content, the second half feels too much like B, only the first half should be adopted.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - B's argument can be internalized into A's framework (resource allocation = column priority, and externalities shorten non-digital columns as well).
