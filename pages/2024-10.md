<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/o1 Pro/icon' alt='o1 Pro.icon' height="19.5"/>Major developments in the first half of October and a review (concise version)

[Progress made.
    - [[New UI for Polis]] voting functionality implemented and demonstrated in staging environment
- [[Social Hack Day #64]] and "Can Democracy Really Be Updated?" and other events to gather feedback on the new UI.
- Continued development while concurrently performing daily tasks such as wisdom teeth extraction and sleep rhythm disturbances

[[Being stagnant]].
- Standardization of the data update process in the new Polis UI (a system that is easy for other members to operate has not yet been created).
- Consideration of specific measures to improve sleep rhythms

Awareness and issues
- Reaffirming the need for physical health and metacognitive reflection at a time when the development and implementation of the new UI is beginning to settle down.
- Priority on technical progress tends to put off document maintenance and information sharing within the team.

[Points for the future
- Make the voting function and the data update process on the management side procedural and manual so that anyone can handle it.
- Reflect ideas and feedback from event participation in UI improvements and next feature additions
- Incorporate sleep rhythms and physical health care into daily schedules, in parallel with development and learning
