<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Once, a famous painter was eating at a restaurant. After finishing his meal, he quickly began to draw a picture on a napkin. The owner of the restaurant, who was watching the painting, asked the artist to sell it. The artist replied, "Sure, but I want $100,000 in exchange. The owner was surprised and said, "But it was painted in only 30 seconds! The owner was surprised and said, "But that was painted in only 30 seconds! The artist replied, "No, it was not painted in 30 seconds. The artist replied, "No, it was not painted in 30 seconds, it took me a lifetime to paint it.

This little story symbolizes that the value of a work of art is determined not by the time it took to create, but by the artist's skill, experience, and the entire life behind it. The skill and expressiveness that an artist has honed over the years determines the value of a work of art, even if it was created in a short period of time.
