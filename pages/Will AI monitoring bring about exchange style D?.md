    - [[Introduction to Exchange Styles]]
    - > It was Marcel Mauss, a non-Marxist, who gave a groundbreaking consideration of the social construct of clan society. He considered it not in terms of productive forces or means of production, but in terms of exchange. It is not a commodity exchange, but a reciprocal exchange of gift - return. I call it Mode of Exchange A and distinguish it from commodity exchange (Mode of Exchange C). This exchange is based on three rules: one must give a gift, one must receive a gift, and one must return a gift. This law is not man-made. They are forced by a "curse" ([[how]]) that man is compelled to obey. Social constructs such as clan societies are created by this principle of exchange.
