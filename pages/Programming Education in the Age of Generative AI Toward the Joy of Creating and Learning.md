- [[Kiei Miyajima]]: 26 years old, born in May 1997, Master's degree (Education)
- Founder of [[CoderDojo]] Kashiwa and has taught programming to over 5,000 children through more than 200 events.
- Established Innovation Power and engaged in education-related business
- Currently researching educational methods for digital technology infrastructure at Gakushuin University Graduate School
Part I. Summary of "Recognizing the Zeitgeist":.
- Need to discuss the impact of the AI era on creativity and education
- Advancing AI such as ChatGPT is evolving quickly and posing new questions for the education community.
- Fundamental questions about learning and the raison d'etre of schools need to be reconsidered
Part 2: Summary of "AI and Education":.
- The need to learn will not be lost with the development of AI.
- Legitimacy of AI generated products and ideas are determined by humans
- Valuable creation is attributed to human beings, and while styles change, the essence remains the same.
Summary of everyone's code slides:.
- Photography is an example of how technological advances are changing values, but the importance of ideas remains the same.
- Creativity is a deep joy that comes through challenge, and children experience it through programming.
- Curiosity about the obscure and challenges is the key to creative education.
Programming Education Status and Issues Summary:.
- Current programming education focuses on fostering logical thinking, but the implementation rate is only about 40%.
- The introduction of generative AI may cause confusion in educational settings.
- Possible methods include the creation of "information learning time" in elementary schools and serious study of generative AI in high schools.
Summary of future programming education directions:.
- Both directions are important as a means of "learning programming and generative AI" and "learning by
- Eight hours of classes using generative AI at A Elementary School in Inzai City
- Introduction of the &box Classroom, an AI sandbox tool in education, and insights after using the generated AI
Summary of the connection between generative AI and programming education:.
- Students develop the ability to understand and identify response patterns and technical characteristics of generative AI
- Important to identify and think about similarities and differences between humans and AI
- Need to understand how AI works and be aware of misinformation and halucinations caused by AI
Summary of Directions for Programming Education as a Means to:.
- Training to hone thinking skills and verbalize conceptual models through interaction with a generative AI
- Emphasizes learning and joy in the process of creation and improvement of explanatory skills using dialogue
Summary of Changes in Programmatic Thinking as a Challenge for Generative AI:.
- Fostering the ability to think beyond traditional programming with the advent of generative AI
- Cultivate the ability to logically explain to a generative AI in natural language while imagining the finished product
- Programmatic thinking shifts to learning and joy in the process of creating works of art
Summary of the issue of layers of consumption and creation in the age of generative AI:.
- Before generative AI, ideas and skills were the foundation of creation
- After introduction of AI, ideas alone form the middle layer, differentiated into layers that consume AI recommendations and content.
- Even after AI, the creative layer will remain important, and idea-driven creation will be emphasized.
Summary of "consumption" and "creation" issues in the age of generative AI:.
- Learning and experience are important to enable the transition from the consumer class to the middle class and then to the creative class
- Co-evolution with AI is encouraged by turning the learning into a work of art and guiding children to be committed to the project.
Summary of relevance of Scratch and generative AI:.
- Scratch developer Mitchel Resnick urges caution about the changes that the use of generative AI will have on programming learning
- Generative AI could provide an intuitive and natural programming experience, and combined with Scratch, help focus expressiveness
Summary and Significance of Programming Education:.
- Generative AI enhances creative style and expression and emphasizes the "joy of creating.
- Need to update definition of "programmatic thinking" and shift from thinking skills to creation
- School education is required to play a role in developing creative attitudes rather than simply consuming content recommended by AI.
