- Spatial Arrangement.

Your own one-person Scrapbox project
- Personal Knowledge Managememt
- Closed to individuals
    - membrane
- Linking together across projects
- attention

AI manages tasks.
- Project Management
- Motivation Management
- Long-term, no deadlines and a vast amount of relevant knowledge
- Valued characters make decisions.
- Keichobot reads Scrapbox page and asks
    - Summarized with attention to Next Action

Kozaneba to discuss Cybozu Days again
- Assuming that the publicly available portions will be made available later.

Knead again the omni consideration Kozaneba
- Keep it private and create a broad map that includes the peripheral themes of life.
- Plurality, for example.

Keichobot's Log
- awareness
- bad status
- Timing of Value Questions
- Well-digested keywords
    - Related questions
- next action
- Extract and visualize with GPT

Tools that are useful to you
- OCR of Table of Contents -> Scrapbox
    - Fine tuning will do it.
- Dig deeper with Keichobot based on the nodes of thought in Scrapbox
    - Keyword extraction and weighting
- motivate oneself
    - By deciding on a Next Action
        - orienting
    - Keichobot for this purpose.
            - [[üåÄClean language as a board game as a concrete implementable idea.]]

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You are the program responsible for deepening human thinking by issuing digging questions about key words. As a preliminary step to the questioning, read the fragmentary notes written by the human to extract the concepts that are the subject of the digging questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>Consider the following questions for concepts to be extracted from the memo
- Support for verbalization - How does fragmentation of thought help language development, and what are some of the processes that fill in the gaps between those fragments?
- One's own Scrapbox project - What is the role of the "membrane" in a personal knowledge management system and how does it contribute to or hinder the linking of projects?
- AI manages tasks - In the context of project management without clear deadlines, how does an AI prioritize tasks and what personality traits does it employ to manage motivation and decision making?
- Cybozu Days talk - what are the considerations in determining the public portion of a discussion and how to refine these discussions using Kozaneba?
- Kneading once again the omni consideration Kozaneba - how beneficial is the mapping of broad, life-related themes and how does one determine what stays private and what is public in such a mapping?
- Keichobot logs - what insights can be gleaned from logs of moments of realization, bad status, and timing of value questions?
- Useful tool for me - how can I optimize the Table of Contents OCR to Scrapbox and use Keichobot to deepen the nodes of thought within Scrapbox?
These questions go deep into methods of organization, the use of AI for task and motivational management, and the interaction of public and private knowledge in personal management systems.


<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>Score these extracted concepts on a 5-point scale: "degree of abstraction," "degree of human sensation," "degree of movement," and "degree of metaphor.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>To evaluate these extracted concepts, the following scale can be used where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.

Language Support
- Degree of abstraction: 4 (the process of verbalization requires a high level of abstract understanding in order to give abstract thoughts concrete form)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by human senses: 3 (senses are indirectly related and have more to do with the process of perception and representation than with concrete sensory data)
- Degree of movement: 2 (more emphasis is placed on the static process of verbalization than on movement)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by metaphors: 3 (metaphors are often used to verbalize concepts, but are not required)

Your own one-person Scrapbox project
- Degree of abstraction: 5 (personal knowledge management and its structure is a very abstract concept)
    - I get the feeling that the "degree of abstraction" isn't coming across very well.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
        - My feeling is that "language support" is too abstract to be appropriate for the question, and "my one person Scrapbox project" is more specific than that, which is preferable.
- Degree of human sensory accompaniment: 2 (focus on knowledge and information management rather than direct sensory experience)
- Degree of movement: 1 (very static activity of managing information)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by metaphors: 4 (metaphors such as "membrane" and "link" of knowledge are used)
    - Okay, it seems useful to delve into this "membrane" or "link".<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

AI manages tasks.
- Degree of abstraction: 4 (AI decision-making processes are abstract concepts)
- Degree of human sensory involvement: 1 (AI does not involve human senses directly)
- Degree of movement involved: 2 (management of the task involves dynamic elements, but is itself a non-physical process)
- Degree of metaphor: 3 (metaphor is included in the expression "the character makes decisions")

Talking about Cybozu Days
- Degree of abstraction: 3 (the content of the discussion is concrete, but the organization of it and the decision to publish it are more abstract)
- Degree of human sensory involvement: 3 (discussion of actual events includes sensory experiences)
- Degree of movement involved: 2 (the argument contains dynamic elements, but the process of reconstructing it is static)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by metaphors: 2 (may be less specific metaphors)

Keichobot's Log
- Degree of abstraction: 3 (logs contain concrete data, but the act of analyzing them is abstract)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by human sensations: 4 (awareness and emotional states are deeply rooted in human sensations)
- Degree of movement: 2 (insights from logs are mainly static, but bad status changes, for example, are accompanied by movement)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by metaphors: 2 (metaphors may be used, but the analysis is based on literal information)

Tools that are useful to you
- Degree of abstraction: 4 (tool optimization involves concrete steps, but the idea is abstract)
- Degree of human sensory involvement: 2 (more related to theoretical optimization process than to sensory experience)
- Degree of motion involved: 1 (use of the tool is a static process)
- Degree to which it is accompanied by metaphors: 2 (less metaphors for specific tool optimization)

These ratings are only general guidelines and may vary depending on individual interpretation and context.

It swings too abstractly at the initial "select keywords" stage to begin with.
