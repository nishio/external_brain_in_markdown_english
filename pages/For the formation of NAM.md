<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/Claude/icon' alt='Claude.icon' height="19.5"/>This text is the content of a lecture given by Yukito Karatani on the occasion of the formation of the New Associationist Movement (NAM). It can be summarized as follows.
- NAM is a new [[associationism]] ([[unionism]]) movement against [[capitalism, nationalism, and nationalism]]. Associationism inherits the ideas of [[anarchism]], but critically overcomes them from a [[Marxist]] perspective.
- Capitalism, nationalism, and nationalism are each rooted in different [[principles of exchange]] and have a mutually reinforcing relationship. To counteract this, associations that create non-capitalist forms of exchange, production, and consumption based on free individual contracts are necessary.
- The NAM's organizing principle is [[pluralism]] or [[participatory democracy]], in which representatives are elected from each line of regions, interests, and hierarchies, and positions are determined by lot drawing. In addition, LETS ([[local currency]]) is used for activities among members.

- NAM will conduct counter-movements inside the capitalist system, while at the same time creating non-capitalist forms of production and consumption outside of it. To this end, it will make various practical attempts in the areas of enterprise, publishing, and education.
- NAM is a transnational movement that is not limited to a single national movement, and emphasizes information sharing and discussion via the Internet. It aims to develop the movement through the spontaneous creativity of each of its members.

> First, I would like to explain the name NAM. The [[New Associationist Movement]] ([[NAM]]) is, in Japanese, something like the New Associationist Movement. [[Associationism]] was conceived by early socialists like [[Owen]] and [[Proudhon]]. It was specifically theorized by Proudhon as "[[the]] principle of association."
>  In Japan, during the Taisho era, the anarchist Sakae Osugi advocated "Rengo-shugi" (coalitionism). So until this period, the term "[[Rengo-shugi]]" was commonly used in Japanese. However, today, the term "Rengo-Shyugi" is not well understood and would rather be misunderstood. That is why I have chosen not to use the term in Japanese. Furthermore, this movement has been [[transnational]] from the beginning, and it should be immediately recognizable to foreigners. That is why I decided to call it NAM.
>  Another aside, a monk who asked about the NAM said that it is gratifying to us. Because it is Namu Amidabutsu or Namu Myoho-renge-kyo Namu (lol). Of course, I welcome the participation of monks. For example, [[Mondragon]], a [[production cooperative]] created by the Basque minority in Spain, is now a huge enterprise with branches all over the world, but it was a catholic monk who started it. It was a catholic monk who started it.

> Our movement cannot do without the Internet. We want everyone who joins the NAM to have a computer or at least have access to one. First, this is a financial issue for the NAM. We do not have the money or manpower to communicate by letter or fax. Second, the Internet is essential for people in different parts of the country to communicate with each other quickly. The Center Council, as well as the interest and regional sections, are constantly communicating and discussing via all-person mailing lists. The results are posted on the website. This is why computers are indispensable. Some people say they are not very good at it, but if you contact NAM, there is someone who can help you technically.
It's amazing that in this day and age (2000) you conceived of an Internet-driven movement.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

> Finally, one thing I want to emphasize here is that I do not want you to ask me or the NAM Secretariat what you should do or how you should do it. I want each person to be creative in what he or she does within or beyond the scope of his or her own interests. NAM exists as an association of such people.
