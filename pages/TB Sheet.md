Sheet for task breakdown
- According to [[DIPS Intellectual Productivity System]].

- When we receive a request, we first decide on the final completed "object".
- List of things to do in terms of [HIROEN
    - Hear: What do you hear?
    - Inform: Do you ever contact them?
    - Request: What are you requesting?
    - Operate: What is to be worked on?
    - Examine: What to consider?
    - Negotiate: What do you negotiate?
- In short, people tend to be conscious of "what I work on," but it is more efficient to identify early what to ask, contact, request, and negotiate with others, and to run parallel with myself, because it is more efficient to do so.
