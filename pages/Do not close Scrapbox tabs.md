title: "Do not close Scrapbox tabs"
---

- When newly opened, it takes a while before it appears.
- I have a habit of closing tabs when I'm done working, but with [[Scrapbox]] it might be better to leave them alone.
- But if I have multiple projects open in tabs, I can't tell which tab is which project.
- Is that the problem with having too many tabs open so that you can only see the icons?
