    - The [[usefulness]] of defining the [[boundary]] of the [[concept]].
    - In the figure, two people are disputing the boundary of concept X.
    - They dispute whether the black circle case near the boundary is included in X.
    - Would that argument be useful?

    - Even if the boundary of X is not clear, we can use the fact that the white circle is included in X
    - Isn't [[over-quality]] trying to clarify the boundaries of X?
