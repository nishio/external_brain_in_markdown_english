title: "Language Barriers to Attention"
---

- [[machine translation]] It has been argued that the development of technology will eliminate the need for humans to learn English. However, this argument has a low resolution.

Suppose a Japanese person is interested in a certain worldwide project. A document written in English can be machine translated and read.

Suppose a Japanese person is working on a project and writes a document in Japanese. English speakers can read it by machine translation "if they are interested". The question is how this "if interested" prerequisite is established.

People do not have [[interest (in something)]] in things written in a language they cannot read. In other words, there is a [[language barrier]] in obtaining [[attention]]. In [[Attention mobile voting]], they are not considered to be eligible for voting.

Another expression
- Barriers to being a consumer of information go down.
- Barriers to being a producer of information are also lowered.
    - However, there is an increase in cost due to the need to transmit in English instead of Japanese
    - This ultimately depends on where you think your customer or market is #define customer
        - Is the market for "[[Japanese speaker]] only" OK? That's the question.
            - [The problem is that Japan was halfway big.
