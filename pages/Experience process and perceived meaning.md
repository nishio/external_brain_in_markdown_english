Experience process and perceived meaning
What does it mean?
- "the process of experience and the creation of meaning."
- There are several dimensions.
    - Relationships among linguistic symbols
    - Relationship between the symbol and the object
    - Besides this, there is the dimension of "experience."
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The translations of "experience" and "experience" are shaky, but both are Experience.
- Dimensions of Experience
    - Easy to understand when "the symbols do not properly symbolize the meaning we experience."
    - > waving, pointing, talking at length, coming up with metaphors, giving examples, silence to find words
        - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>In other words, there is a fuzziness, excitement, discomfort, etc. that I can't quite put my finger on.
    - This state is described as "We are experiencing a meaning
        - Another way to say "we feel a meaning" means the same thing
    - > We notice that "symbols that usually seem to contain our meaning do not seem to be appropriate to this present sense of meaning.
    - >  In other words, meaning is not just a matter of things or symbols or their relationship... It is also something that is felt and experienced.
    - Since this paper deals with this kind of "meaning," I will use the expressions "felt meaning" and "experienced meaning.
    - The Japanese translation is considered "felt meaning."
        - It comes up many times after this as a single lumpy phrase, "felt meaning."
        - How does perceived meaning work in cognition?" is the theme of the book.
    - <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>The Japanese translation process has broken it up into different symbols, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the symbols.

            - In later Thinking at the edge, felt sense is often used, and the Japanese translation is "[[felt sense]]", which is clear.
            - (aside) [[Thinking at the edge of the edge]].
