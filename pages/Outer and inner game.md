Just a quick point 👇.

What is [[inner game]]/[[outer game]]?
- Inner game: part of facing disturbances in the mind ([[distraction]], [[anxiety]], [[self-denial]], [[forcefulness]], etc.) and recovering [[learning]], concentration, and enjoyment.
- Outer game: the part of the game where you fight against external opponents, challenges, and environments (techniques, tactics, results, etc.).
- The tennis classic The Inner Game of Tennis was first systematized (1974). ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf), [[The Systems Thinker https:// thesystemsthinker.com/the-inner-game-of-work-building-capability-in-the-workplace/]])

core model
- Self 1 / Self 2：
    - Self 1 = The "[[speaking self]]" (manifest consciousness) that commands and evaluates.
    - Self 2 = Actual "[[do-it-yourself]]" (body and automatic learning).
The trick is to reduce interference from Self 1 and trust Self 2 to perform. ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf))
- Formula: Performance = Potential - Interference
- Outcome = Potential - Interference
    - The less interference (self-criticism, over-tension, over-direction), the better the results. ([The Systems Thinker](https://thesystemsthinker.com/the-inner-game-of-work-building-capability-in-the-workplace/))

Typical skills (inner side)
1. non-judgmental awareness
    - Observe the "facts as they are happening now" without judging by good or bad. Because judgments stiffen the body's flow and hinder learning. ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf), [Farnam Street [https://fs.blog/inner](https://fs.blog/inner) -game-of-tennis/])
2. self-direction through images rather than words
    - Communicate to Self 2 with images and senses such as "let the trajectory pass here" rather than "hit it like this". ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf))
3. let it happen (let it happen) x focus (relaxed focus)
    - A cycle of clear intent -> delegation -> observation, rather than "force to do." ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf))

Application to work/study (very practical)
- 30-second routine
    1. define the objectives in one line (external: results / internal: learning/enrichment).
    2. check where your attention is now (where you look/what you feel).
    3. replace the evaluation word with an observation word ("poor performance → racket surface is lagging behind").
    4. image of the desired result → delegate → observe the result without evaluation.
This idea has been extended from sports to the workplace, explaining that reducing interference enhances performance and learning simultaneously. ([The Systems Thinker](https://thesystemsthinker.com/the-inner-game-of-work-building-capability-in-the-workplace/))

Points that are often misunderstood
- I'm not talking about increasing positive thinking: less evaluation (good/bad) and more factual observation. ([Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/inner-game-of-tennis/))
- Not a substitute for technical practice: outer (skills) and inner (mental handling) are two wheels. ([Mentoring Group](https://mentoringgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf))

In depth: The original book, "The Inner Game of Tennis," details the relationship between Self1/2 and the skill set of dealing with inner disturbances. For business applications, Gallwey's own discussion ("The Inner Game of Work") summarizes the key points.
