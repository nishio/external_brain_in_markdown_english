    - [[Good ideas solve multiple problems at once.]]

> [karaage0703](https://x.com/karaage0703/status/1918434513526645150) I learned about Mr. Miyamoto's idea from a book called Mr. Iwata > I contributed to Engineer TYPE's book report on professionals in "Mr. Iwata" I contributed to the book report of professionals by [engineer TYPE's book report of professionals by "Mr. Iwata" - karaage.
