title: "subject-object exchange"

2024-08-31
"[[It's]] me who thinks I'm the subject."

I feel like it's a crazy useful technique.

From [[the indivisibility of act and actor]], act and actor are in the form [[unparalleled in history (unparallelled)]], which of course can be reversed because this is a symmetrical relation
- When actor A does act B, it can also be considered that actor B does act A
    - [[Acting Actor Exchange]]
- When the subject S performs an act V on the object O
    - Can be interpreted in 3 different ways!
    - One of them, "subject O performs act V on object S," is subject-object exchange.
    - It was born as a derivative of "act-actor exchange," because it is rare to do an act without an object in the first place, and because it is easier to understand the exchange of subject and object than the exchange of act and actor, and because the types are closer together.
        - 2025-04-12 This exchange is used to generate humor Soviet Russia inversion: "In the old country, television watch you!"[In Soviet Russia - Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki) /In_Soviet_Russia]

Actual example (not so pretty when rearranged again)
    - [[Individuals who drill holes in walls]]
    - (S:me) opens (O:hole) -> from (S:hole) viewpoint, (O:me) is there and moving around
    - [[Non-linear time]]
    - (S:me) writes (O:page) -> (S:page) viewpoint, (O:me) stays, internal state changes in the middle
