> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459458182598692873): I don't have [[fighting spirit]] or [[guts]]. twitter.com/plum_very/stat...

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459458645721116672): "[[Motivation ebbs and flows...]]", so I'm trying to live my life "advancing as much as possible during a moment of heightened tension. I feel like I'm doing that.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459459427371679745): you're right up to "in a moment", but I don't think it's necessarily "going as much as possible".
> Tend to target things that can be managed in the blink of an eye [[Instantaneous and Sustained Action]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459460718290345985): In 2007, you wrote in your diary, "I tried to imitate someone who writes steadily, but it doesn't work, this is a failure to imitate someone who has never run a full marathon and is used to running. I should write in a more savage way instead.
    - [[I can't write steadily.]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459488106256613376): I forgot to mention that when I heard "spirit and guts" I thought of "[[hurdler]]" from "[[Ten Faces of Innovation]]"
