- There's an expression that goes "hobby and practicality."
- The two are independent axes in the first place, since they are described as "combining" when they are combined.
- From the perspective of practical benefit, bringing up a hobbyist perspective like "I don't want to speed-read novels" when we're talking about speed-reading reference material is not a distinction.
