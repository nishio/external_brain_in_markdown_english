> [@terrakei07](https://twitter.com/terrakei07/status/1628311550053449729?s=20): [[humanities]] are [[useless]], but that's "from [[be useful]]". Only those who can get the message should get the message.
> [@koshian](https://twitter.com/koshian/status/1628311835517788160?s=20): Well, I'm one of those people who spent a lot of time in the [[history of Western thought]] when I was young, so I understand very well. I understand. ......
> [@koshian](https://twitter.com/koshian/status/1628312405313990656): I think there's actually a connection between studying thought and why I'm a programmer.

> I'm learning about computers and the internet, and this is a bunch of pragmatism, and I "fell" with too big of a shock!

[[""useful" to "useless"]] is a very interesting expression.
- But there seem to be a lot of people who don't get the message...
- My understanding.
    - Pragmatism: "What is useful to me is the right thing to do."
    - This, in the eyes of others, is "I don't understand why he said one thing is right and then said something very similar is not right" (= his argument is useless).
