Chatbots are tied to a single topic and dig in.
Besides the effect of the chatbot asking questions to sway your point of view, maybe for people who are easily distracted (and whose point of view moves around easily), the turn-based communication has the effect of tying them to a single topic and digging in.

- > I think that using [[turn-based communication]] in the UI has the advantage of allowing us to focus on a single "thing to do now.
- >  [[Keicho]] or something like that.

    - Talk about making an unfinished task into one.
- Talk to Keicho
        - [[Chatbots also have the effect of focusing]]
    - summary
        - Chatting for 25 minutes has the effect of keeping you focused on one subject for 25 minutes.
        - This is similar to dialogue, but unlike voice, which disappears, a log is kept and can be read back and searched.
        - Human intelligence is strengthened by new "means of deepening thinking"
