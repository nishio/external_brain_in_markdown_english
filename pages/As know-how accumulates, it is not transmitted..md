It [[transmission]] it [[signal]] to find people who are doing similar things. If the people who see what is transmitted are of the same kind, they will receive the signal normally, but if they are not, they will try to find meaning in the "unimportant" object.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640346254516338692) When [[know-how]] is accumulated by doing "unimportant things", it is used to start doing "unimportant things". This is not transmitted in the same way as "unimportant things. To the observer, it appears to stop. It comes out after a while, when it has reached a level of perfection. To those who have not "accumulated," it appears as if a leap has been made.
- As know-how accumulates, it is not transmitted.

They hit the button repeatedly as the probability of reward gradually decreases.

I was thinking about what kind of signals people who are giving signals that I feel are a step ahead of me are giving now, such as running LLM locally, using vector DBs, and talking about American Equity (I'm way behind on the last one...).
