<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> The word "participate" in English captures the idea of taking part in an activity or event. This concept is expressed differently in Japanese and Mandarin, with subtle nuances in each language.

Japanese:
- 参加 (Sanka): This is the most common translation of "participate" in Japanese. It generally means to join or take part in an event, activity, or group. It's used in a broad range of contexts, from participating in a meeting to joining a party.
- 参画 (Sankaku): This word is more specific and nuanced. It implies not just participation but also contributing to or being involved in the planning or creative process of an event or project. It suggests a deeper level of engagement than simply attending or being present.

Mandarin:
- 参加 (Cānjiā): Similar to its Japanese counterpart, "参加" in Mandarin means to participate or join in. It's a general term used for involvement in various activities, events, or groups.
- 參與 (Cānyù): This term is more about being involved in something, especially in a way that contributes or has an impact. It suggests a more active or influential role in the participation process.

Comparison with Japanese "参与":
- 参与 (Sanyo) in Japanese: This term, although not as commonly used as "参加," aligns more closely with the Mandarin "參與." It implies involvement or engagement in an activity or process, often with a sense of contributing or having an influence.

In summary, while "参加" in both Japanese and Mandarin conveys the general idea of participation, "参画" in Japanese and "參與" in Mandarin imply a deeper, more active or creative involvement. The Japanese "参与," though less common, shares similarities with the Mandarin "參與" in terms of suggesting active engagement or influence.
