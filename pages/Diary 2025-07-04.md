The former is inferior to the latter because it is simply a fantasy. New technologies change the competitive environment by altering costs. Inevitably, the ability to adapt to changes in the environment will be tested.
>  >rk611: Hot topic I heard at IVS: at DeNA, product plans are no longer accepted in the form of a proposal, you have to come up with a proto using Devin, etc.
>  Oh no.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1941012364637442268) "Deeply considered" is subjective to the proposer and cannot be a criterion for judging because the judges cannot observe it or compare it to other proposers.
>  "Long time thinking" can be measured, but it is still not valued because long time thinking based on wrong assumptions has zero value.
>  >cactaceae: I wonder if prototypes are mandatory as a result of deeper knowledge because we are building prototypes...
>  If I were a judge, I'd want to judge by how deeply I thought about it.

This is a realistic ratio of AI utilization. The reality is that 40% of the work can be done by AI, which increases productivity by 1.7 times.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1941157503435505938) I thought 1.7x was a little low, but the human counted commits were also 80% AI!
