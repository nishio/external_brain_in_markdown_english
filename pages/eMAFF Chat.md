title: "eMAFF Chat"
---

>  [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] began a demonstration using "[[Slack]]" on December 1, 2020 to communicate with local government officials and agricultural workers. MAFF staff, local government officials, agricultural workers, and researchers will participate across organizations. About 400 people have registered so far. Channels have been set up for "current problems," "administrative procedures at MAFF," "damage photos," etc., and discussions are being held to share information and raise issues related to agriculture.

> "The goal of using Slack is to provide a place online where farmers can talk with local officials and municipalities before using [[eMAFF]] to complete the process. We knew we needed a chat function as part of [[eMAFF]]." Many agricultural workers are accustomed to chatting in their daily work. We have started a demonstration experiment to confirm the need for a chat tool, and will use chat to introduce the eMAFF and answer questions," explained Mr. Haruo Hatakeyama, Director of the Informatization Promotion Section, Digital Strategy Group, Minister's Secretariat, MAFF.

> Generous support from Slack Japan, including free use of Slack's paid environment for a limited time
- It's only for a limited time...
- I don't think Slack's regular plan would be cost-effective for an unspecified number of people for use cases.
- I wonder if Slack will offer a separate license for the public from their side.
    - If they don't, I'm going to say, "I know it's beneficial, but I don't like the cost, so I'm going to go with [[Mattermost]]! I'll go with [[Mattermost]] because it's not worth the cost!

> According to Microsoft Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Supreme Court of Japan have begun using Teams respectively, and several ministries and agencies have provided Teams for a total of 40,000 employees.
- [[Microsoft Teams]]

> About 30% of municipalities nationwide have adopted [[LoGo Chat]], which is operated by [[Trust Bank]].
