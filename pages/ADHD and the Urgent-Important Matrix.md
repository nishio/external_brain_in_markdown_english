title: "ADHD and the Urgent/Important Matrix"

[[ADHD]] and [[Urgent/Important Matrix]].
- The concept of [[emergency]] in [[Urgent/Important Matrix]] is difficult with ADHD in the first place.
- Processes involving others are more urgent, even if the time to deadline is the same.
- Because it is difficult to predict "how much time others will spend

> [autis33](https://twitter.com/autis33/status/1721922011797279215) I've been recommended a priority matrix by someone with ADHD, but I don't understand what is and isn't urgent. I don't know what's important or not important, and I'm stuck.
> [autis33](https://twitter.com/autis33/status/1721925468654543110) I think this matrix situation is unsuitable because it's common for people to say "I don't think what others think is important is important".
>  Simple.
>  1) High urgency
>  ②Low urgency
>  I feel like these two areas are all we need.
> [autis33](https://twitter.com/autis33/status/1721925730274291924) I don't know the difference between "less urgent but important" and "urgent but not important".
>  I think I'm going to get head tired from this and sleep for a few hours lol.

> [yama1269](https://twitter.com/yama1269/status/1721987468088738186/photo/1) I thought the same thing a long time ago. I asked a friend who taught me and he said, "It's easier to understand if you think about whether or not there are people involved. Now it comes in handy.

> [hirakata1976](https://twitter.com/hirakata1976/status/1722144360643678330) This is true. There are quite a few people, especially those who confuse 'urgent' with 'important', regardless of whether they have a disability or not.
- I don't agree with this diagram.<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - The person who drew this diagram may also be [[""someone who confuses 'urgent' with 'important'"]].

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1721987468088738186/photo/1) My wife coached me on this too. I didn't understand at the time that it takes many times longer than a single person's estimate of the work because other people don't move at their own convenience or don't communicate what they think.
- Tip: This is not about "[[Urgent/Important Matrix]]".
    - I'm with you on "it's easier to understand when you think about whether or not someone is involved."
    - Processes involving other people have much less "time left" than physical deadlines because the other person's part of the process does not work the way you want it to.
        - I didn't understand this until my wife taught me.
        - This doesn't feel like ADHD, it's more like I have a hard time imagining other people living on a different time scale than I do.
    - Processes involving others require a high estimate of urgency because of the short "time remaining" and unpredictability
    - In the first place, in the "[[Urgent/Important Matrix]]," all jobs with deadlines are in the first area of "Urgent/Important," so the question of "which to start when there are multiple jobs with deadlines" is outside the scope of the matrix.

                - Figure from [[Seven Habits]] p. 215
        - Processes involving others are more urgent and should be given top priority when there are multiple tasks in the first area

> [zacky1972](https://twitter.com/zacky1972/status/1724273507398307906) I have a slightly different opinion. I can see the problem if you refer to the third habit of the 7 Habits.
- [The "deadline-keeping" research style that should be taken by the type of researcher who can concentrate on whatever interests him at the moment - Susumu Yamazaki Laboratory, ZACKY's Laboratory](https://zacky1972.github.io/blog/2023/04/05/deadline.html)
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1724275717473775942) I read your blog post and I don't particularly disagree with it, so I think we are just expressing the same thing differently. I am of the opinion that it is important to do the following
>  > Work requests that have a grace period before the deadline at the time of initial notification... means that anything that needs to be done by someone else will be done by someone else as soon as possible.
> [zacky1972](https://twitter.com/zacky1972/status/1724280548682854499) Not only there, but the most important point is to devote as much time as possible to non-urgent, important work!
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1724323636667138096) That's just what the 7 habits say, which is not interesting to me because there is no new information for me. The original thread is more developed and interesting.

>  If you name an axis, why are those two axes important in the first place? Why are those two axes important in the first place, and why not other axes? It is useful to look at things from the perspective of "why are those two axes important in the first place, and why not other axes?
