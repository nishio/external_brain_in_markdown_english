title: "Too high a demand for logical thinking."
---


- [[too demanding]] of [[logical thinking]].

I have firsthand experience that even if you get 100 college graduates together, the majority of them cannot do logical thinking.
But you're way out of step with the rest of the world.
I just realized that my idea of "logical thinking" in this case is just too high compared to the rest of the world.

For a complex and intertwined problem that cannot be understood at a quick glance, we need to think logically about what we can do to obtain information, conduct experiments to obtain observed facts, and then use that knowledge to think logically about...
- To solve a problem that would take O(e^N) effort in blind trial and error by repeating this process with O(N) effort.
        - [[Binary Search Debugging]]
        - [[Efficiency of coin search]]

- This is roughly equivalent to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering in the field of [[empirical science]], if you consider it to be [[a level at which you can carry out research independently]].
    - That's not much.
