title: 'Semantic Annotation as "Tax Payment'
---

I put it in my own words.
    - [[Cryptocurrency as payment for work done for AI]]

-----
[[Semantic Annotation as "tax payment" may be necessary in a future where each DAO has an AI]].
- "[[Semantic Annotation]] as "[[payment of taxes]]

[/tkgshn/proof-of-human-as-post-AGI-taxes](https://scrapbox.io/tkgshn/proof-of-human-as-post-AGI-taxes).
- [[Proof of Human]]

- [[Work to open up the forest of what has yet to be written.]] and then "pay taxes" on it, a society where one's livelihood is rationed?
    - [[basic income]] ？
    - No, it's like giving a minimum to those who don't work and giving those who do intellectual production more budgetary freedom to enjoy that intellectual production?
    - It's like a growing credit card limit.
    - If a non-working person tries to rent a comic book from the library, they are refused, but if they have a track record of historical research, they can rent it.


- Associated with [payment of taxes
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>You have a theory that the ability to use the currency to pay taxes was a guarantee of its value. Briefly explain in bullet points.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Collateral for the value of a currency: The value of a currency is collateralized by the government's acceptance of that currency for payment of taxes.
    - Money Issuing Authority: The government has the authority to issue and control the country's currency.
    - Tax collection: Governments maintain demand for their currency by collecting taxes from their citizens and making them pay in that currency.
    - Currency trust: As long as taxes are paid in that currency, the public believes in the value of the currency and will continue to use it.
    - Currency Circulation: Currency is used for domestic transactions and circulated in economic activities.
    - Currency Stability: The government collects a steady stream of taxes and maintains the value of the currency, thereby stabilizing the value of the currency.
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What is the name of the idea?
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>It is known as "Chartist Theory" or part of "[[Modern Monetary Theory]] (MMT)." Chartist theory asserts that the value of a currency is guaranteed by the collection of taxes by the state.

In Japanese[[tokenism]] というらしい<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Will the currency lose value? I thought, rather the opposite?

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>Even if a giant AI outsources "tasks that AI cannot do" to humans, and taxes are paid through that labor, the currency will still maintain its value.
- Reward for labor: Humans are paid in currency for the work they perform on behalf of the AI.

Nope? Is this my concept of "currency" vague?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>For the sake of accurate discussion, let's separate the concept of "currency" into "currency issued by an existing state" X and "tokens issued in return for work on a giant AI" Y
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>Separate the discussion in the case of existing state-issued currency (X) and tokens issued in return for work on a giant AI (Y):
- Currency X:
    - a. Security of value: The state maintains the value of currency X through the collection of taxes.
    - b. Tax revenue: The government can maintain tax revenue by having humans earn currency X as revenue through their labor.
    - c. Economic Circulation: Economic circulation continues as currency X is used for domestic transactions and economic activities.
- Token Y:
    - a. Security of Value: The value of Token Y serves as a right of access to the services and resources provided by the giant AI.
    - b. Labor Reward: A human performs a task that an AI cannot do, and is rewarded with token Y for his/her labor.
    - c. Interchangeability: If token Y is interchangeable with currency X, people can convert token Y to currency X and pay taxes as currency X.
    - d. Unique economic sphere: Token Y could form its own economic sphere as it is used to trade services and resources provided by the giant AI.
- In this situation, currency X and token Y coexist and have different values and functions. When a human earns token Y as income through labor, if it is exchangeable for currency X, it can be used to pay taxes or for other economic activities. In this way, both can be considered to be related to each other and maintain their respective values and economic activities.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>What happens to the exchange ratio if it is exchangeable? What happens if it is not exchangeable?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/GPT-4/icon' alt='GPT-4.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Exchange ratio, if available:
    - Supply and Demand: The exchange ratio between currency X and token Y is determined by market supply and demand. This is influenced by the amount of both currencies in circulation, available service resources, and economic conditions.
    - Volatility: The exchange ratio will fluctuate depending on market conditions and the creditworthiness and stability of both currencies. Government and giant AI policies and regulations can also affect the exchange ratio.
    - Interrelationship of value: Because the value of currency X and token Y affect each other, changes in the exchange ratio can affect the economic sphere of both currencies.
- If not interchangeable:
    - Parallel economic spheres: Currency X and Token Y form independent economic spheres, each with a different standard of value. Currency X is used for traditional national economic activities, while Token Y is used to trade services and resources provided by the giant AI.
    - IMPACT ON TAX PAYMENT: since taxes cannot be paid with Token Y, people will need to keep their income in Currency X. This maintains demand for currency X and preserves its value.
    - Value of Token Y: The value of Token Y is limited to access to services and resources provided by the giant AI. Therefore, while there is a certain demand for Token Y, the scope of its circulation will be more limited than that of Currency X.
    - When not interchangeable, currency X and token Y are less susceptible to each other and form independent economic spheres. In this situation, the value of currency X is maintained primarily by the state's tax collection, while the value of token Y is maintained by access to services and resources provided by the giant AI.
