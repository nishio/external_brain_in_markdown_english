- [[AI Agents]] bring about a sense of impersonality.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884606327017930928) Tangentially, I noticed [[idiosyncrasy]] increases as Devin's dependency increases. If humans and AI don't share knowledge, it's going to be a problem.
>  But this may be rather the opposite, depending on the company's make-up. I can think of one case where [[entrusted development]] is done, I'm rather glad that the knowledge remains in text form. In the case of in-house services, tacit knowledge is likely to increase.
> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884606329626755282) I intuitively thought so, but it's hard to verbalize...
>  Many jobs can be "learned in the process of doing the job," but the chance to learn is reduced as simple jobs are replaced by AI instead of humans.
>  We need opportunities to be taught "how to let AI do the work", but we don't have that chance in our jobs.
>  Rational, but gentile

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884607734194327641) It's hard to get across by saying "the way we let AI do the work", but this is a company-specific skill, not a general skill.
>  I guess you could call it "the skills to be a section manager in that company". You know where to find materials, you know who to ask in the company, you remember the past few years of work, that kind of thing.

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884608977969033319) Devin is Slack, so it's still visible to everyone. But Slack itself is flow, so it is not suitable for long-term accumulation of knowledge.
>  What is more egregious is the worldview where these AI agents are exchanged via DM. The more egregious worldview is one in which these AI agents communicate via DM, and knowledge is closed to individuals. But I have a feeling that the AI agents that will become popular in the general public will be along these lines...

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884609668523458635) How do I get Cosense to work from the CLI?

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884628531734577458) Okay, let me put it this way.
>  "That person is working as one person, which is equivalent to one development unit, so if that person quits, one team will disappear, and there is a risk of business survival.

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884629400077152674) In the days when humans wrote code, high-performing players were told to "swing the work to other engineers to scale the team,
>  I got an endless part time job working 24/7.
>  As a result of continually assigning work to him (AI), no one but him knew what he was doing.
>  Talk about that kind of risk.

> [teramotodaiki](https://x.com/teramotodaiki/status/1884632544886608026) Unless you have a personality that requires you to verbalize and accumulate all of your findings, fewer people to work with means more tacit knowledge. that leads to more tacit knowledge.
>  I'm sure development organizations in the Devin era will increase the importance of cross-sectional enablement to reduce this kind of gentrification.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1884988199526973547) AI will write daily/minute reports and all the findings will be written in Cosense or kintone. I think the companies that are communicating online at this point are simply "[AI will increase the number of employees by an order of magnitude.
