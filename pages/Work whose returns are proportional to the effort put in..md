title: "Work whose returns are proportional to the effort put in."

from  [[Diary 2024-04-08]]
[Returns are proportional to the [[effort]] put in [[work]].

The expression "[[linear order work]]" is the most appropriate from my point of view, so I need to [[change one's point of view]] to find [[an expression that can be easily conveyed to others]].
- Claude 3 Opus wrote to me that "Behavior B is just a linear order of magnitude (returns are proportional to the effort put in) job" and I was like "[[that's a nice expression]]"
- These things are better left to the LLMs.

- [[point of view]]
- [[representation]]
