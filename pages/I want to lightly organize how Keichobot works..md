<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I want to lightly organize how Keichobot works.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "Keichobot" is this "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Asking questions in response to user input
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "user" is this "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Those who have not yet clearly identified what it is that they want to talk about.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What kind of "recognize" is that "recognize"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>If you have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, just write it down, no need to have Keichobot ask you questions, it's not clear yet, so you need to shed light on it and clarify it by asking questions.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Do "keyword extraction," select keywords that look good, and ask questions about them
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- Where is this "Keichobot" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>By the user

- Where is this "Keichobot" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>To be precise, it's a smartphone near the user, connecting to a server far away.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Hmmm, maybe the explanation of how it works here should focus on knowledge that will help users use Keichobot better, in particular? If so, I think it would be useful to know that "Keichobot judges frequently occurring words as important words" and how it works.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I'm explaining because users don't know much about Keichobot, I'm the creator so I know the insides, but users don't.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, when I started this chat, all I could think of was "I need to explain how it works," but I saw the value in "explaining how it works so that the user can use it better."
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>How do you know its "users"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions after using the system, since there is no way to know more about it unless they write down their impressions in a visible place.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Where do these "users" come from?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>In this case, I'm going to give a presentation within the company, so I hope people within the company who see it will use it.

- Where is this "user" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Well, I don't expect that to be the case, because the population of people who would find this service valuable at this point is so small that it would not be very useful to narrow it down to a narrow internal market.

- What would you like to see happen with respect to this "user"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I hope it helps the person who uses it.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the "user" for that to happen?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>First you need to "try it" and the results of using it need to be fruitful.

- >  It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions of the product, since there is no way to know more about it unless they use it and write down their impressions in a visible place.
- What does this "user" seem to be?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Seeds. Water widely and some seeds suck it up and put out roots. The seed that takes root absorbs more water and grows bigger. It is not necessary for all of the land to sprout, and even if that were to happen, the land would die from lack of sunlight. Only a very small number of sprouts should grow and grow large.

- Where is this "user" located?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Cannot be observed until the buds emerge.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  I'm explaining it because users don't know much about Keichobot, I'm the creator so I know the internals, but users don't.
- What do you hope will happen regarding this "Keichobot"?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>This is water, and it's good to meet a species that wants water.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>
- >  It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions of the product, since there is no way to know more about it unless they use it and write down their impressions in a visible place.
- What is the relationship between this "user" and Keichobot?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>I was thinking in terms of the seed/water metaphor, not just for Keichobot, but for anything that happens to rain and sprout. It's a mismatch with the plant metaphor, but it's a system that allows plants to turn on their own sprinklers when they want water, instead of waiting for it to rain.
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>Is that "Keichobot" the same as "user"? Is it different?
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='/nishio/human.icon' height="19.5"/>Originally different but can be fused together to become one system
<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon' alt='/nishio/kei.icon' height="19.5"/>

- What happens to "Keichobot" when this "user"
