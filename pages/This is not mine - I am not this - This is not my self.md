The Japanese translation of the Pali formulaic phrase "n'etaṃ mama, n'eso'ham asmi, na me so attā" is
This is not mine/I am not this/this is not my self."
It is the "discipline of seeing" used by the Buddha for the five skandhas (color, perception, thought, action, and awareness) and the six realms (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind), and appears repeatedly in his second teaching, the Mushyasang Sutra (SN 22.59), and the six hexagrams (MN 148)**. ([SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What the three negatives point to
- "[[This is not mine]] (n'etaṃ mama)"...possessiveness = negation of the attachment "~ is mine". The five skandhas are not as one wants them to be, and they are not possessions. ([SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- I am not this" (n'eso'ham asmi)...denial of self-identification as "I am this. The "I" is not identified with the object or state. ([SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/mn148/en/bodhi?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- "[[This is not my self]] (na me so attā)"...does not project the idea of an unchanging **self (attā)**. No constant ego can be found in the five skandhas. ([SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

In later accounts, these three phrases are often
Thirst (taṇhā) = "this is mine**" / Pride (māna) = "I am this" / Evil (diṭṭhi) = "this is self "**.
may be solved by mapping it to (the exact source is the annotation system).

How to use it (practical implications)
1. take an object: notice, for example, that "sensations" or "thoughts" are occurring.
2. observation in three views:
    - This is not mine (uncontrollable and impermanent).
    - I am not this (do not identify).
    - This is not my self (not my unchanging ego).
The sutra teaches that this view is directly related to the cooling of attachment and the desire to renounce. ([SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
