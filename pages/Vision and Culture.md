- [[vision]] and [[culture]].
- The process of creating a "vision" is to verbalize the unspoken, unverbalized "[[values]]" that exist within each individual and turn them into words that can be shared.
- However, there are two patterns as to what happens after the "vision" is created
- Bad Pattern: Only the "words" of the vision stand alone
    - The word would be "groundless."
    - Words become "abstract concepts" that are detached from concrete experience and cannot be delved into.
- When the vision is actually used in the individual's daily actions and decisions, it is stored within the individual as an individual's internal [[experience]] ([[internalization]]).
    - This forms a loosely shared value system among several people, in a word, "[[culture]]."
    - Not the verbalized vision itself, but the value of this shared value "culture".
    - If this good pattern is followed, the words of the vision will not be considered absolute, and the words of the vision will be revised as needed.
    - If this good pattern is created, "vision" in the form of "short sentences" is not always necessary
        - In cases where, for example, the annual training slides for new employees are revised every year but convey basically the same values, these slides serve the same function as the vision

        - I was organizing the [[Unexplored Junior Question Box "Programming Knowledge"]] and thought that the different members were answering in the same direction without any specific consultation.
