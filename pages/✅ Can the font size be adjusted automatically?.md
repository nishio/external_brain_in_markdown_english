- [[Automatic font size adjustment]]
- Font size must be adjusted to a nice size
Regroup used to make stickies in Canvas.
Is it possible to have "stickies with auto-adjusting font size" in raw DOM?

Even if overflow: hidden, the scrollHeight will be increased after overflow, so it is possible to determine overflow.
[javascript - Check if an element's content is overflowing? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9333379/check-if-an-elements-content-is-overflowing)

- Pending on how to do [Align vertically centered

I can't test it in jsdom because scrollHeight is 0.
