title: "Overly complicated system"
---

    - A [[system]] that is too [[complex]] cannot be designed [[in advance]] in the brain
- Human cognitive abilities cannot [[verify]] whether a design on paper has [integrity
- So we need to create a verifiable computer implementation first.
- Gradually become more complex, do
- Naturally, it will be unmaintainable beyond human cognitive capacity.
- DNA of living organisms is also unmaintainable.
- Good as long as you can adapt to the environment

- Other things being equal, of course, the higher the maintenance, the better.
- However, in situations where it is unclear "whether the system can be realized" and "whether the realized system will bring value," verification of the system is the top priority.
- It is not a good choice if the verification is far from easy to maintain.
