title: "AI teaches keywords"

2023-03-19
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1637306195718582273?s=20): [[Formerly Search]] had human input "[Keywords. Now [[ChatGPT]] will create a sentence with keywords when you ask for [[Description.]], so it supports finding "keywords". Now I'm doing [[Google Search]] with those keywords and backtracking, but soon the machine will do that itself.
> [[GPT4]] says "Fortune has only bangs" is Vergilius, so I looked it up and it looks like "Fate sides with the bold" is correct. The meaning is close, so it's great that you come up with this.
> So the empty pages are now full: [[strike while the iron is hot]].
