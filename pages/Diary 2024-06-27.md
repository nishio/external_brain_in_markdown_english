Notes before going to bed

- [[new combination]]
    - [[Drawing a path where there is no path]]
    - A kind of [0→1
    - [[Drill a hole in the levee]]
    - [[connect the pipes]]
    - [[Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water]]
        - [[New combinations are not always beneficial.]]
    - If it can be determined by observation that it is not beneficial, don't do it.
    - If you are not sure, just try connecting it and see how the water flows.
        - [[making river]]
        - Do it at the lowest cost.
            - [[MVP]]
        - Specific example: some people can't express their opinions on Twitter or GitHub.
            - Solution:.
                - I'm going to ask the nursing home.
                - Create an anonymous opinion box
                - Make it accessible by phone
            - It is unknown which ones will be utilized and to what extent.
                - You'll never know unless you try.
                - Like a test of the MVP's customer existence hypothesis.
            - Phone calls were used more than anonymous suggestion boxes.
                - knowledge
[[Eliminate bottlenecks]]
- This is [[1 to 10]].
- flow through
    - Identify bottlenecks that are slowing the flow and widen them
    - [[Factorio]]-like
- [[Proactive and Reactive]]
    - [[False dichotomy]] Maybe.
- Observe the situation to find and eliminate bottlenecks
    - It can also be interpreted as a reactive response to the input of "bottleneck found.
    - It could be interpreted as proactively "identifying and eliminating bottlenecks.
    - Of the many "better to do" tasks, those that are the elimination of bottlenecks are given the highest priority for resolution.
        - This is a proactive priority decision.



> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1806127903916412989) > [AI will take away more electricity than jobs?　Environmental burden to consider from NVIDIA's solo run：The Asahi Shimbun Digital](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASS6T1W3PS6TUPQJ001M.html)
>  > The Llama 2 70B is estimated to have consumed 400 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity in the learning process. This is equivalent to about 16 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the average American in a year's life, measured in terms of global warming impact.
>
>  On the contrary, it's about 16 ？？？？
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806170286489788583) I did some quick research and found out that it takes 15 MWh to make 1 ton of aluminum. 68 million tons are made in a year.
> [erukiti](https://x.com/erukiti/status/1806171204665201029) I knew from some knowledge that making aluminum consumes a lot of electricity, but you are using a tremendous amount of electricity!
16 years is not enough to raise one average American to adulthood, and Llama 2 70B is a better deal than a human because of the amount consumed not only by the person but also by schools and food factories. Maybe even 700B is still a bargain (because they work hundreds of times more than one average American after they are made).



> [shinshoga](https://x.com/shinshoga/status/1806182589579084143) I was victimized by a single tweet I wrote wishing good luck to Akane Himasora. It was Mr. Genki Katsube and others who instigated it. I am still very angry.
[Complaints from business partners for supporting a specific candidate in the Tokyo gubernatorial election "Iwashita Shin Ginger" famous president complained of damage "seriously annoying" (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo!

Looks like you're in trouble.
Himasora v.s. Ishimaru would be a good way to get data to flood Polis with opposing opinions, but it's too deleterious.



> [takahiroanno](https://x.com/takahiroanno/status/1806259257672953940) I am working on improving the open source policy of the manifesto in the Tokyo gubernatorial election.

> [annotakahiro24](https://x.com/annotakahiro24/status/1806306490518819219) The Asahi Shimbun newspaper featured a great deal about #AI Anno, Takahiro Anno's activities!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806315756541604023) Once you vote, you can't change it later, you can see the results instantly once the voting is done. I think they probably don't want to show the results to people who didn't vote, so I cut that part out. It would be interesting to be able to observe them with different ages and such.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806316331987501386) I'll share. This voting experience was interesting to me personally, and even if you're not a city resident, it looks like it's a good idea to participate because it's properly counted separately from the city residents.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1804773117975490777) I think this (aside from being ready for this election) is a very good idea, technically feasible, useful, and interesting looking.

> [ya7ce](https://x.com/ya7ce/status/1806200180372627769) I'm starting to feel like I could help as a game designer w



> [kmizu](https://x.com/kmizu/status/1805714668423725177) I make meta references quite a bit, but it bothers me that sometimes they are mistaken for goofy references.
>  If you are in position A, you should not act B. If you are in position A, you should not act B. If you are in position B, you should not act B.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806027100371206500) Specific example, I said, "If you think 'one person, one vote is equal and preferable' then you have to think 'it is unequal for minors not to have the right to vote' to be consistent." I'd argue, but I'm not saying that I think 0-year-olds should be given the right to vote right now.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806028003283173579) If you think "minors don't have enough reason to vote, so it's okay not to give them the right to vote", in other words, "it's okay to take away the right to vote from people who don't have enough reason to vote, instead of one vote per person equally So I think from the perspective of "consistency" that you should stop saying things as if you are equal.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806021002851487891) Surprisingly, not many people equated digital democracy with online voting. I noticed a lot of people assuming "one person, one vote," so I added a case study of Quadratic Voting in Taiwan and a discussion of strategy resistance.

>  Encyclopædia Brittanica, encyclopedia encyclopedia, encyclopedia - Tyranny of the majority - Tyranny exercised in the name of the majority under a democratic political system. Majority rule (→ majority principle), the constitutive principle of modern democracy (→ democracy), is the deprivation of the rights of the minority (→ minority rights) by the majority, as Alexis de Tocqueville saw it...

Too good to be true.



> [S_kuni_official](https://x.com/S_kuni_official/status/1805971585905615255) At first, I was skeptical that we would get along with each other with such an age difference. I was skeptical at first, but after talking to him, I was surprised at how much we got along. We are not in denial about the current metropolitan government, but rather we are in agreement in that we have a clear idea of what is to be evaluated and what is to be criticized, and we are constructive in our criticisms.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806349793201143926) Thematic polls like #MinorPolls should also serve as input data for opinion cluster visualizations like #Polis, which I've been experimenting with lately!

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1806350642128240787) This kind of clustering can be done if we gather 10~30 opinions on one subject in this minor poll, and LLM can moderate and develop the discussion. LLMs can moderate and develop the discussion. We are getting closer to the realization of #digitaldemocracy.

Maybe it works similarly to the way the floor gets cleared when you try to move the Roomba.

> [yuyawatase](https://x.com/yuyawatase/status/1805155914338742397) During the election period, candidates are only allowed to distribute a limited number of documents in real life with a sticker called a "certificate". This is because the election should not be unfair due to differences in capital strength.
> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805834562641215514) I didn't realize what they were talking about until I saw them actually putting the stickers on by hand. I thought that the sticker-pasted papers handed out during the relevant speeches are rare items with a limited number of copies.



> [hrjn](https://x.com/hrjn/status/1805802841560563834) #Digital Democracy has evolved so much that if a governor says, "What Senator XX says is in his interest, not the will of the people. If he says "This is the evidence of the will of the people", it will be a singularity of democracy.

> [nishio](https://x.com/nishio/status/1805808978909077764) The Polis experiment so far has been to have the AI create a clean statement and then have humans vote on it, and once the new human post is also cleaned up by the AI, it is then published, but I wonder if we could try the direct I'd like to try it on the theme of "updating democracy" in the form that a human writes it and it is published immediately.

>  Fandom and Exercise Democracy - Hal Seki's Scrapbox
>  The interesting thing about fandom is that, first of all, it does not exist only to consume in a unified way. In other words, while being consumers, they also exist as producers through actions such as sending out information about their own guesses, making goods, and creating derivative works. This is similar to the structure of social media, where everyone is both a receiver and a transmitter. However, since the object of the promotion is clearly a product, it would be an infringement of copyright and portrait rights if you create a secondary product without permission.

- > [rrr_kgknk](https://x.com/rrr_kgknk/status/1716817691426906234) Shigeki Uno and Megumi Wakabayashi, "Experimental Democracy," is a ballyhoo good book and highly recommended. The dynamism of getting a lot of people together to do something experimental is visualized in a dialogue that is academic but also has the savagery of the zaino (which is what experimental is). The company is interesting, and that interest became quite clear to me after reading this book.


> [takashikiso](https://x.com/takashikiso/status/1806126062465847630) Unfortunately, the reason for Renho's loss is that Renho is hated by the female demographic far more than she imagined, and conversely, Yuriko has strong support among that demographic! I guess.
>  Since Yuriko has won by a landslide with half of the voters, there is no way she can beat Yuriko in the current situation where the remaining attributes are divided among the three main candidates, including Ishimaru, who is surprisingly under consideration.
> [takashikiso](https://x.com/takashikiso/status/1806127744956457145) Yuriko is also quite "cynical," if not as cynical as Renho, and especially when elections start to be involved, she sends out criticism of her opponents at key points, but she is always more cynical than the fierce Renho. Yuriko's sarcasm is on the surface more gentle than that of the always fierce Renho. This may be the reason for the difference in their ratings (especially among female voters). Well, Renho's rust is on her own. She has to give up.
