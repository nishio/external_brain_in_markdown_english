The following is a summary and organization of the real-time discussion among viewers on Scrapbox (now Cosense) on the day of the lecture (June 6, 2024). We have supplemented the context and removed as much of the informal and verbose language as possible so that later readers who did not watch the lecture itself can use it as a "record of the reception of the lecture" to show what viewpoints and interests the recipients had and what they received at the time.

# Points visible from discussions during real-time viewing
.

## Empathy and rediscovery of long-term value
.
The fact that "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" is still in print after five years reaffirmed the viewers' appreciation for a book that has proven its long-term value: the intellectual production skills in place at the time of its publication in 2018 are still useful in the LLM era of 2024, and the book's emphasis on the "learning cycle" and "autonomous and the importance of "learning cycles" and "autonomous selection of learning objects," as indicated by this book, have been reaffirmed.

## Knowledge accumulation and association using Scrapbox (Cosense)
.
Attention was drawn to an example of an author accumulating 20,000 pages (equivalent to 60 books) of content on Scrapbox.
- Viewers appreciated the asynchronous reference to "my past knowledge and thoughts" and the ability to follow links to new discoveries.
- Sympathy was expressed for the concept of "social triggers" and "interactions with past selves" that can reinvigorate knowledge and create a cycle of intellectual production.

## interest in electronic KJ method (Kozaneba)
.
Unlike the paper KJ method, the advantages of using Kozaneba, a digital tool, included "free rearrangement," "zoom function," and "structural editing with lines showing relationships," and viewers were convinced that these features made the information organization and convergence process more efficient.
- The reference to the example of a workshop where "multiple people organize information at the same time" also drew attention to the possibility of collaborative intellectual production.

## Fusion of LLM and Personal Knowledge Base/RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Viewers showed strong interest in the practical example of combining a personal Scrapbox with LLM (ChatGPT).
- The use of RAGs to provide answers to specific needs from a personalized knowledge base is recognized as a useful measure to move away from "commoditized LLM.
- Viewers empathized with the potential for personalized knowledge use and differentiation, and envisioned an image of "your own intellectual assistant" in the LLM era.

## development of summarization techniques and nonlinear reading
.
Viewers responded favorably to tools like the Fractal Reader that present summaries at different granularities, and to the new reading experience that fast LLM summaries bring.
- The fact that readers can access information with a "start with the broad strokes" as a watchword, varying the level of detail according to their interests, is highly regarded as an appropriate reading model in this age of information overload.
- The possibility of "collaborative reading," in which multiple people use Scrapbox to read while discussing the book, and the LLM's interactively assisted reading experience were also seen as extensions of the traditional act of "reading a book.

## Role of LLM to divergent and convergent thinking
.
Viewers agreed with the point that ideation (divergence) by LLM is easy, but the final convergence and structuring of ideas requires ingenuity.
- Expectations were expressed for LLM context window expansion and for convergent thinking support in combination with the KJ method.
- In the future, the image of LLMs and humans collaboratively "arranging" thoughts "like a bonsai tree" was shared within the audience.

## Reactions to Questions and Answers
.
During the Q&A session, viewers also expressed interest in specific themes such as "output that emphasizes substance over appearance," "how to handle confidential and public information," and "how to bridge the gap in the ability to use LLM in education.
- These are understood not as "summaries to a book" but as practical topics on how to operationalize intellectual production in the LLM era on a daily and practical basis.

# general suggestions
.
Discussions among viewers helped deepen their understanding of the lecture's aim, "Redefining the Art of Intellectual Production in the LLM Era. The way viewers instantly shared their knowledge with each other on Scrapbox, reinforcing and developing the content of the lecture, is exactly the place where the "new model of intellectual production" presented in this book and in the lecture is being put into practice.

For later readers, these conversation log summaries provide examples of how the talks were received and how "community intellectual production, where knowledge is shared, diffused, and reinterpreted," is possible. These are valuable documents that go beyond mere reactions to the lectures and convey the vitality and diversity of the field where tools and methodologies such as LLM, Scrapbox, Kozaneba, and Fractal Reader are creating new forms of intellectual production.
