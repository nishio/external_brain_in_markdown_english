- I realized that the diagram (1) and the diagram (2), which I often draw, represent the same thing in different ways.
- I think we should name the diagram first.
    - (1)
            - A representation of [[Knowledge Network]].
                - [[knowledge network notation]]
                - I don't wear this tag too often, I use it without explanation, thinking it's a rather "natural expression".
                - Circles are knowledge and concepts, lines are relationships
        - Earlier ones are [[Rootless Knowledge]] (2014)
                - [[Pyramid notation of knowledge]] and related [[Above is abstract and below is concrete.]] features and so on, but often without ups and downs to express what that doesn't express.
        - Recently painted
            - [[digging until you figure out what you don't know]].
            - [[books and digs]]
    - (2)
        - [[gray translucent meaning diagram]].
            - Very recently named.
            - In the process of [[Concept Map of the Plurality book]] → [[Concept Map Study Group]], I looked back at the explanation in the study group of "[[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]]" and thought that the notation invented in the process of this explanation has been used for a long time since then. I thought that there should be a name for this method of expression, since it has been in use for a long period of time since then.
        - It was produced in [[Study Session 3 on "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"]] (2022) as a result of considering how it could be expressed for explanation in a study session.

The logic of this equivalence is explained in (4B4) [[Relation or relata]] in "Experiencing Processes and Imagining Meanings
- Explained using the [[Dark Thin Circle Diagram]] invented at this time: [["relationship between A and B" and "aspects of A created by B" are the same]].
- The network notation of knowledge interprets meaning narrowly, while the gray translucent meaning diagram interprets it broadly.

(3)
- In the situation of reading a book, the author is trying to acquire concept S, which the author assumes the reader does not have, by creating aspects by concepts A, B, and C, which the author assumes the reader does have.
    - Contrary to expectations, readers may not have A
        - Those readers don't understand s
            - By virtue of books being finite, there has to be a disconnect somewhere.
            - As an author, I feel it's the reader's responsibility to have the prerequisite knowledge.
            - However, there is no easy way for readers to know what the author considers to be prerequisite knowledge, so it is true that some readers may become angry because they do not understand the book after buying it.
                - It's not the reader's fault because it's not explained.
            - It's also something the author has no way of resolving, so the author is not at fault.
        - Readers should look into A, the author thinks.
            - You don't have to look it up, but in that case you should accept it as a given that you won't get an S.
            - Some readers think, "I won't pay the cost of looking up A, but let them get S, and the author should pay the cost of that."
            - Well, author's point of view, I don't think I'd pay that.
        - I was thinking about this area in "[[digging until you understand what you don't know]]" and "[[books and digging]]"

    - The reader self-identifies as having an A, but there's a disconnect with what the author's A refers to.
        - This is tricky.
        - There are cases where the reader is wrong, cases where the author is wrong, and cases where neither is wrong.
        - It's a case of the reader being wrong, and he thinks he knows the concept, so he doesn't want to look it up.
        - The process of resolving this is depicted in "[[Development of discomfort]]" after "[[What you feel when you read the books]]".
            - At this time, knowledge network notation
            - It's 2019, so the gray translucent meaning diagram hasn't been invented yet.
        - I believe the only way to resolve this is by noticing the discrepancy and seeking consistency.
            - This relates to what was written in "[[knowledge consistency]]"

At this time I believe this is related to [[CIRCUMLOCUTION]], but need confirmation
