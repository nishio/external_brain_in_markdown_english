- Abuse of power is a situational phenomenon in which the reward system of the brain becomes dominant all at once rather than a "personality issue.
- The more unfamiliar you are, the more [[self-protection]] and [[desire for approval]] become intertwined and accelerate the outburst.
- Institutional brakes + psychological education + gradual granting of authority - these three pillars will greatly curb excessive use.

Disruption of the action approach/control balance
- The moment they feel empowered, the BAS (reward-seeking system) in the brain is activated and the BIS (self-control system) is suppressed. As a result, impulsive and selfish behavior increases.
- Suddenly you stop imagining [[the other person's point of view]]."

Parvenu (rise and fall) effect
- Newcomers tend to exaggerate and apply the norms of the existing group in order to show that they are the legitimate ones.
- Unnecessarily harsh punishments and overemphasis on rules

Experience and [[lack of]] metacognition
- Lack of [[governance experience]] and meta-awareness of [[the psychological impact of power]].
- Prefer to solve problems by force and omit dialogue and consensus building

Power hallucinations" and reduced empathy
- The small successes gained in power become dopamine rewards, reinforcing "all-powerfulness" and indifference to others.
- Monopolizing credit and undervaluing the contributions of subordinates

Unconstrained and synchronized pressure in the environment
- When a brakeman is absent, those around him or her will sympathize and encourage abuse.
- The Stanford Prison Experiment is a symbol of this.
- Escalating orders, arbitrary penalties

Overcompensation for identity insecurity
- He emphasized an authoritative attitude to counteract fears that he was inherently unqualified to govern.
- Target creation and elimination, excessive formalism
