*1415252780* I will give a lecture at Nagoya University.
I will be giving a lecture at the Nagoya University Student Branch of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers. The theme is "How to learn" and will be based on my keynote speech at PyConJP and my lecture at the Nada School Saturday Lecture, but with a focus on the majority of participants, who are students in the information field.

- Date: 11/10 (Mon.) 17:00 - 18:30
- Place: Room 362, 3F, IB Building South, Nagoya University

You do not have to be a student at Nagoya University to participate. If you are interested, please join us.
