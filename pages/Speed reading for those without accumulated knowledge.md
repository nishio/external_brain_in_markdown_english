title: "Speed reading for those without accumulated knowledge"
---

- In [[How to give knowledge to those who lack knowledge]], we talked about how to convey the necessary knowledge X of [[piling up]] to those who lack [[Accumulated Knowledge]], and how to support the knowledge just barely conveyed with minimal piling up in the story. The story was told.

What happens when a book written in that style is read at a speed that allows Mr. B, who has accumulated knowledge in the field, and Mr. C, who does not, to pick up only part of what is written, respectively?

Mr. B knows most of the information, so he can unconsciously skip over it and acquire only the crucial knowledge X in a short time.
So it is appropriate for Mr. B to read that way.

The problem is Mr. C. Because he does not have a pile of knowledge, he does not have the ability to determine which knowledge is important, so he randomly chooses appropriate knowledge. Since this style of book is not tightly stacked from the bottom, most of the knowledge will be knowledge floating in the air when randomly selected.

The amount of information acquired from a book is about the same for both B and C. However, Mr. C has a high probability of placing it in an inappropriate location.

With Mr. C's reading method, the boxes of knowledge just line up flat, and no matter how many you make, they do not accumulate. Accumulation is a different activity from mere reading.

>  [[information gathering]] is the image of collecting boxes. Here, information is compared to boxes. Information gathering is the process of collecting and arranging many boxes. However, even if you only collect information in large quantities, the boxes will only be arranged in a flat line and will not be piled up.

Another expression: [[Knowledge Network]] is not built.
