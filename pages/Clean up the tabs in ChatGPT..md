title: "Clean up the tabs in ChatGPT."
---

Let's say you have a discussion with ChatGPT about how to do something like this technically, and you come up with some information that might be useful.
- But suppose we are not in a situation to do that implementation right now.
- On the other hand, let's say you don't have enough to organize a long log and put it in Cosense.
    - (Note: This place is not technically correct to begin with.
        - This log should be recorded as an individual's activity without any manipulation, and should come up as, for example, "We discussed this kind of thing the other day, right?
        - ChatGPT did not even allow searches from the logs until 2024-10, so any knowledge you wanted to reuse should not have had to be recompiled in Cosense!

In this situation, I kept tabs open to "try it later," and this caused a lot of problems, and I had to log in every time I ran out of sessions.

prompt: just a brief summary to note the discussion in this log

Now write to Cosense and close the tab.
- Tabs that don't even motivate me to do this are unimportant.

Unlike search, it is better to be connected by links

I've cleared out the tabs.
