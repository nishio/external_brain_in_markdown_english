title: "regard a group of people as individuals"

> [cicada3301_kig](https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1783606292403351824) [[ASD]] is not good at thinking about "[[acquaintances of acquaintances]]", so they seem to regard a group as an individual, For example, when they tell something to a hospital, they think that if they tell one nurse, the information will be instantly shared throughout the hospital. The hospital is an individual.
>  So, in writing a novel, if the structure is such that "in a harem where the main character is in love with an angel and a demon, the angel and the demon are not on good terms", the "angel" and "demon" are treated as individuals, so even ASD can understand this.
>  But it gradually becomes more difficult when it becomes something like "there is a devil's minion mixed in with the angels, and he is making a love triangle with another acquaintance against the main character.
- [[Tell one and they will all know.]]
    - For example, with elementary and middle school students, they incorrectly assume that what they say to one teacher is also communicated to the other teachers.
    - It's not so much whether or not you have ASD, but rather "each person knows differently" is a costly thing to think about, and kids make mistakes.
    - I think there's a difference in the speed of this growth, where you learn not to make mistakes in the process of growing up.

>  When "acquaintances of acquaintances" come into play and the circle breaks down and acquaintances cheat each other on their own, it is no longer a worldview for ASD.

>  Is this another ASD trait?
>  Like "you guys" in the old 2ch.
