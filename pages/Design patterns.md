Design patterns
- > Design patterns were patterns that are observed in many programs, and they are named. Making design patterns is exactly creating a language. By making a language, the human can call a structure "a mediator pattern" instead of call that "a structure that one thing mediates all interactions of many things instead of allowing them to interact with each other." By associating symbols with concepts, the cost if thinking decrease.
    - Design patterns were patterns that are observed in many programs.
    - They are named after they are discovered. It is a process of making a language.
    - The language associates symbols with concepts. So, we can call a structure of program "a mediator pattern" instead of call the structure "a structure that one thing mediates all interactions of many things instead of allowing them to interact with each other." The language reduces the cost os thinking.
