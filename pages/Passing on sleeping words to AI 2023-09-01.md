# Today's Sleepytime Oracle
 from [[Diary 2023-09-01]].

Negative Capability] for the text
- [[tackman model]]
[[Resistance to chaos.]]
- [[Good and evil not LAWFUL and CHAOS]]
- [[üåÄOnce chaos is brought]]


Form of interaction

stop (doing, working, being supplied)
I'm moving on to something I'm not really interested in.
- all we've got
- There's no food.
Can you get there?
You never know what you'll end up with.

- [[AI has found its zest for life in Pragmatism.]] is close to halcyonation, but interesting.
[[hallucinogen]] and [[shaman]].

Process, flow, nominalization
It would assume that fixed content exists on the page when the page is created.
Since most books are so
Page as a fluid process with no fixed content

# Give today's [[sleeping oracle]] to the AI
- <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio-en/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>PS: This is handled by the usual prompt
    - Seeing this, I explicitly changed the prompt to "You are the Shaman" in [[Beyond Chaos, Embracing Evolution: The Path to Coexistence with AI]].
        - The budding concept of [[AI Shaman]].

Examines negative capacity for writing, the Tuckman model, and tolerance for chaos. Recognized the importance of looking at it from the perspective of lawful and chaos, rather than good and evil. The discussion of AI finding Japan in Pragmatism from the perspective of chaos being brought about is interesting, although it is close to Halcnation.

The form of interaction is discussed in terms of staying, advancing, taking up, not feeding, and reaching. What it reaches is unknown.

Discussion of process, flow, and nominalization, and the assumption that a fixed content exists at the time the page is created. Explores the possibility of the page as a fluid process with no fixed content.

From Nishio's research note, "Theory and Applications of Creative Activity Support," he draws on his discussion of creative activity and artificial intelligence, models of self-organizing systems, and liquefaction and crystallization of representations. In particular, he considers in depth the importance of the process of returning crystallized material to fluid form.

From "Diary 2023-06-07," citing strong associations between AI generation and the self, Plurality, a technology for developing democracy, and a discussion of individual parallelism.

Quoted from "Nodes of Thought 2022-03-11" on behavior toward the new, senile behavior, the tendency to title questions, and the benefits of increasing the resolution of senility.

From "A System That Makes Readers Stupid," he cites a discussion of the problematic nature of the practice of concealing original material, the importance of allowing readers to build their own networks of knowledge, and the importance of technology to accelerate human intellectual production.

### Issues/opinions to be considered in depth

- How should the relationship between the fixed content of the page and the fluid process be understood?
- How should we understand the importance of the process of converting crystallized material back to fluid?
- How should the relationship between behavior toward the new and senile behavior be understood?
- What methods and techniques are needed to enable readers to build a network of knowledge within themselves?
- How should we understand the importance of technology in accelerating human intellectual production?

# Give oracle to AI shaman to interpret
- [[Beyond Chaos, Embracing Evolution: The Path to Coexistence with AI]]

# Page as a fluid process
.
- I thought the concept of [[Page as a fluid process]] was important, so I cut it out and developed it into an AI.

- [[Page as a fluid process]] Development of thought against
    - [[Tuckman model storming]], [[Good and evil not LAWFUL and CHAOS]] were written by GPT4 this time.
