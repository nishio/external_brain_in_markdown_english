There are ecological terms and [[political philosophy]] terms. We're talking about the latter here.
- [Panarchy(1860): full text in Japanese｜R.Shinmi](https://note.com/ricksh/n/n274ed93b311c)
- [[Panarchy]].

simply put
    - [[democracy]] requires [[competitiveness]] to function
    - For example, a [[two-party]] style in which two major parties advocating different policies fight each other in elections.
- However, if the age-by-age population ratio collapses, etc., the choice is lost and "[[a]] meaningless election
        - [[silver democracy]] etc.
- To improve this situation, it would be nice if each individual could have the right to choose "the government that governs him".
this means

The "right to choose your government" sounds absurd, but in a work environment where, for example, [[remote work]] has flourished, choosing the [[municipality]] where you live has become a choice independent of your job.
Thus, the [[cost of travel]] is reduced and [[mobile voting]] is facilitated by [[virtualization]] [[digitization]] of various things.


> In an 1860 article, de Puydt first proposed the idea of panarchy: a political philosophy that emphasizes each individual's right to freely choose (join and leave) the jurisdiction of any governments they choose, without being forced to move from their current locale. A proponent of laissez-faire economics, he wrote that "governmental competition" would let "as many regularly competing governments as have ever been conceived and will ever be invented" exist simultaneously and detailed how such a system would be implemented. As David M. Hart writes: "Governments would become political churches, only having jurisdiction over their congregations who had elected to become members." Three similar ideas are "Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions" (FOCJ) advocated by Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger, "multigovernment" advocated by Le Grand E. Day and others, and "meta-utopia" from Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia.

- (DeepL)[[de Puyd]] first proposed the idea of panarchy in an 1860 article. Panarchy is a political philosophy that emphasizes the right of each individual to freely choose (join or leave) the government jurisdiction of his choice without being forced to move from where he currently lives. An advocate of laissez-faire economics, he wrote that "[[intergovernmental competition]]" would allow for the simultaneous existence of "as many regularly competing governments as have ever been conceived and will ever be invented," and detailed how such a system would be implemented. As David M. Hart wrote, "Government would become a political church, with jurisdiction over only elected congregations. Similar ideas include "[[functional overlapping competing jurisdictions]]" (FOCJ) proposed by Swiss economists Bruno Frei and Rainer Eichenberger, "[[multigovernment]]" by Le Grand E. Day and others, and "[[anarchy, state, utopia]]" in Robert Nozick's "[[a meta-utopia]]".

(Context) (In response to the story about taking notes at [[Namera Conference 4]]) Perhaps because that place is a hive of early adopters, there are many "things that I didn't catch in real time because my understanding hasn't caught up" and I can understand them months later, so I take copious notes. So I take copious notes.
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1777235496977973571/quick_promote_web/intro) In 2022 [[rickshinmi]] translated Panarchy, and I looked at it at the time and didn't really understand it. In 2023, I found out a little bit about it and put the translation on Wikipedia DeepL. In 2024, I heard about meta-utopia and thought it sounded like Panarchy, so I looked back and found that he had already written about meta-utopia.

- The principles of political economy, "[[free competition]]" and "[[laissez faire]] ([[government non-intervention]])," should be applied to politics.
- Individuals should be free to choose their preferred form of governance, and the state should allow competition for each form of governance.
- With the freedom to choose the form of governance, individuals can choose the government that best suits them. If dissatisfied, they can switch to another form of governance.
- If the [[principle of competition]] of governance works, governments will seek to improve the quality of their services to meet the needs of their citizens and to make governance as simple and economical as possible.
- This allows for peaceful and gradual transformation of the political system without [[revolution]] or [[violent political change]].
- In a society where various forms of governance coexist, the best form of governance will eventually prevail and become universally adopted.

The novel idea of introducing the principle of free competition into politics is proposed to promote [[better government services]] and [[greater government efficiency]] while respecting [[individual liberty]] and [[diversity]].
