The following is a brief summary of some of the conversations between [[Degin Sod Zabi]] and [[Gilen Zabi]] in the movie version "[[Mobile Suit Gundam III: Meguri Ai Uchu Hen]]".

Conversation Summary
Degin] asks [[Guillen]], "Do you know [[Adolf Hitler]]`? [Adolf Hitler. Degin then describes [Hitler] as "[a] dictator, a man who couldn't read the world" and declares to Gillen, "You are [Hitler's] tail. In other words, Degin critically points out Guillen's attitude of selecting human beings into superior species based on Hitler's dictatorial ideology and aiming for control by the Zabi family dictatorship.`

Difference between the TV version and the movie version
In the original TV version of "Mobile Suit Gundam," the last line of this conversation was "Hitler was defeated," but in the movie version, it was replaced with "Hitler was killed by his own people. It is believed that this was not merely a change in phrasing, but was intended to add a darker nuance to the story, as the dictatorship collapses due to internal strife and betrayal.

Background and Intent
This scene has been passed down among fans as a dialogue with political and ideological weight that transcends the boundaries of a children's animation. When Degin calls Guillen "Hitler's tail," it suggests that his ideology is as dangerous as that of past dictators and foreshadows later developments (Guillen's tragic fate).
