title: "The Trap of Extracted Writing"

- Pitfalls when reading a book and doing [[extract]] or subtracting [[marker]].
- There is no pitfall when you [[output]] what you [[experience]] as language.
- When you read a book and output it, [[input]] itself is already in the form of language.
- Instead of inputting it and thinking about it and outputting it in your own mind, you simply work on cutting out parts of the input.
- I feel like I'm doing something useful, but I'm actually [[acting without thinking]].
- I think it's cooler to have a sentence cut out of a book than a sentence spun out of my own thoughts, and I think that's a good thing.
- I don't think hard, I just kind of marker off sentences that have a cool vibe with the words and feel like I've accomplished something.
    - [[inferior copy]] only.
- If you don't train yourself [[spin a sentence]], you'll always be nothing but a degraded copy of someone else's content.
