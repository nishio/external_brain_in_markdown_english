The naive vector similarity method separates English and Japanese.

For me personally, this is a big problem, so I'm not very satisfied with a simple embedded vector similarity
- But very few people use both English and Japanese, so you don't have to worry about it.

But when I went to bed and woke up, I felt like, "Why don't we machine translate every English sentence into Japanese and load it into a vector index?
- Better than making it into a vector and then thinking "how do I paste together the spaces that are far apart"?

- In [[Plurality Japanese translation]], the language is now included in the vector index without separating the languages.
- [/plurality-japanese/Plurality Vector Search](https://scrapbox.io/plurality-japanese/Plurality Vector Search)
- I feel like I can't provide user value with that.
    - If it is Japanese who use it, the query is also usually in Japanese
    - But when I search for idioms, I get Chinese hits.
- If so, it would be better to load the "Japanese" side of "other language -> Japanese" into the search index.
    - Then, turn the arrow in the opposite direction and read the original text after the Japanese hits if you want to.

The association of two chunks by machine translation is a kind of "link"
- Hits by vector search are loose links
- Compare with explicit human links in Scrapbox
    - Link meaning "same content, different language."
    - Scrapbox link to "Human Associations" link
