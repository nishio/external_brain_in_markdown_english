- I would like to have a better format for storing knowledge.
    - I was talking with [[Tomoya Tachikawa]] about it, and he suggested that it might be a more [[subjective]] [[chatbot]].
        - 2023-08-25 [[More subjective chatbots]] are becoming a reality
        - [[20191011 Tachikawa Nishio chat notes]]
    - Seeing Masui-san's play of putting everything in Gyazo
        - Then it's just a "thumbnail view of the page" and "edit and search".
        - I think there might be something one step further.
- The most primitive form of subjectivity is [[preferences]].
    - This is a binary classifier

    - [[The form of knowledge representation must be updated]]
    - Scrapbox is on a pretty good track.
    - However, "[[Update of knowledge representation format]]" and "knowledge representation format must be updated" are not common keywords.
    - The problem is where the keywords are strings.
        - "Knowledge representation format must be updated" and "knowledge representation format update" have disparate string-like commonalities.
        - ("knowledge", "representation format", "update")
    - 2023-08-25  [[Connect with Vector Search]]

- There is a hint that the keyword may be "[[Stock of associations]]" but it has not been solidified yet.
    - We can now use search to find non-keywords (e.g. documents) from keywords, what we need is to find keywords from non-keywords, right?
