title: "hyper-organized notebook"
---

I used this notebook until 2010.
My wife recommended me to switch to [[TRAVELER'S notebook]], so it is no longer used.
Then it was shoved in my emergency bag, but in the summer of 2018 I asked, "Is it appropriate to have it here?" I was asked, so I took it out and looked at it.

Many fans are against the shape of A4 folded into four, and the schedule column is long horizontally on a weekly basis, but I didn't have that many schedules at that time (I put stickies to hide schedules that I couldn't show).

I used to carry [[Leverage memo]] around and review it, taking advantage of the fact that it could hold a printout in A4, but when I finally got to 8 sheets, I started to think that this was impossible!

- It's impossible to keep a first army note 8p mom.
- Too many to review and should be separated once they are reviewed.
- The first military note is not only about ideas, but also about information
- Full prompt, backward chaining
