- I used to write [[Task Memo]] in [[Rhodia]].
    - It is in the breast pocket for quick access, so you can write as soon as you think of it.
    - But A7 size
        - There is a 5mm square and I write 5mm letters.
        - If you write a lot, it will be small letters written in small pieces.
            - Or it would be multiple copies.
        - not good
    - My wife says she writes on A5 size paper, about 1cm square.
- Since we have the iPad, we should make ample use of its wide screen to organize tasks.
    - Can write larger than Rhodia
    - Unlike paper, it can be moved and copied and pasted after writing.
- have a go
    - Write anything without separating it from the task.
    - INBOX equivalent
    - Every day it shrinks a little bit.
    - Every day we change the placement two-dimensionally, or a new sprout grows.
    - interesting
