- "Tokyo-based" in 0.1
    - > Cybozu, a Tokyo-based global software company.
    - I think "Tokyo-based" is not important
    - How about: "Cybozu, a global software company that provides web-based groupware services."
    - Or, If you intended to show the author is in east-asian culture, "Cybozu, a global software company founded in Japan"

- "articulate" in 0.1.2
- > I was able to translate what I was doing unconsciously into words
- > I was able to articulate what I was doing unconsciously
- The word "articulate" looks a little difficult for non-native

- "there is an opposite opinion." in 0.1.2
    - Sould it be "there are some opposite opinions." ?
