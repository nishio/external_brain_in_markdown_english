>  It's important to be strong, but you need to [[tear]] too.
>  [[You can't do anything with a dry, parched heart.]]
>  I can't feel anything.
>  [[Why and how do people lock away their true feelings?]]
>  [[What you can do, what you want to do, one step at a time.]]
>  I love you for not being influenced by the programmed way of life.
>  I'll follow you everywhere, my hand, forever and ever, I'll never let you go.
