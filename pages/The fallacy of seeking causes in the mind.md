- Fact: The divorce rate (number of divorces per 1,000 population) in Japan decreased by about 15% in the late 1980s.
- Why is this?

- I tend to give explanations that seek causes in the mind.
- In fact, divorce rates have been rising for all generations, and the baby boomers were just in the early 1980's with the highest divorce rates in the early 30's.
