This article is written by [[Taiyo Hamada]], a member of our management team. The main points are as follows
- The event "DeSci Tokyo 2024 x Funding the Commons 2024" will be held in Tokyo on July 24 and 25, 2024. This is an international conference on [[distributed science]] ([[DeSci]]) and [[digital public goods]].
- DeSci is a new movement to democratize scientific research through the use of [[decentralized technologies]] such as blockchain.
- Funding the Commons, on the other hand, is an initiative to support the development of digital public goods such as [[open source software]].
- This event will discuss the future of research and digital public goods, including [[open science]], [[research automation]], and [[mechanism design]], under the theme of addressing social issues such as population decline.
- DeSci Tokyo's mission is to "[[explore]] the future of research.
    - In the Japanese research field, issues such as a lack of human resources and delays in technology transfer have been pointed out.
    - DeSci Tokyo aims to solve these issues by automating research, utilizing data, and introducing new R&D processes while connecting with the world.
    - DeSci Tokyo offers three forms:.
        - Building a [worldwide virtual lab
        - Support for [[distributed data sharing]] and [patent distribution infrastructure
        - Promotion of [support system for exploratory research
- Challenges in the research area in Japan: decrease in PhDs, decline in international performance, delay in technology transfer, environment for drug discovery, lack of AI personnel, etc.
- The event will feature lectures, panel discussions, and workshops by national and international researchers and practitioners, and will be an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the nature of research and digital public goods. Ticket sales and sponsorship opportunities are also available.

[Shinya Mori's Blog | Bridging Crypto and Economics｜Funding the Commons Tokyo](https://paragraph.xyz/@morleysheen/funding-the-commons-tokyo)
This article is a discussion of the relationship between [[crypto]] and funding public goods by [[Shinya Mamoru]], a managing member of Funding the Commons Tokyo. The main points are as follows
1. Mamoru is active in the crypto area and is conducting research and development on blockchain solutions for [[Public Goods Funding]] mechanisms and [[collective decision-making]] methods.
2. not only are cryptos relevant as [[donation platforms]], but [[DAOs]] ([[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]]) are also closely related to public goods. DAOs are characterized by having their own treasury and funding projects of a public nature.
- DAO is essentially [[on-chain governance]] ([[automatic execution by a program]]) rather than a community. This is an experiment to solve [[human coordination problems]].
4. crypto projects have experimented with overcoming various human coordination problems, but now face challenges such as [[fake account problems]], [[collusion]], [[lack of sustained funding]], [[indifferent]], and [[lack of impact evaluation]].
5. these challenges are not crypto-specific, but cross-disciplinary issues that cut across technology, economics, civic participation, the commons, etc. Knowledge outside of crypto is essential.
6. "Funding the Commons" is a common language for those involved in [[Public Goods Funding]] inside and outside the crypt, a place where we can understand each other's expertise and complement each other.
7. Mamoru would like to introduce an example of Public Goods Funding implementation in crypto at Funding the Commons Tokyo to stimulate and promote mutual understanding within and outside of crypto.

[Two intense days of pioneering the future of digital public goods - Funding the Commons Tokyo 2024｜Hal Seki](https://note.com/hal_sk/n/n4768c58d379b)
This article was written by [[Haruyuki Seki]], President of [[Code for Japan]], about his expectations for "Funding the Commons Tokyo 2024" (FtC) to be held in Tokyo in July. The main points of the article are as follows
1. FtC is a conference to explore new ways to address the fundamental challenge of underinvestment in [[digital public goods]] ([[open source software]], [[open data]], [[open AI models]], etc.).
- Interest in and investment in digital public goods is low in Japan, and Code for Japan has struggled to secure ongoing operational funding.
3. FtC will bring together stakeholders from various sectors to create a new [[funding model]] that utilizes open source technology. The goal is to move away from the traditional model of relying on [[government grants]] and [[private donations]] and to create a sustainable model.
4. the development of an ecosystem to support public goods through FtC would broaden the scope of [[civic tech]] activities and allow for large, challenging new [[public goods (i.e. goods or services such as parks or highways)]] projects.
- Although there are many challenges in investing in digital public goods, they can make a significant contribution to [[solving global issues]] such as [[SDGs]]. Japan has an opportunity to demonstrate use cases to the world.
6. Mr. Seki is also planning an investment fund for digital public goods at Code for Japan, and he hopes that FtC will help increase interest in and momentum for digital public goods in Japan.
7. FtC will be attended by many important national and international public goods thinkers and practitioners. Open source professionals, researchers, and web3 stakeholders are invited to participate.

This article was written by [[Shunsuke Takagi]] ([[tkgshn]]), one of the people involved, on the enthusiasm and background for the "Funding the Commons (FtC) Tokyo" to be held in Tokyo in July 2024. The main points are as follows
1. FtC is a forum for people around the world to consider [[social implementation]] of [[governing technology]] being experimented with crypto technology. It is organized by [[Protocol Labs]] and has been held around the world since November 2021.
- The purpose of holding the event in Japan is to coincide with EDCON and to present a "revitalization vision" from Tokyo, which is facing a declining population and other challenges.
3. expect participation from those interested in the compatibility of crypto and public goods, as well as those interested in topics such as [[AI alignment]], [[OSS funding]] and sustainability. Also [[depopulation]] and [[d/acc]] will be discussed.
4. expected participants include developers, designers, blockchain developers, charitable foundations, academics, artists, OSS officials, government officials, and public goods funding project officials.
5. there are many ways to participate, including attending conferences, speaking, volunteering, sponsoring, sharing learning and translating. Questions can be discussed with a member of the management team.
6. venue is the United Nations University; July-August will be a time when not only Tokyo but also the Asian region will be in the spotlight, and major partnerships are being planned.
7. the author, tkgshn, previously started a [[Govtech]] startup called [[Civichat]] and is involved in FtC because of that experience.
Overall, the content conveys the anticipation and enthusiasm for holding a unique conference in Japan that connects crypto and public goods.

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1788570569572864269) I've put together an AI summary of all the articles written by the four management members, and if you're interested in mechanism design to support OSS and other digital public goods, just this summary I hope you read it and think "there are people trying to make the world a better place!"
> [HiroTHamadaJP](https://twitter.com/HiroTHamadaJP/status/1788573289335668964) Nishio-san, are you the best person ever?
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1788574566278889957) It's hard to try to talk about all of them because of the "diverse aspects" even though I thought I had lined them up for all four of them. I think it is correct that each of the four wrote an article. It seems that which explanation of the four people will stick differently depending on who reads it. That's why I also focused on "OSS", "public goods", and "mechanism design" in my own tweets.
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1788575050318372983) Everyone has their own vision, but the common language is funding the commons
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1788577987090436215) This line is movingly good, I'll add it.


> [hal_sk](https://twitter.com/hal_sk/status/1788352311229915491) Here is the answer as to why I have been committed to crypto-related activities for the past few years.
>  I would like to see a wide range of public stakeholders come to Funding the Commons in July, not just crypto people.
> [MorleySheen](https://twitter.com/MorleySheen/status/1788396478572249466) Last April, I met with Seki-san and connected the dots ("what I originally wanted to do" and "my activities in the crypt").
>  The Merge of Public and Crypto!

> I was in charge of curating the program and speakers for the second day (Public Goods Day) of the conference, which started when I met David at ETH Denver and we hit it off. I was in charge of the program and speaker curation on the second day (Public Goods Day).
>  ・When selecting speakers, we were very careful about context. How to make it contextual rather than conventional.
>  The emphasis was not on inviting "Big Name" speakers from overseas to give speeches, but rather on having them engage in proper discussions.
>  People I have met in various places have worked on the event, and several paths have led to this number of speakers (Audrey Tang, Yuriko Koike, Takahiro Yasuno, etc...).
>  I would like you to continue to take selfies with celebrities, not only with them, but also with your own hands.
>  ・Ticket cost about 10,000 Japanese yen, but I think it was worth it.
>  ・Archive video of the main stage will be available at a later date
