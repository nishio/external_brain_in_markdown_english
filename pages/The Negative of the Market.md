- For a flow to occur, a combination of positives and negatives is necessary
    - The negative of the market ([[Needs]], shortages, deficiencies)
    - The positive created by the producer (product)
- When the negative of the market is clear
    - You can envision the "ideal product" that can fill that negative
    - You think it can be created by combining this and that
    - This is a hypothesis
    - When you actually try it, you might end up with something slightly different
- When the negative of the market is not clear
    - You envision a "new thing" that can be created by combining this and that
    - You think surely customers will be attracted to this "new thing"
    - This is a hypothesis
    - When you actually try it, you might realize there are no customers after making it
