title: "ADHD is the type of person who takes 30 years to mature."

> [hokennobro](https://twitter.com/hokennobro/status/1754797076607549683) I'm shocked that the "mental age of ADHD is 2/3 of actual age" story seems to be more than just a thing.
>  Dr. Catherine, who has been in clinical practice in the US for over 30 years, says that the frontal lobe of ADHD continues to mature until age 35, which is barely the same as the mental maturity of a person at age 21 in their late 30s.
>  Seriously.

- Doesn't sound like a thesis.

    - > Dr. Kathleen Nadeau, director of Chesapeake Psychological Services in Maryland and co-author of Understanding Girls with ADHD, says the maturation process for youth with ADHD is slow and not linear....
    - >  The frontal lobes of the brain involved in ADHD continue to mature until the age of 35. In practical terms, this means that people with ADHD can expect a reduction in symptoms over time. Many will not reach the emotional maturity of a 21-year-old until they are in their late 30s.
        - This is about the only scientific thing I have to say.

> [naoto_muranaka](https://twitter.com/naoto_muranaka/status/1755088949230620672) I think the "ADHD brain continues to mature until after age 30, so there is a scientific basis for the 30-year-old adulthood theory" should be considered in reverse. I believe it should be the other way around.
>  The problem of "the type of brain that takes 30 years to develop" appearing "developmentally challenged" at an early age.
>  Preconceived notions of "behind" and "far inferior" at some point in time.
- Mistake of regarding [[a great talent]] as inferior.
        - [[Blind Card Candidate]] Maybe.

> [naoto_muranaka](https://twitter.com/naoto_muranaka/status/1755091327241646469) The most essential issue is.
>  The identification of a person as "behind = disabled" at an early age, which ignores his/her pace of development and maturation and increases the pressure to conform to the "average speed".
>  And I believe that this structure has led to many cases in which the person's healthy development has been hindered.

> [naoto_muranaka](https://twitter.com/naoto_muranaka/status/1755094145579036759) In other words, a well-intentioned bad move to "somehow bring an inferior person closer to being like other people".
>  I think there is a fear that we may be preventing a person from reaching the maturity that he/she should have been able to reach.

(As a Doctor of Science, I should note in passing that these discussions are not based on new scientific facts, but rather that they are more like they are getting excited because they noticed a blind spot from a new point of view. It is an interesting perspective.)

If ADHD and others are "the type of people who take 30 years to mature", then humanity has made this possible by creating a society where people can take 30 years to mature and not die!
A newborn horse cub can run around, and a newborn human cub cannot run around until several years have passed. This is not because the human child is inferior, but because a safe society makes this possible.
The same could be said for ADHD.

If ADHD is the direction of human evolution, then the interpretation of this story changes again.
