I was realizing something similar on my end.
    - Using [PDF to PNG conversion
- Some people use a mechanism to hit curl from Automator.
But I thought it would be too costly to build a server to offer it to others, so I left it alone.
This technique can be packaged in the form of a browser extension by rendering PDF in JS

The search approach is "[[Display search results on Gyazo in Scrapbox]]".
- Not "[[Put Gyazo OCR text in Scrapbox]]".
