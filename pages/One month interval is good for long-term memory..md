The relationship between the interval between the first and second study and test scores six months after the second study under the condition of only one review.
- Black marker in the figure
    - The highest when the interval between the first and the second is one month.

- It depends on the question whether the higher grade is achieved by reviewing in a week or in 6 months.
    - Six months is higher for more difficult problems.
    - Either way, one month is the peak, and the spacing OR one day is lower than the other is the same.
- As test delays become multi-day, the optimal ratio approaches 0.1
- Past studies have strongly suggested that a 1-day gap is optimal, but those experiments had a TEST DELAY of 10 days or less
    - 1 month is optimal for a 6 month TEST DELAY

The old title was [[Effects of Interval Repetition Method]], but the title didn't really convey the content, so it was changed.
