title: "The Light of the Sentient: Human Destiny and Collective Wisdom"
---

The light of [[shared knowledge]]: man's [[destiny]] and [[collective wisdom]].

Summary: Human greatness cannot be achieved through individual wisdom. When the wisdom of people is fused together, it becomes wisdom and brings to life our destiny. It is the collective wisdom that brings into play the natural destiny that develops all things and creates human flourishing.

from  [[Proposing a New View of Humanity]]
>  Even those who have been endowed with these excellent characteristics are not always just and powerful when viewed individually in reality. We seek prosperity, but we often end up in poverty; we wish for peace, but we end up in strife; and we are often unhappy in our attempts to attain happiness.
>  Such a human reality is nothing but the result of not realizing one's own given destiny, and being obsessed with one's individual interests, gains and losses, and wisdom and talent.
>  In other words, human greatness cannot be fully realized by individual wisdom or individual power. When the wisdom of the ancients, moderns, and sages, as well as that of many others, is freely and unobtrusively enhanced and fused together, the sum total of the wisdom of the time becomes the wisdom of the people, and the wisdom of the people makes the most of their natural destiny. This is the greatest power to bring the laws of nature into reality in a wide range of community life and to realize man's destiny.
