title: "The Tower"

> The player becomes the manager of the building and expands it by installing various tenants. The goal is to raise the certified grade (number of stars) by increasing the population, etc., and to eventually achieve the highest title, "THE Tower". --- [The Tower (game) - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC_(%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0))

- The elevator is [[bottleneck]].

Maybe I did it back in the old Windows days and then did it again for nostalgia when the iPad version came out.

- [The second 1-coin download version of "The Tower DS" is available today - Blitz Online](https://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/205/205142/)
    - I don't recognize the DS version of the map selection screen.
- [The Tower" will be released by Digitoys in July. Digitoys to release that classic simulation "The Tower" in July](https://www.4gamer.net/games/115/G011588/20100715061/)

    - > An iPad version was released by Digitoys on August 5, 2010, based on The Tower 1.3J, with a touch panel optimized interface and the restriction that only one security office and some other facilities are available in each building. (Wikipedia)
        - > A Windows version was added in "Tower 1.2J" in 1995. It became possible to output objects for aqua zones in the shape of buildings that were later constructed... In 1996, "The Tower 1.3J" was released (free update from 1.2J was available if the user was registered).
        - Maybe this is because I was in middle school and high school at the time, so I don't think I paid for it myself, so I played the demo version in the magazine and played to the best part, but couldn't complete the game because it was the demo version.
    - You won't still have an iPad when the iPad version launches.
