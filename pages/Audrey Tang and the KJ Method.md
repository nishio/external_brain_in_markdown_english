title: "Audrey Tang and the KJ Method"

> The reason why we have this kind of collaboration meeting before is that the purpose of this meeting is to let the next board chairpersons, decision makers, or even doctors who will come to our school open the medicine certificate before they come. I have been working with one of my friends who is the president of the Medicine Association, the president of the Young Medicine Association, etc., and after experiencing it, I really like the change of their internal positions. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do this in the near future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it in the near future. --- [Audrey Tang [https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2020-04-01-%E7%8E%8B%E6%89%BF%E7%90%86%E8%94%A1%E5%AD%B8%E6%AC%A3%E4%BE%86%E8%A8%AA#s](https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2020-04-01-%E7%8E%8B%E6%89%BF%E7%90%86%E8%94%A1%E5%AD%B8%E6%AC%A3%E4%BE%86%E8%A8%AA#s) 397537]
Many professors also use some of it as teaching material when teaching this method. Since this is shared on Creative Commons (CC), many combinatorial effects can be created. Our purpose in holding these collaborative meetings is to provide this experience to board presidents and decision makers. For example, previous discussions about whether veterinarians could prescribe medications and whether animal owners could obtain human medications using the equivalent of a prescription at a human pharmacy were attended by the president of the Pharmacists Association and the president of the Young Pharmacists Association. They too were very satisfied with the experience and were highly motivated by the subsequent digital transformation.
They can say, "Tang Feng is doing this too, public institutions are using mind mapping and the KJ method. We can do the same". So far, we have processed more than 60 cases, with two to three board presidents or chairpersons participating each time. In this way, we are gradually spreading our influence.

The [[focus group method]] is primarily used to guide discussion and is appropriate when many people are talking together. Design thinking is not specifically for discussion, but for a larger framework. While [[design thinking]] works well for one or two people, the focus group method is especially effective with 20 or 50 people, allowing the energy to converge rather than diffuse. Thus, it addresses the converging part of design thinking, and there are other methods for the diffusing part.

Can you tell us about it?

For example, there is the [[KJ method]] invented in Japan. In this method, each person first writes down his/her opinion individually, then writes down "hopes" and "concerns," and pastes them in order.
