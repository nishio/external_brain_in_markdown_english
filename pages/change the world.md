title: "change the world"
---

For "[[change the world]]," there is person A who recognizes "[[I can change the world.]]" and person B who recognizes "[[I can't change the world.]]"

This is a difference in perception of "change" rather than ability.

For example, let's say Mr. A picked up a piece of trash on the floor and put it in a trash can.

From Mr. A's perspective, this is of course "changing the world.
- Because the state is different before and after the action.
- They "changed the world for the better" because they thought and acted on the idea that "the world would be better off without all the garbage on it."

For Mr. A, this level of "changing the world" is something he does on a daily basis
- So every once in a while, "Today we changed the world!" I don't say.
- Mr. A is accumulating [[success stories]] that he was able to change the world on a daily basis.
    - That's what pushes us to take on more difficult challenges.
    - It is a basis for not negating one's self-worth when difficult challenges fail.
        - Because they have succeeded so many times, failure is perceived as "I just happened to fail this time.

Mr. B, on the other hand, recognizes that this is not changing the world.
- I recognize "changing the world" as something bigger and better, something I can [[boast]] to those around me when I achieve it.
    - Vague and large, with no next action in sight.
    - Or the goal is so far away that I can't stay motivated until I get there.
        - [[A disease that demands great results from the start.]]

They believe they cannot change the world and do not act.
- I can't start because I can't see the next action.
- Or the goal is too far away to reach.

Trying something difficult and failing to achieve great results from the start
- And it reinforces the negative belief, "See, I knew I couldn't change the world.
    - [[learned helplessness]]
