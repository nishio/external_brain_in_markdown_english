title: "Data is the source of competitive advantage"
---

derived from  [[Is machine learning a swing back to the equipment industry?]]
- If [[data]] is the source of [[competitive edge]], how well it is collected ([[data collection efficiency]]) is the source of competitive advantage.

In a business model where data is gathered from customers' use of services, the more customers, the better.
    - [[dumping]] and the strategy to increase the number of customers will be established.
- Related: [[Amazon does not make a profit.]]

For business models that do not attract
- How to collect?
- Create a separate "business that collects data from service use".
