title: "What I learned only after 12 hours of drawing cylinders"

[I only realized this after 12 hours of drawing cylinders. It takes a lot of time to "realize" it, but everyone is taught first, right? | ■ Living Journey ■](http://izoomi-momo.jugem.jp/?eid=1243701) [archive [https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/http://izoomi-momo.jugem.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/http://izoomi-momo.jugem.) jp/?eid=1243701]

>  Don't think about completing [[rough sketch]]. The moment you think it, it becomes a chore.

> It's easy to teach how to draw. But the important thing is to realize it by yourself. People who are used to being taught become incapable of doing the same thing on their own. [[notice]] To have an eye, you need time to thoroughly face the object.
    - [[Have an eye to notice]]

>  "It doesn't make sense to fix just one part of the shape. When you think something is wrong, the whole thing is usually different somewhere. You have to correct all the different places a little bit at a time. That is the basic principle.
- >   [[When you think something is wrong, fixing just that part won't fix it.]] 。
- >  Even the places that you think are not strange are distorted a little bit, so you have to work on the whole thing.


- I didn't think I needed to make any more changes anywhere, but when I went away and looked closely for 10 minutes, it wasn't done at all.
        - [[thinking one has done it]]
