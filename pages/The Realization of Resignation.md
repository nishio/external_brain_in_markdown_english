> The difference between those who try to read the entire Twitter timeline and those who don't is whether or not they have the realization that it is impossible to read the entire timeline when the amount of information increases. In the same way, Scrapbox may be used differently depending on whether or not you have the realization that it is impossible to organize the entire information in a hierarchical manner when the information increases or when there are multiple people.
