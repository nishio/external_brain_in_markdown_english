The person who competes in a race grows faster with respect to the ability that can be measured in that race, but that alone does not allow him to decide his own path when placed in a situation without a goal. I didn't have the opportunity to experience that.

- > Should I train them or should I hold off on training them until they start doing it as spontaneously as possible?

    - The solution differs from the perspective of considering the optimum of society as a whole to the perspective of parents considering the [[local optimum]] of their own children.
    - As an example, in a situation where "society is looking for people who act spontaneously," "leave it to spontaneous action and ignore those who did not voluntarily train themselves" is rather close to [[global optimization]], but parents do not like their children to be ignored.
    - Time is finite, and there is a tremendous difference between acting out of [[spontaneous]] [[willingness (e.g., to do something)]] and [[acting without motivation when ordered to do so]] by parents, school, etc. The learning per hour is dramatically different.
        - So, I take the position that it's important to be spontaneous.
        - However, I think this may be because I don't have children....


relevance
    - [[Parable of Race and Search]]
    - [[Spontaneity cannot be forced.]]

- [[Total Optimization of Society]] and [[local optimum of parents]] are different
