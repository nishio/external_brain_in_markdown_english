1.### The fact that Mr. Kishida studied AI from the basics in Yutaka Matsuo's lab at the University of Tokyo
.
    - During his tenure as prime minister, he studied under Professor Yutaka Matsuo, taking lectures from the "basics of fundamentals" until he received a certificate of completion.
    - In actual office, parliamentary secretaries and others use tools such as Chat GPT to write greetings and collect documents.

2.### "Kishida-san's voice mimicry AI" demonstration episode in a car conversation
.
    - When Mr. Yasuno met Mr. Kishida for the first time during his tenure as prime minister (in a car-car dialogue), he improvised a voice conversion model that had been learned from Mr. Kishida's YouTube audio. The demonstration enlivened the surroundings.

3.### Personal Views on [[Deep Fake]] and Background on Hiroshima AI Process
.
    - As the first prime minister himself to be frequently used to deep faking, Kishida emphasized that "society as a whole needs to take action.
    - The "Hiroshima AI Process" was adopted at the G7 Hiroshima Summit, but this was due to my personal circumstances, as I was already aware of the risks of AI from an early stage, based on the advice of Mr. Yutaka Matsuo and others.

4.### Japanese perception of "[[DeepSeek]]" from China
.
    - While there is a general consensus that Japan is lagging behind when compared to the U.S. and Europe, where the scale of investment is larger, Mr. Kishida commented that the recent Chinese model (DeepSeek) showing "room for developing advanced AI at low cost" may be encouraging for Japanese companies.

5.### Into the "ecosystem" theory of AI investment
.
    - He emphasized the need for broad investment not only in AI R&D, but also in "data centers, power infrastructure, human resource training, and digital literacy improvement.
    - Whether it is realistically possible for Japan to inject funds in the tens of trillions of yen on a par with Europe and the U.S. is an issue, but a comprehensive approach that includes infrastructure (semiconductors and power infrastructure) and human resource development is essential, in his view.

6. ### "Digital Democracy 2030" initiative and political decision-making
.
    - Mr. Anno emphasized the use of AI in conjunction with the existing political system, which "uses AI to visualize and analyze the diverse opinions of the public, while politicians have the final say and are accountable for their actions.
    - Mr. Kishida also reaffirmed the point that "AI, which aggregates and analyzes a wide range of voices, is useful in assisting politicians in making decisions, but the ultimate responsibility lies with humans.

### In summary
.
- The "specific background of personal use of AI" by former prime ministers, such as the specific example of Mr. Kishida's learning at Matsuo's laboratory and his actual use of AI in his activities as a member of the Diet, has not been widely reported.
- Another major novelty of the program was that the discussion went deep into the deep-fake issue, the Hiroshima AI process, and the need for AI utilization, regulation, and international cooperation in the political arena, as well as AI investment trends in Europe, the U.S., and China.

1.### Policy making and use of AI "source indication"
.
    - Mr. Kishida emphasized that the emergence of "[[source-confident AI]]" would be very useful for government offices when analyzing vast amounts of data for policy making.
    - The ability to identify "where the information was obtained" in order to confirm the authenticity of the information presented by the AI is particularly welcomed in government.

2.### Speed Gap and AI Legislation
.
    - He noted that AI technology is advancing quickly, but it will take time to make policy and develop legislation.
    - Citing the example of the EU's rush to regulate AI, but construction is still several years away, "AI laws that balance risks and possibilities" are being discussed in Japan in the future.

3.### Characteristics of decision-making at the level of the Prime Minister
.
    - In a year, he made about "a dozen" decisions on "particularly difficult projects. They were large-scale and highly accountable, such as the strengthening of defense and energy policies.
    - He said that he often "woke up unexpectedly early in the morning and suddenly made up his mind." His personal episode of the importance of morning "inspiration" is a story that has not been publicized much.

4.### How "human-judged value" remains
.
    - No matter how advanced AI becomes, it is highly likely that the responsibility that humans ultimately bear and "[[people's]] empathy for the decisions they have to make after worrying about it" will remain in the world of politics.
    - Mr. Yasuno argued that "AI will be able to handle the intellectual work itself," but that there will still be "situations where [[a sense of satisfaction]] can be obtained because it is human.
