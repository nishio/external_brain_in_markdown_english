Dialogue Summary

What is plurality?
- Technology and democracy are not opposites but two sides of the same coin.
- Diversity is "a fact that already exists in the world" and plurality is "the engine that transforms diversity into creation.
- The idea is to turn the spark of division into "fuel for progress" through institutional design and technology.

2. model shown by Taiwan
- Ambiguous geopolitical positioning and dependence on the IT industry are the driving forces behind the creation of a "new national model.
- Leadership by Audrey Tang Feng:
    - Co-creating policies with open source and citizen participatory consensus building platforms.
    - A mechanism is in place for those under 18 years of age to be involved in the drafting of legislation.
- The case of the mask policy during the coronary period and the vaccination team are examples of how the conflict structure was replaced by a "team game.

3. possibilities for Japan and Asia
- The psychological hurdle to institutional renewal is low because of the flexible reinterpretation of "imported democracy" historically.
- The "multilayered, relational orientation" rooted in Eastern philosophy is compatible with the idea of plurality.
- Broad Listening" by Takahiro Yasuno:
    - Built with OSS just before the Tokyo gubernatorial election to collect citizens' opinions and organize issues using AI.
    - Although he lost the election, his methods were highly regarded and he participated in the creation of a long-term plan for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

4. innovation in voting and decision-making
- One person, one vote" is primitive. The objective is only "peaceful transfer of power.
- Setting rules that make it easier to make decisions by working together across parties and attributes (e.g., relaxing requirements for passage between different parties).
- Secondary Proposal:
    - "Quadratic Voting ([[QV]])" to distribute votes and reduce extremism.
    - Consideration of implementing a hierarchical and fluid representative system (e.g., [[liquid democracy]]) using a network structure.

5. education and youth empowerment
- Digital competence, not digital literacy:
    - Students participate in actual font development and fact-checking.
    - A program in which young people join local companies as "digital transformation supporters" and learn from each other.
- The non-voting generation also secures substantial influence by being deeply involved in the policy proposal process.

6. hope and a call to action
- Glenn Weil emphasized that "[[independence]] (AGENCY) is the key, not optimism/pessimism.
- Asia, especially Japan, Taiwan, and India, is in a phase where it can present a third democratic model that is neither Western nor Chinese.
- The message to the younger generation is not to mourn what has been lost, but to have the responsibility and opportunity to show the world.

main point
- Plurality is "a design concept that accelerates collaboration while maintaining diversity. Taiwan's practice and Japan's potential provide concrete examples of this concept and the next frontier. The participants called for continuing to evolve democracy "like a smartphone" by updating institutions, technology, and culture at the same time.
