In deep learning training, there are often cases where the performance difference between the [[globally optimal solution]] and the [[locally optimal solution]] is so small that the cost (huge computation and complex algorithms) of slightly better performance is not worth it. Similarly in life, there are cases where people are debating whether Plan A or Plan B is better, but in fact there is not much difference between the two.

In situations where there are many such "[[suboptimal]]" options, it may be more beneficial to adopt the current [[good enough option]] than to seek the "ultimate optimum" at the cost and risk. If the difference in the big picture is negligible, it is a wise decision to take the option that is marginally satisfactory and allocate the extra energy to something more important.
