title: "Human processing is a source of value"
---

The "human processing is the source of value" is open to misinterpretation and requires additional explanation

logic
- In information processing, information processing that can be done by machines inexpensively and in large quantities will have no value.
- Therefore, the source of value is "human processing" that machines cannot do.
- However, the limitation of "machines cannot" is important
    - Not all human processing is worthwhile.
