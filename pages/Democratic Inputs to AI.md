- [[Democratic Inputs to AI]]
    - On 5/25, OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, the "headquarters of AI," announced
    - OpenAI "supports experiments to improve democratic processes."
    - Total $1,000,000.00 ...... One hundred and ten thousand yen?
    - What is this? [[democratic process]]`? Why would OpenAI pay 100 million for this?`

- Objective of "Democratic Input to AI".
    - AI has far-reaching economic and social implications
    - It is not right that [[decision-making]] of "what AI should be" is done by "[[a]] few people" such as the management of a for-profit company.
        - Should be shaped by "[[Diverse perspectives]]" that reflect [public interest (e.g., public good)
    - Support experimental projects to take the first steps in this direction
    - Recruit a [[team]] to develop a [[proof of concept]] of a [[democratic process]] that can answer the question, "What are the rules that AI systems should follow?"
    - We (OpenAI) want to learn from these experiments and use them as the basis for a [[more global, more ambitious process]].
        - We hope to explore issues related to [[decision-making]] and build [[new democratic tools]] that can inform decision-making more directly in the future.

The following is provided as a summary of the OpenAI blog post "Democratic Inputs to AI" in Japanese bulleted format.
- OpenAI is launching a program to award ten $100,000 grants to fund experiments to set up a democratic process for determining what rules AI systems should follow.
- AI shapes the lives of individual people, the way they interact, and the way society as a whole evolves. As such, decisions about AI behavior should be shaped by a diversity of perspectives that reflect the public interest.
- AI needs more detailed and adaptive guidelines beyond the legal framework. No single individual, company, or country should dictate these decisions.
- This grant program is being initiated as a first step in this direction. Teams from around the world are invited to develop a proof of concept of a democratic process for answering questions about what rules AI systems should follow.
- Decisions regarding the governance of the most powerful systems and their deployment require strong public oversight. This grant is offered as a step toward establishing a democratic process for oversight of AGI and ultimately superintelligence.
- By "democratic process" we mean a process in which a broad representative group exchanges views, engages in interactive discussions, and ultimately determines the outcome through a transparent decision-making process.
- To apply for a grant, you are invited to submit the required application materials by June 24, 2023 at 9:00 PM PST. Successful grant recipients may be individuals, teams, or organizations. Each recipient will receive a $100,000 grant to pilot the proposal described in the application materials.
