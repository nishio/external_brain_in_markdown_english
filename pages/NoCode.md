Regarding NoCode, I've seen people talk about the set of newly written programs in their minds and say that "NoCode can only do a portion of what NoCode can do" or "There are things that NoCode can't cover," but I think this is a limited view.

They are narrowing their vision to only "problems that can be solved by writing a new program."

- The way I see it, "What NoCode can cover is only part of the story."


Only a part of the jobs that customers want to solve can be solved by writing a new program.

- Most errands are being taken care of with a combination of existing tools.
    - It could be pen and paper or Excel and email.
    - There are options that are not originally "write a new program".
    - The addition of a new NoCode tool (N) here is nothing special from a customer perspective.

    - Customers use whatever tools are handy to get their own errands done.

Technically, any problem that can be solved by using the NoCode tool can also be solved by writing a program.
- In other words, what NoCode is trying to solve is not a technical problem in the first place.
- Many of our clients have errands that are being handled without programming at this time.
    - A program to help with this would increase productivity.
    - But we can't make it in-house.
    - Outsourcing the program would solve the problem, but the cost is too high compared to the expected utility, so it is not outsourced.
- NoCode is going to take this area.

If the NoCode tool is in the cloud and API rich, you can automate errands by writing programs
- This is an interesting point for programmers
- It can be automated with far less work than writing a program to do an entire errand.
- This area (LowCode) is created by the proliferation of NoCode tools that are aware of creating this area.
    - Specifically, API maintenance, sample code release, etc.
- From the customer's perspective, NoCode is just another way to run errands.
    - From the customer's perspective, "pen and paper", "apps without APIs", and NoCode tools are just "one of the tools to run errands".
    - Programmers are more likely to provide value if they are asked to use NoCode tools.
- This "LowCode area being created" is interesting from a programmer's perspective, but many people don't get it from a customer's perspective.
    - In the long run, the effect is to make the "automation of errands" easier to obtain.
    - I feel like I still have to put a lot of time and effort into recognition to get people to recognize me.

    - I think this diagram is not good, the definition area is unclear.
    - It's funny that the same diagram shows the jobs that will be created after the spread of NoCode.
